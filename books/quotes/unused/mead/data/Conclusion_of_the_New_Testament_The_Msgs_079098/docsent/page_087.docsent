   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Speaking with the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finally, the Spirit speaks with the church: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In chapters two and three of Revelation it was the Spirit speaking to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here, at the end of the book, it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates the improvement of the church in experiencing the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the New Testament the Spirit signifies the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually the Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen that Revelation 22:17 says, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no expression in human language greater than this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man are married and become a universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man become one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here in Revelation 22:17 we have two consummations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Divinity has gone through a process incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to become the Spirit, the totality, the consummation, of the Triune God to be the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Humanity also has gone through a process redemption, regeneration, and transformation to become the consummation of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The consummation of the Triune God and the consummation of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people become one in a universal marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Triune God marries the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here is an eternal couple expressing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For eternity the tripartite man will enjoy the Triune God and match Him for His full expression and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these messages we have covered four sections of the Spirit's work in the believers: first, the section from initial sanctification, enlightenment, and regeneration through continual sanctification; second, the section of the working of the inner life; third, the section of the work to maintain the divine fellowship; and fourth, the section of the church, ministry, service, and work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From this we see that the work of the Spirit covers all areas of the Christian life and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christian life and ministry are altogether in the Spirit, with the Spirit, and of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Apart from the all-inclusive Spirit, we can have neither the Christian life nor the Christian ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we need the infilling of the Holy Spirit and also the outpouring of the Holy Spirit so that we may have an adequate Christian life and work.</S>
