<div class='line'><b>1</b> Every new day's a new start.</div>
<div class='line'>Lord, again we're coming to You.</div>
<div class='line'>Lord, could You ever break through within us</div>
<div class='line'>If, Lord, we gave You a part?</div>

<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>O Lord, we can't do it on our own.</div>
<div class='line'>O Lord Jesus, how we need You!</div>
<div class='line'>Win us, woo us, to Thyself, Lord,</div>
<div class='line'>That we'd ever stay, Lord, with You.</div>

<div class='line'><b>2</b> Lord, before time had begun,</div>
<div class='line'>We were marked and called out by You.</div>
<div class='line'>We had no choice, we were trapped by You, Lord;</div>
<div class='line'>We had no place we could run.</div>

<div class='line'><b>3</b> Some of my friends are so free.</div>
<div class='line'>Who could I blame, Lord, but Thee?</div>
<div class='line'>I cannot do all the things that they do</div>
<div class='line'>Because You set me apart.</div>
</div>

<div class='line'><b>4</b> Lord, I'm realizing that</div>
<div class='line'>Loving You's a tender trap.</div>
<div class='line'>Since You have kissed me, my heart has melted;</div>
<div class='line'>All my resistance has cracked.</div>
