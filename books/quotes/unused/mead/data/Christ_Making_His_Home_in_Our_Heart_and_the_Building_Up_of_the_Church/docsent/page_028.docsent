   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A NORMAL OVERCOMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRISTIAN LIFE ALWAYS HAVING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE LORD S PRESENCE MANIFESTATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What kind of living should we have after we are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the focus of our fellowship in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After we are saved, the Lord should continually manifest Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should have His face and His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, the Lord should make His abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We will first consider the Lord s manifestation and then consider the Lord making an abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose two people are sitting together, facing each other.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Each one has the other s manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If one goes to another room, he will become hidden, and the other will no longer have his manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as one cannot see the other, he does not have the other s manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The other will be manifested only when he returns.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, in order to have someone s manifestation, we must be able to see his face.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a person is saved, if his living is normal and overcoming, he should constantly have the Lord s manifestation, the Lord s face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that we all have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times we have had the Lord s face.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We did not see His face physically, but we had His face within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our inner being we were very clear that the Lord was manifesting Himself to us and that His presence was with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, there have been many times when we knew that the Lord was not manifesting Himself to us; instead, He was hidden from us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The young brothers and sisters are often concerned about watching movies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many of them have argued with me, saying, Why can we not go to the movies?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do not have to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I only ask, While you are watching the movie, is the Lord Jesus with you?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Does He manifest Himself to you?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is His face with you?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you have the shining of His face?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being a Christian is not a matter of sin or of love for the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Being a Christian is a matter of having the Lord s presence by seeing His face.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fundamentally, being a Christian is not a matter of dealing with the world or sins, nor is it a matter of doing good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Being a Christian is entirely a matter of having the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, our primary concern is not dealing with sin or the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our primary concern is our dealing with the Lord, that is, our relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether or not a person is saved does not depend on whether he sins or loves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it depends on his relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the only thing that matters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Similarly, whether or not a believer can have an overcoming life does not depend on the things he does, nor does it depend on whether he deals with sins and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His life depends on how he deals with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if we do not sin, if the Lord hides His face from us, it will be difficult for us to have a good Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Losing the Lord s presence is something that Christians should fear more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes people say, Brother Lee, you are always giving messages; you speak daily and even many times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are concerned for you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if you have three hundred topics, sooner or later you will exhaust them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then what will you do?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Will you still give messages?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I always say, I am not worried about running out of messages.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What I fear is losing the Lord s presence, His manifestation, His face.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not concerned about whether I have something to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To me, the most fearful thing is that the Lord would hide His face from me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am fearful that the Lord would not manifest Himself to me and would not be with me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is what I fear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Lord s presence is with me, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have the Lord s face, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There will be messages to give and words to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have the Lord s face, all sinful things will be under our feet, and the world will be behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, a Christian must not lose the Lord s face, the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you have the Lord s face, His manifestation, His presence?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should not take this as a matter of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you leave your home, does the Lord say, My face will go with you ?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What do you say?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Perhaps you say, Lord, I am going out.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If You do not go with me, I will not go.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>My going out is Your business, not mine.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If Your face, Your presence, does not come with me, I will not go.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you contact the Lord in this way, the Lord will say, I will go with you, and you will always have His manifestation, His face.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must always ask whether you have the Lord s presence, His manifestation.</S>
