One day I was on a ship, and I did not see any brother. It made my spirit depressed. Here, you have too many brothers. This may cause you to take things for granted. In Kutien, one brother had to travel seven days to visit another brother and had to spend eight days for the return journey. The traveling alone took him fifteen days. In our heart, we fellowship with the Christ in heaven. But while we remain in our bodies, we still have to seek for the fellowship of the brothers who are visible.</P><P>I was invited by someone to visit Hsien-yu, and I thought that I could be back home in one or two months. But once I was there, I was kept from coming back. This was a foolish thing for me to do. It was not until Brother Witness Lee came to me that I returned home. Today, it is not a question of doctrine, but a question of life. A man can listen to Charles Spurgeon speak for twelve years and still not be saved. Yet when he touches life, he will be saved. In the same way, we only have to touch the Body once. We are coming forward to the heavenly Jerusalem. There we have Paul and Peter; this heavenly worship also includes us. Here is no limitation of time and space; what is theirs is ours also. By this, the individuals receive the riches of the Body.</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LIFE OF THE BODY<br>AND THE LIVING IN THE BODY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Every Life Having Its Own Characteristics,<br>Demands, and Tastes</H2><P>Brother Witness Lee:With the Lord's salvation, there is the life. This is different from all teachings, doctrines, religions, or philosophies. The Lord's salvation does not cause us to do something in an outward way. This life has its own demands and characteristics. The fish has the characteristics of a fish, and the bird has the characteristics of a bird. Every living thing has its own characteristics, and each kind of life has its own taste. The fish needs to live in the water. We do not have to tell the fish, "You should live in the water. This is proper and right." When we eat, the food meets the need within us. This need within us causes us to realize that the food is good, sweet, and pleasant.</P><P>There are things that we do not like. Yet, if you put these things in front of a pig, it may think that they are very good. On the other hand, the food that you like, such as chocolate, oranges, or peaches, may not be appealing to the pig when they are placed before it. Why is this so? It is because there is a difference in life that results in a difference in taste.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Living in the Body<br>by the Demand of the Body Life</H2><P>A person is not a Christian according to teaching, but according to taste. It is a matter of the demand of the life within. Only those Christians who live according to this demand and this taste are "standard" Christians. Why would you not sin after you are saved? Is it because the Bible teaches you so? Is it because you are afraid that the church would excommunicate you? We do not sin because we do not feel comfortable within if we sin. We act righteously, live a holy life, and walk in the light because we feel uncomfortable within if we do not do these things. A Christian loves others because the life within him is a loving life. The life that we have received at salvation is a Body life; it is a corporate life. It demands that you serve God together with all the saints. Is it possible for a person to be saved and yet not meet with others? Will he be happy? Surely he will not be happy.</P><P>Some have said that, after a person has been a Christian for a long time, meetings will become tasteless to him. If you have lost your taste for the meetings in Shanghai, try to go to Soochow to study the Bible and to pray alone. Immediately, you will see that this will not meet the inward demand. The life within demands that we mingle together with all the saints in fellowship and coordination. By yourself, you can ride in the clouds all alone. But let me ask you: When Brother Chen Keh-san was in Hsien-yu, was he comfortable? Did he not feel like a hanging corpse, being neither in heaven nor on earth? When I arrived at Kulongsu, he was still trying to stay at Hsien-yu. Of course, in the end he still came. The first day we spoke, he began to cry. He said, "For so many years, I did not know where I was." If your hands remain in your Body, they look fine. But if the hands are cut off from the Body and are hung on a tree, will they look fine? If you see such hands, you will surely be startled. That would surely be like a hanging corpse.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_183.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_185.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 184</div><br></body></html>
