For example, it is easy to understand the terms fleshly and spiritual according to the letter, but it is difficult to differentiate between the two in our living. How can we tell if our goodness and righteousness come from the first or the second? Is there any mark that can help us clearly identify which is which? Let me tell you a law: everything that is spiritual has passed through death. Those who have experience will say "amen" to this. In other words, everything spiritual is in resurrection. Anything that comes from birth, that we can acquire without the need for God's strength, is of the first. All the cleverness, loveliness, goodness, and talents that we possess from the time of our birth until the time we believe in the Lord are considered to be fleshly by God. Everything that falls within this period cannot please God. Anything that God puts in after regeneration and that God adds to us through the Spirit from the time when we believed in the Lord Jesus is of the second. As far as natural virtues are concerned, they should be specifically rejected; we should not live by them and boast in them. Instead, we should trust helplessly in the Holy Spirit, looking to Him for guidance and beseeching Him for strength, victory, and the way to live out Christ. Everything that is of the second is from God and requires the specific denial of our own wisdom, strength, and natural abilities. Only after this denial do we have what is resurrected, spiritual, and from the second.</P><P>We have received too little of the second from God! We have lived too infrequently according to the second! What do we do all the time? We try to take away the evil things from the first and borrow the good things. But God says even though evil, filthy, and sinful things should be removed, our naturally clever, talented, meek, and lovely things should also be dropped and passed through death. We may think: if we should not use our own cleverness, should we be senseless? If we should not use our meekness, should we be blunt? No. It merely means that God wants to bring everything through death. For example, I may be a very clever person and may be able to find many new ideas in the Bible through my cleverness. However, I will not trust in my cleverness, but in God alone. I will trust in God in reading the Bible and in prayer. Without trusting in God, I can do nothing. The Bible says that "apart from Me you can do nothing" (John 15:5). If we do this nothing apart from Him, we will pass through death, and our self will be abandoned. We will see God use our renewed wisdom, and we will see God take and use everything that has passed through death and the cross.</P><P>This is indeed a suffering life! How painful is this type of life! If we live this way, we will lose all our freedom. We should not do anything quickly. We have to wait on God, pray more, and know our uselessness and corruption. Yet only this life is a fruit-bearing life. "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24). Many people are not willing to adopt this attitude. Therefore, they live in the first all their life. They never live in the second because their natural being has not died. Although they look good outwardly, they cannot bear genuine spiritual fruit. Consider the example of the Lord Jesus who did not know sin. If He had said anything by Himself, He would not have been wrong. If He had done anything by Himself, He would surely have done it well because He was sinless, clean, and without blemish. His life and nature was perfect. Yet He said that He could do nothing or say nothing by Himself. He only spoke what He heard from the Father. Why would He not do things according to Himself? He realized that to do this would be natural and not be according to God. Even a person like the Lord Jesus, whose natural being was perfect, clean, and beautiful, did not follow Himself. How much more we should do the same! The Lord came from heaven. He did not trust in His perfect flesh, but trusted in the Holy Spirit. How much more should we do the same! The way that He insisted on walking according to God's will and by the power of the Holy Spirit shows us that being sinless alone is not enough. Our life must not be one that merely overcomes sin; it must also overcome the flesh. It must not only overcome filthiness, but must overcome the natural being. God's life has been too suppressed by our natural being. Our life and work have been too controlled by our own will and too motivated by our own wisdom. We have tried to serve God by our own strength too much. God's calling today is that we see the futility of everything that comes from the natural realm so that we will humble and empty ourselves before God, obey, and trust in Him entirely.</P><P>I admit that this is a painful way! This life is a dependent life, a lowly life, a life of bondage, imprisonment, and slavery. This kind of life is a suffering life. If you live by the second, you will be humbled and bound as a prisoner and slave every day. But this is the only kind of life that pleases God. Only this kind of work is spiritually effective. Everything from the flesh, whether it is fleshly holiness or fleshly zeal, amounts to nothing in God's eyes as long as it comes from the natural instinct or emotional impulse.</P><P>Finally, let us remember that anything we can do, will do, or are able to do without much prayer, without a full trust in God, and without the power of the Holy Spirit, is not pleasing to God and will be surely condemned by Him because it is something from the flesh. All that we have must be received humbly through trusting in God. May we put the natural life to death daily by God's life until the day the Lord returns. May God's new creation swallow up our old creation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 09: The Present Testimony (2) &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
