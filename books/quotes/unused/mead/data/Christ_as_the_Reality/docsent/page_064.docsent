   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A RECOVERY WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord is doing a recovery work in which He needs a people who realize and take Him as their humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the midst of the degradation of the churches and the corruption of society, we are here for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But for this we need a strong and proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not sufficient simply to shout, "Hallelujah!" or "Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not enough to have divine healing or the so-called power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must show this generation, and even the entire universe with the Devil and all his demons, that we are taking the proper humanity to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must declare and even proclaim to this universe that we are here as genuine men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are here as a corporate man taking Jesus as our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This will terrify the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tempter came to the Lord Jesus and said, "If You are the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>" But the Lord Jesus answered by referring to Himself as a man Matt 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That terrified the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must be "Jesusly" human.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every member of the church in the Lord's recovery must be a proper man, even an "acacia" man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will be a strong testimony, and the mouth of the enemy will be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I realize that many people today are waiting to criticize the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever they are wrong, they will justify it, but when we are wrong in anything, they will tell everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is only one way to shut their mouths, and that is by expressing the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Their conscience will have to agree with the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So many opposing ones are waiting for the churches to fail.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are looking for any failure on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is really a kind of suffering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many of us were never opposed or criticized so much as when we came into the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be in the local church is to collect much criticism from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But this is not really criticism, it is something of the battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we cannot fight the battle without the proper humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The proper humanity for the Lord's recovery will surely shut all the critical, opposing mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE PROPER WAY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then what is the way to enjoy such a humanity?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the above verses we are able to see five main items.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By these we can see the Apostle Paul's concept concerning the way to take the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first was to call on the name of the Lord from a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we call on the name of the Lord, we are really taking His humanity into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Paul referred to the Scriptures: "All Scripture is God-breathed " 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All Scripture is breathed out by God to make us genuine and proper men of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We not only need to call on the Lord, but we must also breathe in every word of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is simply to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How important are these two items for taking the Lord's humanity!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must call on the Lord, and we must breathe in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The third item is the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul did not say simply to call on the Lord by yourself, but with "those" 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We enjoy the Lord's humanity by being with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Fourth, Paul tells us that we have a spirit to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind" 2 Tim 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And fifth, we have a wonderful Person in our spirit: "The Lord be with your spirit" 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have these five matters to practice: calling on the Lord, breathing in the Scriptures, having the Body life, exercising our spirit, and realizing the Lord Jesus within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This reveals the concept of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can we enjoy the humanity of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Simply by these five things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to call on the Lord, we must breathe in the Word, and we must do these things in a Body way in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this we have such a strengthening factor in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus, who is the real humanity, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By exercising our spirit to call on Him and to breathe in the Word in a corporate way, we simply enjoy His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Suppose that I am a young man, seventeen years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I exercise my spirit to call on the Lord and to pray-read His Word with the brothers and sisters, do you believe that I could be disobedient to my parents?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I do not believe so.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There would be no need of anyone telling me to obey my parents.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Spontaneously, I would be obedient to my parents because of the humanity of Jesus within me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>And if I have been doing these things in the church life, do you believe that I could be boastful or arrogant?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Never!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since I would have the proper humanity within me, I could never behave in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This issue does not come by teaching, but by feeding on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The proper enjoyment of the humanity of Jesus will swallow up all the negative things and replace them with all the positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must pray for the entire situation of the Lord's recovery, that all the brothers and sisters in the local churches may have a full enjoyment of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then we will be the acacia boards, standing steadfastly against the current of this evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This will be our strong testimony, and this will bring the recovery of the local church life to all the leading cities.</S>
