   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOLDING TO TRUTH IN LOVE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GROWING UP INTO CHRIST IN ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fourth and fifth points in Ephesians 4 are growth and holding to truth, that is, holding Christ as the reality vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the proper growth we drop many things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not think that to grow mainly means to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, the more we grow, the more things we drop.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The younger the children are, the more things they try to grasp.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They like to collect and hold on to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the more children grow, the more things they drop, including many of their toys.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To arrive at a full-grown man is to drop the doctrines and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MINISTERING TO THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sixth item in chapter 4 is our function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 16 says, Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we hold Christ as the reality, we grow up into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we receive something from Him to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all have received something from the Head to minister to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is our function, which depends upon our growth and our receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we grow into Christ, we receive something from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we function effectually with what we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our experience of Christ becomes something real to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not wish to criticize others, but we must realize that many Christians today are not clear about the real meaning of function.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The genuine function is the ministry of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We grow in Christ, and we grow into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we partake of Christ, we have some experience, and we receive something of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then when we come to the church meeting, we share with others what we have partaken of.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the real way to function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Building Up the Church Not by Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>but by the Growth in Life</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was young, I had the natural concept that function is a matter of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Ephesians 4, however, this kind of gift is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When this chapter speaks of gifts, it denotes the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the gift is a person, such as the apostle himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two sister books of Ephesians and Colossians deal with the universal man, Colossians with the Head and Ephesians with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Ephesians, the book that deals particularly with the Body, there is no mention of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, this book speaks of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 15 of chapter 4 says, Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then verse 16 begins, Out from whom, indicating that we receive something of life from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can never build up a local church by the so-called gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Apart from life and the growth of life, the more gifts we have, the more divisions there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Gifts create divisions unless they are balanced by the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot find such gifts in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, this book is full of life and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the whole of Christianity today we can hear almost no messages telling us that our function depends on the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>People mostly say that function depends on the gifts, that if a person is gifted, he knows how to function.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In actuality, we build up the Body not by the gifts but by the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a person has only gifts without the growth of life, he will cause a problem in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I appreciate verses 15 and 16.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 15 there is the growth into Christ, and in verse 16 there is the function.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How much we can function and minister to others depends on our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we grow up into Christ, the more we have something of Christ to minister to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have no growth, it will be impossible to have any building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Body Building Itself Up</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>by All the Perfected Members</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 16 speaks of the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Body builds up itself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The building of the Body is not carried out by others but by the members of the Body directly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ the Head does not build the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He builds the church through the gifted persons, but neither do the gifted persons build the church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They build the church indirectly by perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then it is through the perfected saints directly that the church is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, all these saints need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why 1 Corinthians 3:9 speaks of two aspects, God s cultivated land and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The apostle Paul learned how to plant, how to water, and how to help people to grow, and he also learned how to build.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The building depends upon the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For this purpose we cannot merely talk about coordination and the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must help people to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more growth we have, the more building we will realize.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do not know how to carry out all the above matters, we can have no confidence that we are in the real and proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We will be only a group meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For the proper church life we must have all these items.</S>
