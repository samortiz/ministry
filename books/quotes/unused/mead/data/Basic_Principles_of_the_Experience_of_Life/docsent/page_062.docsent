   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN TRANSFORMATION 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45; 1 Thes 5:23; Matt 27:45-46; Col 3:4; 1 John 5:11-12; Col 1:13; 2 Cor 3:18; 1 John 3:1-2; Rom 8:19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will present a brief outline of what we have seen so far concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this purpose, we will use the twelve charts arranged on pages 166-167.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To my realization, these charts are the best of their kind in all the publications of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were prepared by an American sister named Mary E. McDonough, who only recently left to be with the Lord, for her book God's Plan of Redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is remarkable that we cannot find this book in almost any Christian bookstore in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Shortly after this book was written in 1922, it was translated into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the translator was not clear about the way of life, so we did not agree with his translation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>About fifteen years ago we retranslated it into Chinese, and we published it in our bookrooms in Shanghai and in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This book was eagerly accepted and familiar to all the brothers and sisters in the Far East, and they received much help from it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I myself have used it in North China, in Shanghai, in Taiwan, and in the Philippines to help people several times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The charts presented here are very revealing, giving us a clear vision and impressing us with God's plan, His way in His redemption, and the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE UNCREATED, ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first chart, Figure 1, contains a golden circle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In its spiritual meaning a circle denotes something eternal, something without beginning or end. If someone puts his finger on a point of a circle, he cannot say what part of the circle comes before it and what part comes after it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With God there is no limit of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, this circle signifies the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the types in the Scriptures, gold signifies the nature of God, that is, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is very clear with the types in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of the furnishings in the tabernacle, such as the ark and the showbread table, were made either of gold or of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are types of the Lord Jesus with His two natures the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The acacia wood represents His human nature, and the gold represents His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The divine life is the Triune God, and this life is the self-existing, eternal, uncreated, and unlimited life, without beginning and without end. MAN AS THE CREATED AND FALLEN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Figure 2 signifies that the Triune God created a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God created man because God desires to express Himself through man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Scriptures clearly tell us that man is a vessel to contain God in order to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man is not eternal; he has a beginning in time, signified by the vertical line at the top of the circle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we know, this man is the first Adam 1 Cor 15:45a , who is the created, limited life with a beginning and an end. This life, as it was created, was good, pure, and sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Figure 3 shows us that the man created by God as a vessel to contain God has three parts a spirit, a soul, and a body 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirit is the inner content to contain and contact God, who is Spirit, while the body is the outward appearance to contact the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Between the inward spirit and the outward body is the soul as a medium, which is the personality of man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With this tripartite man there was no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Figure 4 requires little explanation; we are clear just by looking at it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every part has become dark; this is the fallen Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man was made as a vessel to contain God, but before God came into him, something else came in. That was Satan, the enemy of God, personified Sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the universe a particular creature, Satan, rebelled against God and became the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now Satan is the very Sin in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Satan came into the created life, so the whole person of man body, soul, and spirit was corrupted, damaged, and spoiled by Satan as Sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fallen man became filled with Sin and possessed by Satan, and his every part is full of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all know how much corruption has come out of this corrupted human being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is truly dark, corrupted in body, corrupted in soul, and corrupted in spirit.</S>
