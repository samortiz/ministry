   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF REALITY FOR THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD Sent by the Son from with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The verses in the Scripture reading at the beginning of this chapter are firstly from the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Gospel of John begins with "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It goes on to say, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him" v. 18 . This book starts with God, goes on to show us the Father, and continues to show us that He is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence we have God, the Father, and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 15:26 the Lord said, "But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse the Son, not the Father, is the Sender of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Son sent the Spirit from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From may be better translated as from with see Darby's New Translation, 1:14, 15:26, and notes .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit of reality comes not only from the Father but with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When He comes, the Father comes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse reveals the reality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are here, and the Son is the Sender of the Spirit who comes from with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Making Christ Real to Us by His Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one, but They are also three for dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father is in the heavens, but the Son is here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though the Son was with the disciples, He could not enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, there is the need of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Spirit came, He entered into the disciples 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Spirit who is in us is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit of reality indicates that the Spirit makes everything the Son spoke to the disciples real.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus said, "I am the way and the reality and the life" 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without the Spirit entering into us, the Lord being life would not be real to us; it would merely be a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Spirit comes into us, He guides us into the reality that Christ is the life, because the Spirit is the reality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What Christ spoke was His word, but when the Spirit comes, He makes Christ's word real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The coming of the Spirit of reality is the dispensing of the Triune God, the dispensing of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the Breath to Bring the Triune God into Us</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must read the Gospel of John again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First we have the Word and God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God" 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally we have the breath 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the beginning of this book, in chapter one, is the Word which was God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the end, in chapter twenty, is the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you believe that this breath is something separate from the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This breath is the Word, and this breath is also God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this breath we have the Spirit, the Son, the Father, God, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This breath is the dispensing of Jesus, the dispensing of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today we receive the breath simply by breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By breathing this breath in, we receive the Spirit, the Son, the Father, God, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the dispensing of Jesus into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Becoming the Sevenfold Intensified Spirit for the Dispensing of God into Us</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Bible first reveals God, Jehovah, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Following this, so many books in the Old Testament show us something about the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then in the New Testament there are at least four books, the Gospels, about the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the end of His life, the Son told us that He would send the Spirit from with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From here we go on to the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the book of Acts we mainly have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then after all the Epistles is the last book, Revelation, which speaks of the sevenfold intensified Spirit 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible starts with God and ends with the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All this is for the dispensing of God into us.</S>
