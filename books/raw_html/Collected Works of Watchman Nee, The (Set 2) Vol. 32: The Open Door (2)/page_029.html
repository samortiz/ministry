<h2 class="head2">Changchow, Fukien Province</h2><p>The brothers and sisters in Changchow have scattered all over the inland regions because of the war. Brothers Deng Tsu-chin, Chen Jin-chuen, and Chang Li-jin are in Lung-Yen. Brother Chen Wen-zhang, Sister Tseng Bi-lien, and Brother Kuo Shu-fan are in Hwa-An County. Brother Dai Jen-tsia is in Chang-Tai County. Praise the Lord that He has preserved us in peace. The denomination in Hwa-An often invites the brothers to preach. The pastor of the denomination is quite humble, and he has invited Brothers Chang Tung-yuen and Han Jin-siu to conduct conferences there. We see the reality of the open door. May the Lord's truth spread during this time, may the church be built, and may the Lord's name be glorified, amen. I have written this letter to ease the concern of those brothers and sisters who know us. Please pray for us.</p><p>Brother Kuo Shu-fan, June 23<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Pu-Tien, Fukien Province</h2><p>Recently Brother Chen Ke-san received a letter from Brother Chou Tsung-hwei, telling of Mr. and Mrs. Lu Hua-seng, who were living in their relatives' homes. One day the house was bombed, and the unbelievers in the house were killed. But these two were preserved. A few months ago, the city of Changchow was bombed. One brother was in the middle of the bombing. When the dust settled down, some people had been killed right next to him. All of this proves God's wonderful provision for His children. We cannot help but say, "Hallelujah, Praise the Lord!" Most of the brothers and sisters in Ding-Wei have moved to inland regions; only a few poor believers remain. Sui-Tou was also bombed. The meetings there have stopped, and the brothers and sisters are scattered in the inland regions. Other places like An-Hai, Shi-Shee, Chuenchow, Tseng-Mao, and Tung-Yuen are meeting as usual. The brothers and sisters are all safe. The meetings in Fu-Ching, Pu-Tien, and Shien-You have not stopped, and the saints are safe. Nevertheless, all the brothers and sisters in the south and middle part of Fukien still need your prayer.</p><p>Brother Chai Tse-chung, June 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tien-Sui, Kansu Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear co-worker Sister Peace Wang:</p><p>By the Lord's grace, I was happy to see you and Brother Witness Lee in Sian last year. I am an elder and bishop in seven churches in Lung-Nan in Kansu, and I feel a deep need for the messages of Brother Nee. If some brothers and sisters would like to take up this commission to come to Kansu, I and the brothers and sisters here will most warmly welcome you. Please remember this matter in your prayer. Greetings.</p><p>Brother Ji Shi-chang<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Thank the Lord that He has led me to participate in the pioneer work in the border regions of the northwest. Although we have learned many lessons, He has commissioned us to do some work. We have over ten co-workers in all. Three of them are engaged in medical work, while the others are strictly working on evangelism. We are all blessed. About fifty people have been saved during the past three months, and over ten village churches have been raised up. At present we are erecting a church building in Living Stone Village, where Brother Ji is. We have much work here, but the workers are few. We hope and pray that God would send some who would deny themselves to co-work with us. Greetings. Sister Chang Feng-yun and Sister Liu Feng-jen (nurse) send their greetings to the sisters.</p><p>Brother Gung Shou-ren<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(The work in Kansu by brothers such as Gung Shou-ren and Duan Chai-ju is touching as far as their zeal and perseverance is concerned. We are sympathetic to their cause in the preaching of the gospel. May the Lord bless them. Perhaps they have not seen what we have seen concerning the establishment of the local church, the work and the church, and the apostles and the elders. We hope that Brothers Gung, Ji, and Duan would search the Scriptures carefully so that the work would belong to the work and the church would belong to the church. May the Lord grant us the grace to return to the original pattern God set up for us in the Bible&mdash;Editor.)</p>
