   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN HEBRON THE PLACE OF FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the end of chapter twenty-two, Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were dwelling at Beer-sheba, undoubtedly living near the covenanted well and the tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was a miniature of the church life, for the church life is always by a well of living water and a tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suddenly, at the beginning of chapter twenty-three we are told of Sarah's death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were living at Beer-sheba, she died and was buried in Hebron, the place of fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sarah went on from Beer-sheba to Hebron.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In like manner, if the Lord delays His coming back, I would like to live in the church life and die in the fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the map, Hebron is between Beer-sheba on the south and Jerusalem on the north.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is on the way from Beer-sheba to Moriah, where Jerusalem is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the Lord delays His coming back, I would like to be buried in a place which is on the way to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Where are you living today?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all must answer that we are living in Beer-sheba, in the church by the well of living water and the tamarisk tree.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our church life is today's Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before the Lord comes back, some of the older ones may leave Beer-sheba, the church life, die in Hebron, and wait there for the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebron is not only a place of fellowship with God; it is also a way to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cave of Machpelah in Hebron is the gateway to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps some day we shall hear Sarah testify, "When I entered into the cave of Machpelah, I entered into the gate which leads into the New Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sarah was not simply buried in the cave of Machpelah; she is now sleeping there, waiting for the day when she will wake up and find herself in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>SARAH'S EARLY DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sarah died at the age of one hundred twenty-seven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although this may seem to be very old today, at that time it was an early age to die.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five years 25:7 , living thirty-eight years after Sarah died.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sarah should not have died at such an early age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Her death, thirty-seven years after Isaac's birth 17:1, 17; 21:5 , was abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>ABRAHAM'S SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abraham and Sarah were the best couple in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They truly loved one another, never having any consideration of divorce or separation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Abraham was robbed of his wife, it was a great loss to both Abraham and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Isaac was a dear son to his mother, and she undoubtedly loved him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the age of thirty-seven, he was still unmarried and lived with his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he did marry at the age of forty 25:20 , the Bible even tells us that Isaac was married in his mother's tent 24:67 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suddenly, the love between Abraham and Sarah and between Sarah and Isaac was broken, for Sarah, the wife and mother, was taken away by an abnormal death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of this, Abraham suffered greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you read Abraham's history, you will see that God was always taking things away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Lot separated from him, Eliezer was rejected, Ishmael was cast out, and Isaac was offered to God on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then his dear wife was taken away in death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What trials and sufferings Abraham passed through!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to our natural concept, Abraham, one who was so good with God, should not have suffered all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapter twenty-two Isaac was offered to God and returned to Abraham in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suddenly, while Abraham was enjoying a happy life with his wife Sarah and his son Isaac, Sarah, the factor of his happiness, was taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The happiness in this family was dependent upon Sarah, the wife and the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Sarah died, the atmosphere, life, and happiness of this family were all taken away, and the family itself was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a suffering that was to Abraham!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As God's called ones, we should not expect to have a happy life here on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must follow the steps of Abraham looking for a better country, for a city with foundations Heb 11:10, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our temporary life on earth is the life of a traveler.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Due to this, Abraham paid little attention to his dwelling place and simply erected a tent.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was a sojourner, a stranger, who was looking for a permanent dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Abraham lived for thirty-eight years without Sarah's help 25:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Bible, the number thirty-eight is the number of sufferings, trials, and tests.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The children of Israel suffered trials and tests in the wilderness for a period of thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we have seen, Isaac was forty years old when he married.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the Bible, the number forty also means trials, temptations, and tests.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We also have another number in this chapter four hundred which is ten times forty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first time the number four hundred is used in the Bible is in Genesis 15:13, where Abraham was told that his descendants would suffer affliction for four hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here in 23:16 we read that Abraham bought the sepulcher at the cost of four hundred shekels of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that it was a test, trial, and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As you read this chapter in the past, perhaps you did not have the feeling that Abraham was suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But notice two words in verse 2 "mourn" and "weep."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Abraham mourned and wept for Sarah because he had lost his happiness and his family life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Hebrew words translated "mourn" and "weep" indicate much more than just mourning and weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Abraham suffered intensely at losing his wife in his old age; he was deeply hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His great suffering is indicated by the numbers thirty-eight, forty, and four hundred.</S>
