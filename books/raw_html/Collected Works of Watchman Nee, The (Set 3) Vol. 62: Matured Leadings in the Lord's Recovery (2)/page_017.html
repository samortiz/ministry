<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE</h1><h1 class="title">(4)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Saturday evening, February 18, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong<br />Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</h1><p>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Lord, we thank and praise You for becoming flesh, living a life on the earth, bringing God's will, His work, and His word to the world, and showing us a clear way to go on. Lord, we confess that the church in Hong Kong is in a fallen state. We cannot hide from the shining of Your great light. But we thank and praise You. Through Your servants You have presented Your will and way before us. Grant us the grace and power to go on in the way that pleases You.</p><p>Lord, how we thank and praise You for giving the spiritual gifts and inheritance to the church throughout the past two thousand years. We also praise and thank You for revealing Your will and heart's desire to us through Your servants. You have put us in this closing period of the end time when Your coming is so imminent, and You have shown us such abundant light and such a clear way. May we not miss the opportunity. May all of us be willing and able to forsake everything to serve You as our Lord and our King. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE CHURCH<br />TO SUBDIVIDE INTO DISTRICTS</h2><p>Witness Lee: According to the Bible, a church should be local. The boundary of the locality is determined by the boundary of its civic administrative unit. The Bible shows us local churches, but it does not have churches on a street or churches in a district. The justification for starting a church is not based on its number of members. A local church may cover a large geographical area and may have a large number of people, but it is still one church. Of course, it is hard for a church that is large geographically or numerically to take care of the needs of every brother and sister. The church in Jerusalem began with three thousand and then five thousand saved ones. When Paul returned to Jerusalem to meet James, there were tens of thousands of believers in that city (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20). It is not an easy thing for a church of this size to carry out something or to meet the needs of every brother and sister. Therefore, there is the need to subdivide such a church into districts to facilitate the work and to reach and visit the saints easily. The districts are not the church, but they are almost like mini local churches; they fulfill many of the functions of a church. They have their own meetings, they cover many practical affairs, and they exercise care over all the brothers and sisters.</p>
