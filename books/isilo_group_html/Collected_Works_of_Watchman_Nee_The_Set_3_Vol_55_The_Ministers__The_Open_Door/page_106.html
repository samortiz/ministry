Later, the list was reduced to seventy. It was decided that there would only be twenty-three families with a total of seventy-three people, including adults and children. In the eleventh month of the last lunar calendar, we sold our goods and received forms permitting us to move. We asked Brother Feng to buy fields for us in Hufang. But as time went on, it became more and more difficult to sell our possessions, and the more we lowered the price, the less people wanted to buy them. The proceeds from selling our possessions was barely enough to cover our travel expenses. Nevertheless, our inward feeling pressed us more and more. If we worried about the future and calculated our budget, we would not be able to move. The brothers and sisters felt that they should go by faith because the migration was a move of faith anyway. Therefore, we prayed earnestly and asked the Lord to make arrangements. Later, it was easier to sell our possessions, but we did not get a very good price for them. Brother Feng sent us a letter telling us that he had bought fields in Hufang. We only had to wait for the moving permits.</p><p>Some of the brothers and sisters had even sold the huts in which they lived, but they were still waiting for the moving permits. The permits seemed to take forever, and we became a bit anxious. We fasted and prayed together in one accord for one morning, and the Lord revealed His word to a brother: "Fear ye not, stand still" (Exo. 14:13). We continued to pray earnestly with tears for our gospel migration. In the end, God's word came to us again, saying, "Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak thou unto the children of Israel, that they go forward" (v. 15). We knew that He did not want us to pray any longer, but instead wanted us to move forward. Three or four brothers prayed and asked, "How do we move forward?" We wanted to obtain moving permits and go in a proper way. That afternoon someone came to help us. During the night of March 9, we received our moving permits. The next day we made arrangements for the boat, the train, and our baggage. We left in the middle of the night on the third day, and we arrived safely in Yiyang at 2:00 in the afternoon the following day.</p><p>After arriving in Yiyang, we learned that the sale of the fields in Hufang was not consummated because they belonged to landed gentry. Thank the Lord that He wanted us to learn a new lesson. We wanted to buy fields in a place where the harvests were better and where we were closer to the city. How could we have guessed that He wanted us to wholly follow Him without relying on anything else and to wait for what He Himself had arranged? We were a large group, so we decided to go to the meeting hall at the First Farm to wait for God's arrangement.</p><p>We prayed and waited for ten days before going to Tungzhia, Yiyang, to see if there was any place there to start a farm. When the brothers returned, they felt that there was sufficient land to start a farm. After praying and consulting with Brother Feng, we decided to first buy more than twenty Chinese acres. We sent brothers and sisters, who could do preliminary work, to the edge of the fields to build three small houses that would shelter us from rain and provide places to sleep at night. We did not realize that the first half of the year is very rainy. There were not even three or four days of clear weather. While the rain was heavy, we were alone in the mountain wilderness without any neighbors. Our beds on the floor got wet from the ground, and the roof leaked. All we had was the Lord's presence. Sometimes we sat under umbrellas for the whole night. It was really a new lesson to learn. When the brothers saw our condition, they worked hard at their tasks: cutting grass, sawing lumber, and building wood houses. Through the encouragement of the Lord's love and by His grace, we built five large houses. We crowded all the brothers and sisters in together to save money. We continued buying fields, building houses, plowing the fields, and ordering more materials. Presently, we have a good beginning.</p><p>The director of the Farmers' Cooperative, the mayor of the village, and the county executive all examined our moving permits and expressed satisfaction that we had gone through the required procedures correctly and thoroughly. They asked us to tell them of our qualifications. We told them that we believed in Jesus and that we were just poor farmers. They said that they believed us, and granted us permission to remain in this mountain wilderness.</p><p>We have had meetings here for two Lord's Days. In the morning there is a gospel meeting and a prayer meeting. In the afternoon, there is a meeting in which we sing hymns, pray, and sometimes the brothers share something. As a result of our gospel, thirteen families have received the Lord; six of them have had some background in the gospel, while the other seven are brand new in the faith. The Lord Himself must continue working among the natives of Kiangsi.</p><p>The schedule at the farm is as follows: We rise at 5:00 for a prayer meeting. We eat breakfast at 6:00. After breakfast, everyone goes about his own work. Some go to Yiyang to buy rice and other goods. Others engage in carpentry, plowing, farming, or cattle raising. Others cut grass, carry wood, cook, or wash, etc. We eat lunch at 11:30 and dinner at 6:30.</p><p>Our budget has enough funds for another month or two. The brothers and sisters are doing their best to save money. We only eat dried vegetables, pickled rutabagas, and rice. We hope that by the Lord's grace this will be enough. Thank the Lord that the brothers' and sisters' appetites have increased for this kind of food. It has made us remember the word of the Scripture which says, "Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it/Than a house full of feasting with strife" (Prov. 17:1).</p><p>Regarding industrial production, we are presently very busy with our farming and do not have time for it. When we have time to plan for it, we will add this activity to our list.</p><p>For those who migrated to Tungzhia, Yiyang,<br />Chao Ji-tang, Nee Jia-li, Nee Lin-di<br />May 5, 1950</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_105.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_107.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministers & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 106</div><br></body></html>
