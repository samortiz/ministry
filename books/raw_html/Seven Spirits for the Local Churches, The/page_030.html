	 <h2 class="head1">HOW TO PARTICIPATE</h2>
<p>In the eyes of God everything has been accomplished. Then how can we participate in all of this? If we are going to participate and partake of all these things, we must realize the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Teachings and doctrines can never help us to partake. Religion and Christianity cannot help us to participate. Only the sevenfold intensified Spirit can work this out for us. At the very outset, this book speaks of the seven Spirits of God before His throne. This is the first means by which we can participate in all these victories. This is why we are so happy. Do not think that we do not have any problems. We do, but we do not care for all the problems. We are so happy because we realize the seven Spirits of God. This is the first thing.</p>
<p>Then the second is the local churches. If we are going to participate in all these victories, we must be in the local churches. The local churches are the places, the locations, and the means for us to realize all the victories of Christ and the church. There is no other place. I was in the denominations for years, and I never knew this book. I was taught so much about this book, but I never knew this book. This book was never opened to me because I was not on the right standing. But one day I came into the local church. Then this last book of the Bible became so transparently clear to me. It is by the seven Spirits, and it is in the local churches.</p>
<p>The third thing we must see to participate in all these things is the different Christ. In all these chapters, have you seen the different Christ? What is the difference? He is the burning One with seven eyes, and He is the Lion. In chapter 7 He is the other Angel who puts the seal of God upon God&rsquo;s people. In chapter 8 He is another Angel, who puts the incense into the prayers of the saints. Then in chapter 10 He is the strong Angel who comes down from heaven to take possession of the sea and the land. In chapter 14 He is the One like the Son of Man sitting on the cloud with the sickle to reap the harvest. In chapter 18 He is the Angel with great authority, illuminating the earth and crying strongly, &ldquo;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great!&rdquo; Besides all the other aspects we have seen in the previous chapters, there are also these five aspects in chapters 7, 8, 10, 14, and 18. Christ is such a Christ. In the book of Revelation, He is not a small Christ, a gentle Christ, a kind Christ, a patient Christ, or a suffering Christ. He is a different Christ.</p>
<p>In Christianity there are many messages about Christ being so patient, so suffering, and so silent. But the last book of the Bible tells us about a different Christ. He is no longer patient and suffering. Eventually, in chapter 19 He is the King of kings and Lord of lords. In Revelation Christ is so different, so bold, so fierce, so burning, and so living. We are not in the Epistles today. Today we are in the book of Revelation. We need to know this different Christ, this other Angel: Oh, the seven Spirits; oh, the local churches; and oh, the different Christ!</p>
<p>Then the fourth thing that we must see in order to participate is life. We all must know life. Revelation is a book of life. Do not pay attention to the forms, the regulations, the teachings, the doctrines, Christianity, and religion. No, we must pay our full attention to life. If we are in the seven Spirits, if we are in the local churches, and if we experience the different Christ, we will be so much in life. Day and night, morning and evening, all the time we will be praising and shouting for joy. Then we will have the victory. We will participate in all the victories by means of the seven Spirits, the local churches, the different Christ, life, and praising.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that He has led us to and stationed us in the local churches! Here we experience life through the sevenfold intensified Spirit and stand on the proper, unique ground of oneness for the unique expression of the Lord&rsquo;s Body. We share a different Christ. This is why we are beside ourselves. We just cannot help it. We must be so, because this Christ is so different, and the life is so abundant in the local churches. There is nothing left for us to do but praise Him and enjoy His victory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BE VICTORIOUS</h2>
<p>Today, if you were to ask me how to be victorious, I would tell you that there is no need for you to try to be victorious. Just say from deep within, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; and you will be so victorious. Just praise the Lord and realize that today is the day of the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Then you must be in the local church. You must realize that Christ is so living, so bold, and so burning within you as your life. &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do we say &ldquo;O Lord&rdquo;? It is because when we say &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; we touch the sevenfold Spirit. We say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to what? We say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the sevenfold Spirit, &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the local churches, and &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to the Christ so bold, so fierce, so burning, and so living. &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! O Lord, the sevenfold Spirit! O Lord, the local churches! O Lord, the Christ so bold, so living, so burning, and so rich!&rdquo; We are simply victorious this way. There is no need of trying or doing anything. Just say, &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; Just praise the Lord, and you will be victorious.</p>
<p>If you praise Him in this way for five or ten minutes, you will be over all and strengthened in your spirit. Why? It is because you contact the living Lord. It is not a religion, Christianity, a lot of doctrines, or a set of teachings, forms, or regulations. No. It is the living Christ, the present Christ, the instant Christ, and the up-to-date Christ.</p>
<p>It is simply by realizing the sevenfold Spirit, being in the local churches, and realizing that Christ is your life. Then start to praise: &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; Then everything will be under your feet, and you will enjoy the victory found in the book of Revelation.</p>
