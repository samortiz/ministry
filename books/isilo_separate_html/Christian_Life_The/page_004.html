Christ Being the Center of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>Christ is the center of the Godhead. The Godhead is the Divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;and Christ is the center of the Divine Trinity. As the center of the Divine Trinity, Christ expresses the Father and is realized as the Spirit (John 14:10-20).</P><P>What is it for Christ to express the Father and be realized as the Spirit? In the four Gospels, we see a wonderful person by the name of Jesus. He spoke the Father's word (John 14:10, 24) and did the Father's work (John 4:34; 17:4). He did whatever the Father did (John 5:19). John 14 shows that the Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father (vv. 7-11) and that the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son (vv. 17-20). Christ is the Son, and He is the Father (Isa. 9:6; John 14:8-9). He is also the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b). When He was in His earthly ministry, many knew that He was a Nazarene and the son of Mary. Yet He was also the embodiment of the Triune God. He was the Son who was with the Father (John 8:29; 16:32) and by the Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20; 12:28). He did everything with the Father and by the Spirit. He expressed God the Father, acted by the Spirit, and was eventually realized as the Spirit. In the Gospels, we can see the Father, Son, and Spirit in one person, Jesus. This is the One whom we need to live as our mysterious life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. This Christ Being the Life</H2><P>This Christ is the life, the unique life, and no other life is the real life (John 14:6a). The Christ who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is the life.</P><P>At the end of Matthew, the Lord charged the disciples to go and baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (28:19). But in the Acts and the Epistles we cannot find this saying again. Acts says that they baptized people into the name of the Lord Jesus (8:16; 19:5), and Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 speak of being baptized into Christ. This shows that Jesus Christ is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. To baptize people into the name of the Lord Jesus and into Christ equals and is to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Therefore, Jesus Christ is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><P>A person's full name is actually composed of three names&#151;the first name, the middle name, and the last name. This is following the pattern of the Triune God. One God has three titles&#151;God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. As the embodiment of the Triune God, Christ is the life, the unique life. No other life is the real life (1 Tim. 6:19b).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
