<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Being Blessed in Their<br>Coming In and in Their Going Out</H2><P>According to verse 6, the people would be blessed in their coming in and in their going out.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Being Blessed in Their Storehouses,<br>in All Their Undertakings,<br>and in the God-given Land</H2><P>The children of Israel would be blessed also in their storehouses, in all their undertakings, and in the God-given land (v. 8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Jehovah Striking Down Their Enemies</H2><P>In verse 7 Jehovah said that He would strike down their enemies. The enemies would come out against them on one road, but the enemies would flee before them on seven roads.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Jehovah Establishing<br>Them as a Holy People to Himself</H2><P>If the children of Israel would keep the commandments of Jehovah their God and walk in His ways, He would establish them as a holy people to Himself (v. 9). Furthermore, all the peoples of the earth would see that they were called by Jehovah's name and would be afraid of them (v. 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Jehovah Giving Them Rain<br>for Their Land in Its Season</H2><P>Jehovah would give rain to His people for their land in its season (v. 12a). Because of their wealth, they would lend to many nations, but they would not borrow (v. 12b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Jehovah Making Them the Head<br>and Not the Tail</H2><P>Jehovah would make His people the head and not the tail, and they would tend only upward and not downward, if they would listen to the commandments of Jehovah their God (v. 13). They were not to turn aside from His words to go after other gods to serve them (v. 14). Moses was very concerned that they might turn aside to other gods, to idols, and, in Deuteronomy, he repeatedly warned them not to do this.</P>
