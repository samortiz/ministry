We thank You that You have shown us Your way, Your eternal economy, and even Your present recovery. We trust in You. We have no trust in ourselves. We need to follow You to carry out Your economy. We have nothing, and we can do nothing apart from You. So, Lord, we come to You this morning. Lord, we come to You with a seeking heart and an open spirit. Lord, You know by Your mercy and through Your grace that we love You. We believe that this love is out of You, toward You, and for You. Lord, we ask You to show us Your present way. This morning we are waiting on You, seeking to know Your mind, Your way, and Your arrangement. Even, Lord, we would know Your present economy among us. Lord, we are here open to You. We like to hear Your word and know Your heart. Lord, show us the way. Lord, we pray for our future. It is Your future for Your economy. Lord, after this term what shall we do? How would You want us to go on? Lord, You know everything. You know the present, and especially, You know the future. We have no knowledge at all about the future. Even we do not know the things of tomorrow. We do not like to live in tomorrow. We like to live in today. This morning we present ourselves again on Your altar, waiting for Your instructions. Lord, show us the way that You want each one of us to take. We pray for all of the dear trainees. We thank You for all of them. You have sanctified them and separated them unto Yourself. Lord, cover them all this morning. We like to see Your countenance and come into Your presence face to face. Lord, point out to us at this present time what You want us to receive and what You want us to fellowship. Lord, give us a clear sky and an open heaven. We open to You and to one another. We believe that You are opening Yourself to us all the time. Lord, bless Your testimony. Bless Your recovery. Bless the present steps of Your going on. Lord, we believe that this is of You. We are all in Your hand, on Your heart, and under Your care. Lord, do remember us. Remember us before the enemy. We cannot let him go. We like to accuse him before Your throne. Touching the throne, we would ask You, Lord, to defeat him and rebuke him. Put him to the corner. Even, Lord, crush him under our feet. Lord, give us the proper feeling. Amen.</P><P>The first thing that I would fellowship this morning is that due to my absence for a few weeks, I do have an accumulation within me to pass on. Second, we have only four weeks remaining before the close of this term. A number of us have been here for two terms. According to our present way of carrying on the training, we would like to have altogether two terms for each trainee. After the first and second terms, we will repeat the training again. Our training lasts only one year with two terms. For those who are available, we would like to have a second year mainly for us to practice. However, our practice will still be under the training. So, the first year of training will consist mainly of classes. The second year will consist of practice. However, this does not mean that during the first year there will be no practice. We will still have practice. We will hold classes in the morning and some in the afternoon. Then in the evening we will go out to practice. In the afternoon there will be the need to study some of the lessons. This will be our schedule for the two terms of the first year. Then the second year will be entirely for practice. Of course, some of us will not be available for the entire two years. Even though we may be available for only one year, that is still very good. Some may receive training for only the first year and then return to their locality. However, if they could spend another year in the training, that would be the best.</P><P>Every year we will have two terms. We will always begin our training in the fall, not in the spring, because the first year of the training began last fall. In the fall of this year, we will start the second year. Accordingly, we will have two groups of teachers. One group will serve with the trainees who start in the fall. Another group of teachers will train those who attend the spring term.</P><P>Concerning the present need of the trainees, it appears that there are more of you here who have been with us for two terms than of those who have been here for only this term. All of those who have been here for the last two terms are, no doubt, considering what they should do and where they should go. Those who have been here for only one term should stay with us for another term.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Instruction and Exhortation to the Trainees &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
