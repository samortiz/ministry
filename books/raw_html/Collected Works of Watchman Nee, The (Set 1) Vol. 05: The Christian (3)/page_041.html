<P>We have to remember that our unwillingness is often the thing that prevents us from keeping the word of Christ. Many times we are different from other saints in some things. We may think that it is a question of opinion and interpretation. Actually, the hidden reason buried beneath all this is our unwilling and unconcerned predisposition. Only those who will "to do His will" in principle will "know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God" in reality (John 7:17). Man's argument is necessarily of man. The Holy Spirit can never lead man into so many arguments. Although we see many things contrary to the word of God even among the most godly men, this is not our license to disobedience. This only tells us that man at his best is but this way and that the flesh is not to be followed. If we have been absolute in following the Lord, who can say that He has not led us to a proper and unique path? However, how many are there who are absolute in following the Lord?</P><P>We can see that many believers, up to a certain point, will proceed no further! Who can calculate their loss? Many believers try to recover this loss or to replace that which was lost by laboring for the Lord. They act as if the Bible says that to obey is not better than sacrifice, and to hearken not better than the fat of the rams (cf. 1 Sam. 15:22). There may still be the activities, but those who know God realize that the fellowship with God has stopped. What a pity that such a one can no longer be a companion. Although the feet may still be walking on the same path, when the fellowship with Christ is lost, nothing can replace it.</P><P>"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word" (John 14:23). The meaning of keeping the word is to allow the word of God to control, rule, and sustain us. It is for us to hide God's word in our hearts and to obey it. Because the believers in Philadelphia treasured the Lord's word and submitted to and obeyed it absolutely, the Lord gained the proper place. How wonderful it is when the whole congregation keeps the word of the Lord! They keep the Lord's word because of love, and they fellowship with Him because of this keeping. This is vastly different from the church in Ephesus. In everything outward, the church in Ephesus takes precedence. It lacks love, yet it is full of works. Philadelphia is short in everything outward. It lacks works, yet it is full of love. This is the reason that the Lord has pleasure in it. The Lord desires to see the love of His children more than their works and conduct. Of course, when there is love, there should also be the "labor of love," as found among the Thessalonians. However, the Lord cares for the motive of His people rather than their works. Hence, on the one hand, we see the great works of Ephesus devalued because of her lack of love; on the other hand, we see the small works of Philadelphia commended because of her love. Only among the latter does the Lord unveil Himself as the One who co-labors with them. As such, the open door is theirs.</P><P>"And have not denied My name." The Lord's word signifies the Lord Himself. Even the Father is manifested through this word. He came to the world to reveal God. No one can do this except the only Begotten who is in the bosom of the Father. The Lord's name hints at the fact that He Himself is no longer here but has ascended into glory. There is nothing better than to consider this Lord, to consider how He has revealed God, and to consider how perfect, precious, and holy He is. Although He Himself is no longer with us, when the saints confess His name, He is here. Whatever our words and conduct may be, the most crucial question is: do they express Christ? Anything that falls short of this is a denial of His name. Our self-centered life and our preference for sectarianism are all denials of this name. If we do not deny ourselves, we will deny the Lord's name.</P><P>The necessary condition for confessing the Lord's name is that we deny ourselves. We may be as self-confident as Peter was, who considered that he would not waver in the face of death, that he would follow the Lord, and that although others may stumble, he himself would never be as weak. It is this self-trust and self-confidence that prevented him from preparing himself for the coming trial by being watchful and by praying in the garden of Gethsemane. His oversight was the result of his self-confidence. But what was the end of Peter's fall? He denied the Lord's name. We must never be too careless or too self-confident, thinking that we "can" and we are "able." We must know that we are absolutely untrustworthy. Through a self realization of our weaknesses, we must come trembling and helpless to the Lord, pray by watching, seek His face, and trust in His strength. Only then will we not deny His name. No matter how confident we are in ourselves, this confidence will be our reason for failure. If we think that we can stand firm and are stronger than others, we will surely fail. We should remove all trust in our flesh because the flesh and the Lord are incompatible with one another.</P><P>The name of Christ signifies what Christ is. It signifies His own person, work, and authority. "They shall call His name `Emmanuel' (which is translated, God with us)" (Matt. 1:23). Because He wants to bring God to us, He came to be "Jesus," "Jehovah our Savior," because our salvation must come, before God can be with us. For this reason, He also has become "Christ," the anointed One, to carry out the ministry of the Mediator, bringing us to God and bringing God to us.</P>
