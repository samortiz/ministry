<h2 class="head1">GOD HAVING MERCY ON WHOM HE WILLS<br />AND HARDENING WHOM HE WILLS</h2><p>I will give you a little testimony. The first time I touched something concerning authority was when I read Romans 9. This chapter is hard to handle. In this chapter Paul showed how the Gentiles were called by God. First he spoke of Jacob and Esau, and then he spoke of Pharaoh as a negative example. It seems as if God was not fair in these instances. In man's eyes Jacob was naughty while Esau was honest, yet God loved the wicked Jacob and hated the honest Esau (v. 13). Paul posed the question: "Is there unrighteousness with God?", and his answer was, "Absolutely not!" (v. 14). It was as if Paul was saying, "God can do whatever He wants." If God wants to love Jacob, He can love Jacob. If He wants to hate Esau, He can hate Esau. The human mind may argue about God's treatment of Esau and find God unfair, yet God said to Pharaoh, "For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth" (v. 17). Was God unfair in hardening Pharaoh? We have to realize that God sits on His throne of glory, and man is under His authority. We mortals, who are feeble as dust, have no basis to reason with Him. When I first read the Bible and came to the passage in Exodus where it says that God hardened Pharaoh, I was very surprised. God shows mercy and grace. But He also hardens men. God is the One who does everything. This is amazing. In effect, Paul was saying, "How about this for a reason? Is this not a good enough reason?" If this reason is good enough, we are stripped of all arguments for Esau and Pharaoh.</p><p>Some may ask, "Why does He still find fault? For who withstands His will?" (v. 19). In my youth, when I came across this passage, I said to myself, "I admire anyone who can understand and believe this chapter." When I came to this passage, I thought that it was impossible for Paul to present a perfect argument. I was actually worrying and sweating for him at this point. Yet I noticed that Paul did not get into any argument at all. On the contrary, he simply asked, "O man, who are you who answer back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?" (v. 20). Paul did not respond with an argument. Rather, he asked, "Who are you?" It is not a matter of arguments and reasons but a matter of, "Who are you who answers back to God?" God is the God of glory, the One who sits on the throne. We are simply footstools before His throne; our place is only to obey. We must humble ourselves before Him. We have no right to argue with Him. We cannot have a round-table meeting with Him. Rather, we should prostrate in the dust before His feet. God does not have to consult us before doing anything. He does not need our consent. Only those who are equal with God can argue with Him. Are we equal with God? Men try to exalt themselves to be equal with God, but Christ humbled Himself. He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, becoming obedient (Phil. 2:6-8). How can we consider ourselves equal with God? Paul did not bother to give an answer; he did not try to furnish a reason. Instead he asked, "Who are you? How dare you say such a thing to God?"</p><p>When Paul fell on his way to Damascus, he only asked, "What shall I do, Lord?" (Acts 22:10). Once a man is enlightened, he can only say, "Lord, what do You want me to do?" He has no heart to reason anymore. A servant of God must not reason; he must cast off reason from him. A man must not live in reason, but under God's authority. What can the creatures say to the Creator? Romans 9 tells us only one thing&mdash;authority. He is God; He will have mercy on whom He wills, and He will harden whom He wills (v. 18). We have nothing to say. When God says He loves Jacob, that is whom He wills to love. When He says that He hates Esau, that is whom He wills to hate. When He says that He will harden a certain man, He wills to harden that man. God acts according to His authority and nothing else; He does not act according to reasons.</p><p>We have to know God's acts, not according to reason but according to authority. Throughout history no one who truly has known God has been ignorant of His authority. We cannot reason with God, because He is the Creator. He sits on the throne, while our place is in the dust. It is beyond our grasp to even try to be His footstool. We dare not look up to His face of glory; we can only look at His feet. In order to know God, we can only take the way of submission, not the way of reason. Unless reason is fully purged from us, we cannot know God. I must strongly repeat: Those who have not been fully delivered from reason can expect little perfecting from God. They are limited in capacity and usefulness. If we desire to obtain mercy from God and to participate in His work, we have to drive away all our reasons. In God there is only command and authority. Our place before God is simply obedience and obedience alone.</p><p>We all admire the measure of life which Madame Guyon had. We cannot find her arguing with God even once. She never reasoned with God. Authority is diametrically opposed to reason. We read in God's Word that He loved Jacob and hated Esau and that He shows mercy to whom He wills and hardens whom He wills. If we are truly enlightened by this word, all our reasons will be gone. We serve God because He is God. He does not reason with us. The One we serve is God. When God says something, it is done. He is sovereign over everything; He is the highest. His glory is unmatched in every way; it is beyond man's reach. Once we reason with God, there is no more worship. Once obedience disappears, worship disappears also. Man's reason cannot stand before God. God never argues with man. He only asks, "Who are you?" Once we prostrate ourselves in the dust, all desire for reasoning goes away. We have nothing to say before God. The only thing we can do is to stand in obedience.</p>
