   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXTERNALITIES DO NOT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOVERN DECISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The greatest error among God's children is that many people determine right and wrong by what they see.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people determine right and wrong according to their backgrounds and based upon their years of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, they do not know what is really right and what is really wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please remember that Christian living is based upon the inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people only have externalities before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many people decide what is right or wrong according to outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Life, however, is a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those with life know what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope we all would see this before God: No Christian can determine anything apart from life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever increases the inner life is right, and whatever decreases the inner life is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one should determine whether a matter is right or wrong by some outward standard.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I recall going to a certain place where the brothers were working with real effect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God was truly using them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you were to ask me whether or not their work was perfect, I would have to say that there was room for improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In great humility they asked me to point out anything I saw that could be corrected, so I pointed out this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They asked me several times, but they did not change anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Was I annoyed?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A foolish person would become annoyed, but one who knows God could not be upset.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I could only indicate external matters that needed adjustment, but I could not see what God was doing within them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I had no way to tell God what He should do within them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In another place I visited, the brothers were not preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They discussed the matter with me and asked if I thought that they should be doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I answered, "Doctrinally speaking, we certainly should preach the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They said they realized this as well, but that surprisingly God did not give them the life to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who know God can only stand aside in silence, for our pathway is His life, not right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The difference between these two principles is immense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, the contrast here is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So many people only think whether it is right or wrong for them to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But today we should not act according to what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The one question we must ask today is whether the divine life within us rises or falls.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what must determine the path we take.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything is decided in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"HEAR HIM"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the Mount of Transfiguration, Moses was present, representing the outward, moral standard, and Elijah was present, representing the outward, human standard Matt 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all know that Moses stands for the law, and Elijah stands for the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The standard of the law was present, and the standard of the prophets was present.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Old Testament the law and the prophets were most qualified to speak, but God silenced them here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God told Peter, "This is My Son, the Beloved...Hear Him!" v. 5 . Today the standard for Christian living is no longer the law, nor is it the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The standard for Christian living is now Christ Himself; it is the indwelling Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, it is not a question of whether we are right or wrong but of whether or not the divine life in us agrees with something.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Often, to our surprise, we find that the life within us disapproves of what we approve.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When this happens, we cannot insist on what we think is right.</S>
