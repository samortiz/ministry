<P>It is hard to make a distinction between an apostle and a prophet. It is also hard to draw a line between the prophets and the teachers. The teachers are very close to the prophets because they both teach. According to 1 Timothy 3:2, the elders must be those who are apt to teach. Furthermore, according to 1 Timothy 5:17, some of the elders should be those who labor in word and teaching. Thus, the prophets, the teachers, and the elders all teach. It is not so easy to distinguish these persons. We have to admit, however, that throughout the past centuries of church history, the church has had the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</P><P>In the early days of the Lord's recovery in China, Brother Watchman Nee was greatly influenced by Brethren teachings. He greatly admired John Nelson Darby. When I went to Shanghai to visit him in 1933, he gave me Darby's synopsis of the entire Bible. I received much help from those volumes. In 1933 Brother Nee was invited by the Brethren to visit them in Europe, England, and Canada. During that trip he saw the real situation among them. He realized that we could not follow the Brethren in an absolute way because of their serious mistake in the practice of the church life. At that time he began to study the Bible to see the proper practice of the church life. The light that he received during that time is in the book entitled The Assembly Life. Because he was influenced by Darby's teaching regarding the apostles, however, he said that we dare not say that we are the apostles today. Actually, some brothers among us at that time were like the apostles, so he was forced to say that we were the "unofficial apostles," while brothers such as Paul, Peter, and John were official apostles. Darby also taught that there were no longer any elders in the church. The Brethren assemblies have "responsible brothers," not elders. Eventually, I considered this matter, and I realized that many brothers are responsible brothers. Everyone who functions is a responsible person. Based on Darby's concept concerning apostles and elders, Brother Nee said in The Assembly Life that the unofficial apostles have the unofficial right to establish and appoint the unofficial elders. At Brother Nee's request, I wrote a long preface to this four chapter book that was published in 1934.</P><P>Within the next three years, Brother Nee saw more light. In 1937 he became bold to say, "If we are not the apostles, who are?" Since the gospel was preached in many pagan regions, churches were established, and elders were appointed, how could there not be apostles? From that time he began to say that we were the official apostles and that the elders established by us were official elders. This light concerning the apostles is in his book The Normal Christian Church Life.</P><P>Throughout the history of the church in these past nineteen centuries, some of God's people were in the category of the gifted ones mentioned in Ephesians 4&#151;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Even today, although Christianity has become so degraded, these kinds of persons are on the earth. These categories of gifted persons are given by the Head and used by the Head to perfect the saints. The Head does not build the Body directly, but the Head gives the gifts. The gifts also do not build the Body directly. Instead, they perfect all the saints, and the saints do the direct building work.</P>
