   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MY SPIRIT HAS REJOICED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Luke 1:46-47 Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord" present tense , and "my spirit hath rejoiced" perfect tense , "in God my Saviour."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, my spirit rejoiced in God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Second, my soul magnifies Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit comes first, then the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The spirit has rejoiced in God, then the soul magnifies the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are two things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To rejoice in God is to fellowship with God in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To magnify the Lord is to express the Lord with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to fellowship with the Lord in our spirit, and we have to express the Lord in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, we fellowship with Him; then we express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First we rejoice in Him; then we magnify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We rejoice in Him in our spirit, and we magnify Him with our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two organs are for two kinds of uses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are going to contact the Lord, you have to use your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are going to express the Lord, you have to use your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My spirit rejoiced in God, and my soul magnifies the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>PURIFIED IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second Corinthians 7:1 says to purify yourselves from all filthiness, both in the flesh and in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You have the flesh, and you have the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In these two parts you have to be purified from all kinds of filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Surely this is not the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy Spirit does not need to be purified from any kind of filthiness, but our spirit does.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SPIRIT AND SOUL AND BODY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Thessalonians 5:23 is a verse we have to pay attention to and remember: "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Never consider that the spirit is the soul and the soul is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some Christian teachers say the spirit and the soul are just synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 they are not synonyms because there is the conjunction "and" "spirit and soul and body."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Two conjunctions join three things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The soul is different from the body and the spirit is also different from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God comes into our spirit and spreads from the spirit to the soul and eventually from the soul to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we will be wholly sanctified spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you say that the spirit is the same as the soul, then I would point you to the monkeys, the tigers, all the beasts, and all the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Job 12:10 refers to the soul of every living thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every living thing includes the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are a living thing and we also have a soul, but besides the soul we have something super, something higher the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are different from the animals because they have a soul, but they don't have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have something more, something super, something higher for us to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We were made in the image of God with such a super organ, the human spirit, to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>SOUL DIVIDED FROM SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hebrews 4:12 says our soul can be divided from our spirit, as the marrow from the joints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We know the joints are pieces of bones, and within these bones is the marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The marrow is contained and hidden in the bones, but is absolutely different from the bones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The bones are like the soul and the spirit is like the marrow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The spirit is hidden and contained in the soul, and the soul can be divided from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>IN ONE SPIRIT, WITH ONE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Philippians 1:27 says "stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together in the faith of the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To stand firm we need to be in one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To strive together for the preaching of the gospel, for the spreading of the kingdom of God, we need to be with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To stand we need to be in one spirit, but to spread the gospel we need to be of one thought, of one mind, of one opinion, of one concept.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That means we need to be with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>So in one spirit is one thing; with one soul is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally, we must see that the Lord Jesus as life comes into us, but into what part of us?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Nothing could be more clear or more definite.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord Jesus today is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ today is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Never forget that Christ is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Because Christ today is the life-giving Spirit, and we have an inner part, the human spirit, these two spirits just come together and mingle and become one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now we have a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is rather hard to say whether this is the Holy Spirit or the human spirit because the two spirits are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>So Romans 8:4 tells us to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What spirit is this?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should walk not only according to the Holy Spirit and not only according to the human spirit, but according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now the Holy Spirit and the human spirit are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Here on this earth, in this universe, there is a spot where Christ as the life-giving Spirit is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now we just walk according to this wonderful, mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we are going to know and experience and enjoy this life-giving Spirit, we have to know our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is why our human spirit is so strategic.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our human spirit is the center of our being and the unique organ for us to contact the Lord; in our spirit we can be one with the Lord.</S>
