OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 19, 22b-26, 31, 39a</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for Your sovereignty and for Your sovereign grace so that we could have this conference. Thank You, Lord, for Your presence. Thank You for Your cleansing blood which is so precious to us. Lord, we are still sinful. We take You as our sin offering and as our trespass offering. We treasure the blood that You shed on the cross as the reality of all the offerings. We believe that we are under the cleansing of Your precious blood. Thank You, Lord Jesus, that where the sprinkling of the blood is, there is the anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit. We trust in this anointing. Lord, anoint us and anoint all the attendants. We love You, Lord Jesus. Bless us all. Lord, we trust in Your blessing. We do not trust in what we can do or in what we have. We admit that we are nothing, that we have nothing, and that we can do nothing. We declare this to the entire universe. Lord, we humble ourselves to the dust, admitting that You are everything to us. Thank You, Lord. We believe that whenever we meet and come together into Your name, we are in You. Thank You for Your word. We worship You for Yourself, and for Your speaking. How we thank You for Your oracle. Even today on this earth You have an oracle where You can speak. Nothing can frustrate You from speaking. Thank You, Lord, that You are on the throne. How we worship You! We identify with You as the One on the throne. We are not speaking from the earth but from the heavens. Lord, thank You that we are the heavenly people. We like to be one with You in the heavens. Lord, confirm the fact that we are one spirit with You and that You are one spirit with us. Lord, speak in our speaking. Speak Yourself into all the attendants so that everyone who comes to this meeting will not return empty. You are the rich Lord, and You are rich to everyone who calls on Your name. O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! We love Your dear name, and we call on this dear name. Lord Jesus, thank You again. We like to call upon Your name and thank You a thousand times a day. Hallelujah! Jesus is Lord! The victory is Yours, Lord! We declare Your victory by the cross over the enemy. No flesh is here. No hatred is here. We have the Spirit and the love of God. Amen.</p>
<p>The fellowship in this book is a continuation of the fellowship in recent books concerning the Body of Christ as an organism and concerning the building up of the Body of Christ organically (see <em>The Body of Christ, The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity,</em> and <em>The Building Up of the Body of Christ</em> published by Living Stream Ministry). Since I began to speak on this subject, the light has come continually. This is why I have entitled this book <em>Further Light concerning the Building Up of the Body of Christ.</em> Some of this further light is in 1 Corinthians. The Lord showed me the very striking, central, and crucial point of this book. The crucial point of this book is speaking for the Lord in chapter fourteen. Chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians is the issue of the entire book. It is wrong to think that only a pastor, a minister, or even a leading brother can speak for the Lord. All of the saints can speak for the Lord. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:31 that we all can prophesy, that is, speak for the Lord, one by one. As long as you are a saved believer, you must be a speaker that speaks the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEFINITION OF PROPHESYING<br />
IN 1 CORINTHIANS 14</h2>
<p>Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not predicting but speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others, ministering (dispensing) the Lord to others. What a precious and valuable thing it is to minister, to dispense, Christ into others. We need to learn to speak Christ, dispensing Him into others. This is proven by the words &ldquo;for building up,&rdquo; &ldquo;encouragement,&rdquo; and &ldquo;consolation&rdquo; in verse 3; by the words &ldquo;convicted&rdquo; and &ldquo;judged&rdquo; in verse 24; and by the words &ldquo;all may learn&rdquo; and &ldquo;all be encouraged&rdquo; in verse 31. Speaking the Lord into people builds them up, encourages them, and consoles them. When we speak for the Lord, others are convicted and judged. The fact that all may learn and all be encouraged also shows that this is not predicting but speaking for the Lord. Speaking the Lord forth into others enables them to learn something and be encouraged.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING PRODUCED BY ENJOYING CHRIST</h2>
<p>First Corinthians reveals the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ. We need to enjoy Christ every day according to what is revealed of Him in 1 Corinthians. Christ is our portion in His fellowship (1:2b, 9). He is theirs and He is ours. We have been called into His fellowship, which means that we have been called into the full enjoyment of Him. Christ is God&rsquo;s wisdom and power (1:24). Christ is our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, transmitted to us from God (1:30). He is righteousness for our past, sanctification for our present, and redemption for our future. He is also our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption in our daily life for us to be right, to be holy and sanctified, and to be rescued from many fleshly things. We can enjoy Christ as our Passover, taking care of our past, and as our unleavened bread, taking care of our present, so that we can live an unleavened life today (5:7-8). Day by day we need to keep the feast of unleavened bread. Christ is also our spiritual food and spiritual drink (10:3-4; 12:13b). He has given Himself to us so that we can participate in His body and blood for our enjoyment (10:16-17). We can enjoy Christ as the life-giving Spirit (15:45b) since we have been joined to the Lord as one spirit (6:17). First Corinthians reveals that we need to enjoy Christ as everything.</p>
<p>What we enjoy will have an issue. The enjoyment of Christ firstly issues in the growth in life to produce materials for the building up of the church (3:6, 9-14). The precious materials produced from the growth in life are signified by gold, silver, and precious stones. Our hope is that all of us will be transformed into the precious materials for God&rsquo;s building by enjoying Christ. First Corinthians 12 tells us that Christ is drinkable. Today we are drinking of Him, the one Spirit. He is our spiritual drink and our spiritual food. We need to be the enjoying people who enjoy Christ all day long and every day. This enjoyment spontaneously issues in the growth in life. We grow in life by enjoying Him, that is, by eating Him and drinking Him, partaking of Him.</p>
<p>All of us are growing. Even as an older Christian, I still have the feeling and the deep sensation that I am growing. Our enjoyment of Christ results in the growth in life. Some saints who are concerned for me may think that because I am old, I should retire and not labor anymore. But because I am growing in life, I am living and stronger than ever. I will endeavor to labor and struggle for the Lord&rsquo;s interest until I see the Lord in rapture or I die. Because I am growing, I am not becoming old. I am becoming younger because my inward man is being renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16). As we enjoy Christ, we grow in life to produce precious materials for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of Christ also issues in the development of gifts for functioning to build up the Body of Christ, prophesying being the excelling gift (1 Cor. 14:1, 12, 39a). To build up anything you need firstly the materials and secondly the skill, the functioning. Thus, the enjoyment of Christ issues not only in the growth in life but also in the development of gifts for functioning. This development is covered in chapters twelve through fourteen of 1 Corinthians. In these three chapters, Paul gives a clear view of the development of spiritual gifts for functioning to build up the Body of Christ. Dispensing Christ by speaking Him, prophesying, is the top development of the gifts as an issue of enjoying Him. I can testify that I am still under development. All of us are growing and being developed. We are not being developed to speak in tongues or to perform miraculous things. We are being developed to prophesy, not in the sense of predicting but in the sense of speaking for the Lord.</p>
<p>God in His New Testament economy is after a building. Where is the building today among us? We need to forget everything and go on according to the desire of God&rsquo;s heart to build up the Body of Christ. First Corinthians is a book of enjoying Christ, but what is the reason for us to enjoy Christ, and what is the issue of enjoying Christ? The enjoyment of Christ is for our growth in life to produce precious materials for God&rsquo;s building. Our enjoyment of Christ is also for developing our gifts to speak for Christ to build up the Body of Christ organically. The unique need among us today is that we would learn to speak for the Lord. We must have something of the Lord to speak for the building up of the church. The top development of the gifts as an issue of the enjoyment of Christ is to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, to speak the Lord into people, ministering Christ, dispensing Christ, into people. When we are full of the enjoyment of Christ, we can share with others the Christ that we have enjoyed.</p>
<p>While I am speaking, I believe that the Lord is one spirit with me. Whenever I speak, I ask the Lord to speak in my speaking, vindicating the fact that I am one spirit with Him while I am speaking. We should try to speak Christ to others in this way every day. We should stop talking in a gossiping way or in a reasoning way. Paul tells us that we should do all things without murmuring or reasoning and that we need to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling because God is operating within us (Phil. 2:12-14). If we do not speak Christ but speak other things, we are offending the indwelling Christ. We have Christ living within us. I do not like to offend Him. I like to please Him. This is why I always exercise to speak Christ. What an enjoyment and what a joy it is to speak Christ!</p>
<p>As we enjoy Christ, spontaneously we are growing in life to produce ourselves as precious materials and to develop what we have received from the Head as a gift. Little children receive certain talents by birth, but they need the development of these talents. These talents are developed by the children being fed. A child&rsquo;s eating helps him to grow, and his growth develops his function. First Corinthians tells us that the top development and the top function for the building up of the Body of Christ is speaking for the Lord, prophesying. We need to prophesy, not in the sense of predicting but in the sense of speaking Christ in an exhibiting way. Let us come to the meeting to exhibit Christ. We need to enjoy Christ that we may be developed in our spiritual function to speak the Christ that we have enjoyed and experienced in order to exhibit Him in the meeting for the building up of the Body organically. This is further light that I did not see in the past. I saw that the enjoyment of Christ issues in our growth in life. But I did not see so clearly that the enjoyment of Christ also issues in our being developed in our gift and function.</p>
<p>I have been speaking in the United States for over twenty-five years. I believe that some of the saints can realize that my functioning is increasing. My functioning in the past was not as strong as it is today. This shows that we all have to be developed. We should kneel down and pray: &ldquo;Lord, have mercy upon me that I may enjoy You today, that I may share in Your riches in a practical and subjective way so that I can have the growth in life and the development in function. I like to speak You, Lord, but I need the word. I need the utterance. I need Your thought. Lord, infuse me thoroughly and fill me with Your intention, with Your feeling, with Your thought, with Your word, with Your utterance, and with Your instant expression.&rdquo; We need to endeavor to be a useful one in the building up of the Body of Christ. Our Father God is after a practical and living building up of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING ENCOURAGED BY THE APOSTLE</h2>
<p>We can see from the following verses in 1 Corinthians 14 that the apostle encouraged prophesying:</p>
<p class="indent1">&ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 1.</p>
<p class="indent1">&ldquo;I desire...rather that you may prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5.</p>
<p class="indent1">&ldquo;If all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all&rdquo;&mdash;v. 24.</p>
<p class="indent1">&ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged&rdquo;&mdash;v. 31.</p>
<p class="indent1">&ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy&rdquo;&mdash;v. 39.</p>
<p>In all these verses Paul is encouraging us to prophesy. He tells us that we need to desire earnestly to prophesy.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul indicated that speaking in tongues is not of great value. He strongly belittled the gift of tongues and exalted the gift of prophecy because his main concern was the church rather than the individual believers. Speaking in tongues, even if it is genuine and proper, only edifies the speaker himself, but prophesying builds up the church (v. 4). Paul did not say that speaking in tongues was wrong, but that the abuse and the exaggeration of it was wrong. He indicated to the saints in Corinth that they had to be limited in their speaking in tongues and increased in their speaking for the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord desires that we all would be those who prophesy for the building up of the church. In 1937 Brother Nee told us that to practice the meeting life according to the traditional way with one preacher speaking and the rest listening is not according to God&rsquo;s way. This fellowship is contained in the book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life,</em> published in English in 1939. In 1948 Brother Nee had a long term of training for four months. There were about eighty people under his training at that time. In that training he gave several series of messages. One series is published in the book entitled <em>Church Affairs.</em> In his fellowship contained in this book, Brother Nee became stronger. He encouraged us to stop the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting and go out to preach the gospel (pp. 71-72). He indicated that there was no need for us to keep the old way of one man speaking and the rest listening. He told us that the pressure of tradition is very strong and that we all need to push against it day after day until the traditional way is pushed out of the way. If everyone pushes, one day the traditional way of one man speaking and the rest listening will be pushed away (pp. 81-82).</p>
<p>When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I was seeking the Lord&rsquo;s leading that we could have a new start. I realized that all of Christianity, basically speaking, had come to a standstill. Most of the major denominations are decreasing in number. The ones who do have some increase, have very little increase. I realized that our situation was no different. We were very low in our percentage of increase. The result of my seeking the Lord since I returned to Taipei in 1984 is this&mdash;the Lord wants to have all the saints prophesying. The Lord does not want a Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting with one speaker and the rest listening. What the Lord wants is to have all the saints, including the sisters and all the young people, to speak for the Lord, to prophesy. We have seen all the verses in 1 Corinthians 14 in which the apostle encouraged us to prophesy. In verse 39 Paul told us to &ldquo;desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo; He was encouraging, teaching, and instructing us to prophesy. He told us that all of us can speak for the Lord, one by one (v. 31). The subject of 1 Corinthians 14 is the matter of speaking for the Lord. The apostle strongly encouraged the speaking of the Lord again and again.</p>
<p>Brother Nee saw this fifty years ago, but we never fully entered into the practice of it because we had no way. Brother Nee told us that we had nothing to replace the kind of meeting in which one person is speaking and the rest are listening. He also told us that this kind of meeting had become a deeply rooted habit. Even the unbelievers have such a concept. Their concept of Christian worship is to be gathered together under one man&rsquo;s speaking. Most unbelievers know that this is what it means to worship God in Christianity. Although they have not become Christians yet, the thought of one man speaking and the rest listening is already in them. It is hard for us to get out of this prevailing traditional thought and concept. When I went back to Taipei in 1984, I was really seeking the Lord so that He could have a new way among us in His recovery. Eventually the Lord showed me that His new way is for all His people to speak for Him. What the Lord wants is for each one of us to prophesy. My burden is to tell all the saints to learn to speak. I have a burden to go back to Taipei to teach the saints one by one to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>In order to speak for the Lord, we have to be revived every morning of every day. We have to rise up in the morning to be revived. After rising up in the morning, we have to spend some time with the Lord, enjoying Him through the Word. Surely we will gain something of the Lord. At the end of the week on Saturday evening, we may even write down or compose a little speaking to present in the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning for three minutes. They have begun to practice this way in Taipei, and they have experienced success. I have a burden to go back and to say more. I want to teach them how to speak for the Lord. I believe that all the churches need this. When we Christians come together to meet, there should be much speaking from all the saints. It is not scriptural for just one man to speak in a church meeting. Regardless of how rich, how capable, or how able a speaker is, his speaking in itself cannot be as rich as many people speaking the riches of Christ in many aspects and from different directions. If twenty out of fifty saints meeting together speak forth the Lord to exhibit the riches of Christ, that meeting will be a rich feast.</p>
<p>When I considered before the Lord how to help the saints to speak, the Lord charged me to get into Ephesians 4:11-16. Ephesians 4 tells us that Christ as the heavenly Head gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers to perfect the saints. These gifted ones not only feed the saints but also perfect them, equip them, furnish them, that the saints may do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ in an organic way. In the next three chapters, we will go on from Paul&rsquo;s burden in 1 Corinthians 14 to Ephesians 4. We may have never considered that the evangelists need to perfect the saints. Surely the evangelists need to preach the gospel to sinners. But they also need to perfect the saints, to edify the saints. In a proper university there are many professors teaching different courses. There are professors of mathematics, biology, physics, and history. In God&rsquo;s university, God has four kinds of professors&mdash;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers. All the saints should be educated, taught, instructed, perfected, equipped, and furnished by these professors. Then all the graduates from this university will be able to do the same thing that the professors do. This kind of education will spread if the saints are perfected by these four kinds of gifts. Everyone will be enabled to do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ. We are short of this kind of perfecting.</p>
<p>My burden in these days is to speak the truth revealed in 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4. In this matter of everyone being perfected to speak for the Lord and to speak the Lord into others, I want to be an &ldquo;alarm clock&rdquo; to wake up the saints. We need to wake up to speak Christ. We need to wake up to learn how to prophesy. For a person to play the piano he has to learn. One cannot buy a piano and simply begin to play it immediately without any instruction, perfecting, or learning. If one is going to play the piano in a proper way, he needs to practice for many years. Then he will be enabled to play a proper melody. For a person to learn how to play basketball, he has to practice over and over again. In like manner, we have to learn how to prophesy. However, we have not been instructed or perfected in this matter. Who is endeavoring to practice the truth revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16? At the end of my four years of study since returning to Taipei in 1984, the Lord has brought me to these two portions of the Word. I will speak on this until all of the saints in the meeting are speaking for Christ. We need speakings in the meetings of three or four minutes. We must practice this kind of speaking for the Lord. Some of the saints may feel that they cannot do this. This is why we have to learn and practice. We have to drop the traditional way, and rise up to learn to speak for Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">TO PROPHESY BEING TO EXCEL</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14:12 says that we have to seek to speak for the Lord by the excelling Holy Spirit&mdash;&ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits (lit.), seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&rdquo; If we seek to prophesy, our seeking will be excelling. Our seeking of the spiritual things will not be so low, but it will excel. Prophesying is sought by the seeking believers. The top function for the building up of the Body of Christ is to speak for the Lord. To prophesy is to excel because it is of the excelling Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Paul began 1 Corinthians 14:12 by saying, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits....&rdquo; J. N. Darby has a note on this portion of the Word that makes Paul&rsquo;s meaning clear. During Paul&rsquo;s time, the unbelieving Greeks were zealous of devilish spirits. After they became Christians, they needed to be zealous of the Holy Spirit. There are many devilish spirits plus the Holy Spirit. This is why Paul says that if you are zealous for spirits, you must be zealous for the excelling Spirit, that is, the Holy Spirit. The excelling Holy Spirit should be sought by the seeking believers. To speak for Christ, to speak Christ forth, to speak Christ into others, is to practice a function that excels. This is the highest function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING BEING FOR OTHERS&rsquo; LEARNING</h2>
<p>Prophesying is for others&rsquo; learning (14:31). For others to be able to learn by our prophesying, we have to learn something first. A teacher cannot teach unless he has learned something. If he has not learned something, how can his students learn something? When we prophesy for others&rsquo; learning, we speak not only by the inspiration of the Spirit in our spirit but also by our seeking and learning with the mind (14:19). We must learn how to speak. My secret in speaking is that whenever I speak I pray in this way: &ldquo;Lord, infuse me with Your intention, with Your feeling, and with Your thought. Lord, infuse me with Your word and Your expression. Infuse me, Lord, with Your instant utterance.&rdquo; The Lord is faithful to hear this prayer. We all have to learn to say something for the Lord. Then when we speak Christ to others, they will learn something. Speaking for the Lord is not a sudden or miraculous thing. To speak for the Lord we have to learn just as if we are studying in a college. We have to learn to speak, try to speak, desire to speak, and seek to speak since prophesying is excelling.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING FOR THE PRACTICAL<br />
BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Prophesying is for the practical building up of the church (14:3-5, 12, 26), the organic Body of Christ. Prophesying is not for the building up of a congregation, an organization. The way of one man speaking and the rest listening is the old way. The way of Christianity is to build a congregation, an organization, which is a facade. Everyone prophesying builds up a body&mdash;the Body of Christ, an organism. This organism can only be built up in the organic way by practicing 1 Corinthians 14:26 through the perfecting of the saints by the four gifts mentioned in Ephesians 4:11-16.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE APOSTLES&rsquo; AND THE PROPHETS&rsquo; PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-16</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this meeting. We worship You for Your speaking daily and hourly to all of us. Thank You, Lord, for the word, the printed Word and the spoken word. Thank You for the word that You have been speaking to us every day in Your Spirit and to our spirit. Lord, how much we need You. We need You desperately. Without You, we can do nothing. Apart from You, we are empty. Lord, be our health and strengthen us. We want to be strengthened in You. Speak to our heart, to our mind, to our spirit, and to our entire being. Lord, You make the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and send rain on the just and the unjust. You are the merciful God who loves everyone. Lord, we like to learn of You and be one with You in Your love. Thank You that we are one with You. Oh, what a salvation that we are one with the processed Triune God in His divine Trinity! Thank You, Lord Jesus. When we are in this organic union with You, You can be magnified, glorified, and testified. Lord, we thank You that we can speak You to one another. Lord, speak in our speaking, and give us an ear to hear what You are speaking. We cannot forget Your enemy. Lord Jesus, bind him. Lord, we give the commandment to bind Your enemy, Satan, the Devil. Chase him away from this meeting place. Chase away all the darkness and every cloudy situation. Lord, take away all the veils and clear up the entire situation. Speak a clear word to us. Speak a loving and precious word. We love You, Lord. O Lord Jesus! We love Your name. Oh, we love Jesus! We will love Your name for eternity. We love You today, and we love You at this very moment. We believe that You are with us and that You love us. How we worship You! You love us in Your divinity and Your humanity. Hallelujah! Jesus loves us! Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">1 CORINTHIANS 14&mdash;A CHAPTER OF ENCOURAGEMENT<br />
TO PROPHESY, TO SPEAK CHRIST</h2>
<p>In chapter one we saw that 1 Corinthians 14 is a chapter of encouragement from the Apostle Paul. In the first verse of this chapter Paul says, &ldquo;Desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Then near the end of the chapter in verse 39 Paul says, &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo; The whole chapter encourages us to seek after speaking for the Lord, prophesying. The entire New Testament consummates in this charge, the charge for us to prophesy. We should not forget that the proper meaning of prophesying in the New Testament is not just to predict, to foretell, but to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into people in a dispensing way. We should daily minister Christ into others by speaking Him. This matter of speaking the Lord is the top consummation of the entire New Testament in our functioning for the building up of the Body of Christ. Thank the Lord that we are under such an enlightenment.</p>
<p>I believe that the sky is clear to us and that the heaven is even opened to us. Lord Jesus, we are here and we open to You. We believe that You are opening Yourself to us. It is so good to be open to the Lord and to one another. When we meet together to enjoy the speaking of God in His oracle, the earth is connected to heaven, and the heaven is open to the earth. There is a heavenly ladder connecting the earth to heaven (John 1:51; Gen. 28:11-22). There is such a heavenly traffic when God speaks in His oracle in the meeting. When we receive His speaking, we are enlightened, nourished, strengthened, established, transformed, and built up. We are under the divine building up, not of a congregation for a facade but of an organism. This universal, unique organism is the Body of Christ. Christ is the Head and all His redeemed ones are the members of this Body. What a mercy that each one of us is a member of Christ! We are not members of organized Christianity, but we are members of Christ. We love Christ, but we hate any kind of &ldquo;anity.&rdquo; We love the living Christ, the Christ full of life, the organic Christ. We are His organic Body.</p>
<p>The new light that we are enjoying is that 1 Corinthians 14 is altogether an encouragement, encouraging us to prophesy, to speak the Lord and to speak for the Lord. We should exercise to speak Christ all the time. In our homes we should not speak anything but Christ. The husbands and wives should speak Christ to each other. Instead of exchanging words with each other, the husbands and wives should learn to speak Christ to each other. We should forget everything and cleave to Christ. Then in the church meetings, we should speak only Christ. Christ is everything. When we speak something from Hades, we are in Hades. When we speak something concerning Christ, we are in the heavens. Let us speak Christ again and again, a thousand times a day. It will not tire us to speak Christ. Hallelujah for Christ, and hallelujah even more for speaking Christ! I can never exhaust the speaking of Christ. Thank the Lord for Paul&rsquo;s encouragement in 1 Corinthians 14 for us to speak Christ.</p>
<p>In such an encouraging chapter, Paul tells us in verse 26 that whenever we come together, we should speak Christ. First, we speak Christ to ourselves, then to one another, then to the angels, and then to the Devil, Satan. We have to say, &ldquo;Satan, I am going to speak Christ to you to defeat you and to chase you away.&rdquo; The strong light shining from 1 Corinthians 14 is for us to speak Christ. We must come together to speak nothing but Christ. We must speak Christ, Christ, Christ, and more Christ. I am perfecting the saints to speak Christ. We all need to say, &ldquo;Amen! I like to be perfected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of 1 Corinthians 14 is a charge for us to desire earnestly to prophesy. We are to pursue not only love but also prophesying. We must seek to excel to the building up of the church by seeking to prophesy. We should not seek after the low gifts, but we must seek the excelling gift of prophesying. We all need to excel by speaking forth Christ. Christ is all and in all. Christ is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God. Your Christ and my Christ, the very Christ who lives in us and who indwells us, is the life-giving Spirit. Is this not excelling? We have so much to speak of Christ.</p>
<p>The best way to preach the gospel to sinners is to speak Christ to them. In our gospel preaching we may say something like this: &ldquo;Dear friends, I have something excelling to share with you, and this excelling thing is a living person, Jesus Christ. I must tell you that you are empty. Why are you empty? Because you are short of Christ. You need Christ. Christ is the living One. Christ is all and in all. Christ is God. Christ is man. Christ is the Spirit. Christ is love. Christ is light. Christ is righteousness. Christ is sanctification. Christ is redemption. Christ is our salvation. Christ is our today. Christ is our present. Christ is our future. Christ is our eternity. Christ is everything. You need Him, and you can have Him right now. Follow me to pray and call on His name. Just say, &lsquo;O Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus, I love You and I embrace You.&rsquo;&rdquo; This is the excelling way to preach the gospel. This is more excelling than telling people that if they do not believe in the Lord, they will go to hell. The excelling preaching is to preach Christ as everything in all His unsearchable riches. We need to be perfected to speak Christ in this way. All of us need such perfecting.</p>
<p>The Lord desires to build up the church as an organism, the Body of Christ. There is not such a thing on this earth today because hardly anyone cares for 1 Corinthians 14:26. Whenever we come together in a church meeting, regardless of how big or how small it is, we must have something to present to the ones in that meeting. What we present must be Christ. Each attendant can present Christ in a different aspect. If everyone in the meeting only speaks concerning one aspect of Christ, the meeting will not be that rich. Jesus is all in all and He has many aspects. One person may say, &ldquo;Jesus is love.&rdquo; Another may say, &ldquo;Jesus is light.&rdquo; Someone else can say, &ldquo;Jesus is the embodiment of the Triune God,&rdquo; and another can add, &ldquo;Jesus is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God in His divine Trinity.&rdquo; Then someone can say, &ldquo;This very Jesus, who is the very embodiment of the processed Triune God, is now the indwelling Spirit.&rdquo; After that is said, another one can say, &ldquo;He is the consummation of God as the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our speaking we can exhibit the riches of Christ, all the aspects of His wonderful person. Suppose we had such a meeting in which everyone spoke nothing except Jesus in different aspects. In such a meeting, the heaven is opened. The leavened practice of Christianity is that only the pastor or certain gifted ones can speak. The Scriptures, however, tell us that when we all come together, each one has. What a meeting we could have if all the attendants would speak nothing but Jesus in the many aspects of His person! We could never exhaust speaking about His person in this way. He is the tree of life. The Scriptures also reveal that He is a bird. In His relationship with the nation of Israel, He is likened to an eagle (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11-12). He flew the entire nation of Israel out of Egypt. Actually, it was the Lord who flew me from Taiwan to the United States. My trust is in His wings. I trust in the living, organic wings of this great Jesus! This wonderful eagle is my bird. Christ is also my power. No power is stronger than Jesus. In His person He is everything.</p>
<p>We can never exhaust speaking about Jesus. We do not have time to talk about other things. Jesus is sufficient for us to talk about for eternity. We need to practice speaking Jesus in our meetings. Each of us should speak Christ in different aspects. If one person says that Christ is great, the other one can say that He is also small. If He were only great and not small, He would not be everything. We need to practice speaking Christ in our meetings so that 1 Corinthians 14:26 can be a reality among us.</p>
<p>Some may agree with the truth in 1 Corinthians 14:26, but they may not believe that it can be worked out. Some have advised me not to endeavor to bring in the scriptural way of meeting and serving to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They are concerned that this is too hard a task for me in my old age. The more that people talk to me in this way, however, the more I desire to speak on this subject. Nothing can stop me from telling people that 1 Corinthians 14:26 is workable. With us it may seem impossible, but with the Lord nothing is impossible. First Corinthians 14:26 is His word. His word must be fulfilled. In Matthew 24:35 the Lord said, &ldquo;The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.&rdquo; I believe that today is the time for us to labor with Him, to cooperate with Him, that He could have a channel to fulfill His word in 1 Corinthians 14:26. It would be good to have the following saying framed on our wall: <em>1 Corinthians 14:26 to be fulfilled definitely.</em> I am a human being with human feelings, and I am sympathetic to the loving advice from people who say that I should not labor and endeavor so much to see the scriptural way fulfilled. But in addition to my humanity I also have the Lord within me. This wonderful, divine One within me says that He will fulfill His word. I believe that 1 Corinthians 14:26 is the Lord&rsquo;s word and that it will be fulfilled. In my fellowship with the Lord, I was considering how 1 Corinthians 14:26 could be fulfilled. Then one day the answer came. It will be fulfilled by Ephesians 4:11-16. Ephesians 4:11-16 says that the Lord has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints so that the Body of Christ can be built up.</p><h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES&rsquo; PERFECTING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">By Visiting the Churches</h2>
<p>The apostles perfected the saints firstly by visiting the churches (Acts 15:36, 40-41). When Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, they had not been invited (Acts 14:21-22). Later Paul desired to return to these churches again and he said to Barnabas, &ldquo;Let us return now and visit the brothers throughout every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, and see how they are getting along&rdquo; (15:36). Because Paul was burdened to perfect the saints in these churches, he returned to visit them.</p>
<p>In Paul&rsquo;s talk with the elders in Ephesus in Acts 20, Paul said that he taught them &ldquo;publicly and from house to house&rdquo; (v. 20). To teach the saints publicly, no doubt, indicates that he taught them in a meeting. He also taught them from house to house. This phrase &ldquo;from house to house&rdquo; means according to houses. Paul spoke Christ to all the saints in their homes. He admonished the saints with tears even for as long as three years (v. 31). Our concept of an apostle may be that he is a good speaker who is eloquent, knowledgeable, and highly appraised and exalted. But here is an apostle in Acts 20 who visited the homes of the poor saints and admonished them with tears. An apostle should go to the saints&rsquo; homes, especially to the poor ones&rsquo; homes.</p>
<p>When I was with Brother Nee in Shanghai, I observed that he would not go to the homes of the rich saints. Many of these saints tried repeatedly to have Brother Nee in their homes, but he would not accept their invitations. However, whenever the poor saints invited him to their homes, he would immediately go. He told me directly and personally that it is a shame for us to respect the rich ones more than the poor ones. Dear saints, this is an apostle.</p>
<p>We need to read Acts 20 again to see what an apostle is and does. As Paul was on his way to Jerusalem, he stopped in Miletus and sent for the elders of Ephesus. He charged them, and he placed himself before them as an example. He told them that he labored to supply his needs and the needs of his co-workers (v. 34). In addition to all of his labor, he still visited the homes of the saints, from house to house. He did this to perfect the saints. He did not shrink from declaring to them anything that was profitable (v. 20), declaring to them all the counsel of God (v. 27). What a marvelous perfecting work the apostle Paul did!</p>
<p>Many may want to be an apostle, but who today is doing the kind of work that Paul did? I want to see all the saints perfected to be apostles. A little sister among us can be perfected to be an apostle sent by God to visit her relatives. We should go to visit others in order to bring Christ to them. As ones who are sent by God, we go to others with Christ. An apostle is such a sent one.</p>
<p>Paul went back again and again to every home of the saints, exhorting them and advising them with tears. An apostle should speak full of sympathy, with tears. Do you want to be an apostle? Then learn how to weep. In Acts 20:19, Paul said that he served the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears. Then in verse 31 he says that he did not cease admonishing each one of the saints with tears. An apostle tells the dear ones under his shepherding everything concerning God and His counsel with tears. He does not only speak publicly, but he also visits the homes of the saints.</p>
<p>In the Summer Training of 1987 in Anaheim, California, we went out to preach the gospel and baptized about three thousand seven hundred people. Later some told me that most of the ones we baptized were lower class people. When I heard this kind of talk, I was reminded of Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 1 that there are not many wellborn among us (v. 26) and that God has chosen the lowborn of the world and the despised (v. 28). According to 1 Corinthians 1, the Lord has not chosen or called many wealthy, higher class people. Instead He has chosen and predestinated thousands and thousands of poor, lower class people. I was one of the lowborn of the world, but the Lord called me. I grew up in a poor family, not a rich family. In Luke 14 the Lord told us to go out into the roads and hedges (v. 23). The rich people, the high class people, are not in the hedges. The Lord Jesus was charging us to go to the lower class people in the hedges to compel them to enter into the kingdom of God. After they enter into the kingdom of God, we need to visit them again and again in their homes in order to perfect them.</p>
<p>The apostles perfected the saints by visiting them. In Acts 20 Paul sent for the elders in Ephesus to come to him, and he told them that he had stayed with them for three years, teaching the saints publicly and by visiting them from house to house. There is a different teaching being taught today, saying that once the apostles have established the churches and appointed the elders, they should keep their hands off the churches and the elders. This is a wind of teaching that distracts the saints from the truth in God&rsquo;s word. Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years to touch many homes of the saints after the elders had already been established. This is a proper apostle. How could a mother who gave birth to some children, keep her hands off her children once they have been born, leaving them as orphans? It is a wrong and damaging teaching to say that the apostle should have nothing to do with the churches once they have been established and the elders have been appointed. If the apostles keep their hands off the churches and the elders, the saints cannot be perfected and the Body cannot be built up. Acts 20 reveals that the way to be an apostle is to stay with a church like Paul did. I regret that since I came to the United States over twenty-five years ago, I have never stayed in a place for a longer time to teach and to bring the elders into the proper eldership. My concern is that it might be that a number of the elders in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are taking the lead in the churches in a probing way. This is because they have not been fully perfected to be proper elders. I am looking to the Lord that He would give me the time to stay in a place the way Paul did for three years to perfect the elders and the saints.</p>
<p>I did this kind of perfecting work from 1940 to 1942 in Chefoo. At the end of 1942, a great revival broke forth in Chefoo as a result of my staying with the church there for this period of time. During that time I spoke to the saints publicly at the podium, and I visited them in their homes. I rode my bicycle to visit the homes of the saints, and I talked with them about their problems. During the day, I went to visit them, and in the evening I spoke to them publicly. I followed Paul&rsquo;s example to teach them publicly and from house to house. One time the Lord led me to invite all of the approximately three hundred saints in Chefoo to eat with me over a period of time. At one time I would invite ten saints, and at another time twenty saints. I did this on the evenings when we did not have meetings. I hired a brother to cook the meals, and I used a room in the meeting hall to receive the dear saints so that we could eat together and fellowship together. Within a period of a few months, I contacted most of the saints in the church in Chefoo in this way. To invite the saints into your home is more effective than ten messages. Brother Eugene Gruhler Sr., a brother among us who went to the Lord in 1973, never spoke at the podium, but hundreds of saints testified that they received the help in his home. Brother Gruhler invited saint after saint into his home in order to shepherd them. In this sense, he was a very good apostle.</p><h2 class="head2">By Writing Epistles to the Churches</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; perfecting work was also carried out by their writing epistles to the churches. Paul&rsquo;s heart was in the churches. If there was not the possibility for him to visit the churches, he wrote to them. In his writing, he rebuked, corrected, nourished, taught, and admonished the saints (1 Cor. 1:10-13; 3:3-4, 2; 12:31; 4:14). In his Epistle to the Galatians, he unveiled Christ to the saints and labored on them that Christ might be formed in them (1:16a; 4:19). In his Epistles, Paul also ministered Christ and His riches to the saints for the building up of the church to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal economy (Eph. 3:8-10). Paul ministered Christ and His unsearchable riches to the saints in his writing, especially in Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. In his Epistles, Paul warned and taught the saints to present each of them to God full-grown in Christ (Col. 1:28). Paul also indicated that what he wrote to the churches was to be read by all the saints (Col. 4:16; 1 Cor. 1:2). What an apostle Paul was! He is a pattern of what an apostle should be.</p>
<p>All of us need to be perfected to do what Paul did. We need to be the sent ones. We can go to the homes, visit the new ones, and bring God to them, ministering Christ into them. After some have received the Lord and have been baptized, we can go again to visit them in their homes two times a week, exhorting them with tears. The church can be doubled yearly, if some faithful ones will pick up the burden to visit people in their homes with the gospel and visit the newly saved ones to perfect them and establish them.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has experienced the Lord&rsquo;s blessing as a result of their taking this way, the scriptural way of meeting and serving. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., they have one hundred six district meetings, and the total number of regular attendants is four thousand five hundred. About one-third of this number have learned to speak the Lord to one another with short messages of about three minutes. Thus, every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning about fifteen hundred people speak Christ to one another, to the angels, and to the demons and the Devil. There is a rich exhibition of Christ in the district meetings in Taipei. The churches in Brazil and in the neighboring countries in South America have also experienced the Lord&rsquo;s blessing as a result of taking the new way, the scriptural way, of meeting and serving. In 1984 there were over eighty churches in Brazil, South America. As a result of taking the new way, there are now two hundred fifty-three churches in South America; over two hundred of them are in Brazil. Recently, the brothers from Brazil and neighboring countries in South America wrote me a letter, inviting me to come to visit them. This letter was signed by two hundred and fifty-five of the leading brothers in these countries. The saints there are very eager to go on with the Lord in His up-to-date move. All of us need to go on with the Lord to be perfected and to perfect others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Assigning Their Co-workers to Stay<br />
in Certain Places to Perfect the Saints</h2>
<p>The Scriptures also reveal that Paul assigned his co-workers to stay in certain places to perfect the saints, such as his assigning Timothy to stay in Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:3-4; 3:15) and his assigning Titus to stay in Crete (Titus 1:5). In 1 Timothy and Titus, Paul gave many instructions to these dear brothers regarding how to take care of the church and how to teach the church. Paul told Timothy in 1 Timothy 3:15, &ldquo;But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.&rdquo; This indicates that 1 Timothy gives instructions concerning how to take care of a local church. Paul wrote his letter to Timothy that he might know how to behave, how to go out and come in, in the church, which is the house of the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Teaching the Saints to Do the Work<br />
of the New Testament Ministry, That Is,<br />
to Build Up the Body of Christ as the Apostles Do</h2>
<p>According to Ephesians 4:11 and 12, the apostles teach the saints to do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ, as the apostles do. I have the burden to perfect the saints in the churches that the Lord has raised up through my ministry. My expectation is that after the saints receive my perfecting, they will do the same work that I do. I expect that many saints will be perfected to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord even for three minutes in the way of teaching and revelation. Many saints need to be perfected to do what the apostles do to build up the Body of Christ. The professors in a university expect their students to be perfected to do what they do.</p>
<p>I hope that many of the brothers would be perfected and have something to minister in different aspects in the line of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The writers of the New Testament talked about Christ, but they spoke concerning Christ from different angles and not in the same way. Mark did not copy Matthew nor did Matthew copy Luke. These three writers of the synoptic Gospels did not teach the same thing concerning Christ as John did in his Gospel. The Epistles of Paul, Peter, and John speak the same thing from different angles and with new light. God&rsquo;s speaking in His oracle is with new light.</p>
<p>When I was with Brother Nee in mainland China, I felt glorious to quote his word. I did this hundreds of times, and I mentioned his name many times. However, I have also spoken concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy with new light from the Lord. Many of the saints can testify that I have mentioned other saints in the past who have helped us with the light that they received from God&rsquo;s Word. I have encouraged the saints to read Brother Andrew Murray&rsquo;s masterpiece, <em>The Spirit of Christ,</em> and also his book <em>The Holy of Holies,</em> which is his expounding of the book of Hebrews. I have pointed the saints to Mary McDonough&rsquo;s book <em>God&rsquo;s Plan of Redemption.</em> I encouraged the saints to read the book <em>Life on the Highest Plane</em> by Ruth Paxon. I have introduced the saints to the writings of Jesse Penn-Lewis, G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, D. M. Panton, Madame Guyon, Father Fenelon, and T. Austin-Sparks. I encouraged the saints to read these writings because I realized that the truth contained in them could perfect the saints. Many of the saints, however, have not been perfected to the extent that they can discern what is true and profitable in the writings of others. If we read spiritual books without the proper discernment, we can be deceived and misled by winds of teaching that are not according to the truth of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
 <p>Recently the teaching of autonomy from G. H. Lang&rsquo;s book <em>The Churches of God</em> has been brought into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is wrong to teach that each local church is an autonomy in the absolute sense. This is the reason that the Lord gave me the burden to point out that the church as the Body of Christ is an organism that is altogether organic. Lang accused Darby of attempting to federate the local assemblies of the Brethren. Autonomy and federation are political terms, both of which should not be used in reference to the church. The members of our physical body are not each autonomous. The only item that is an autonomy in my physical body is my denture. My denture is an autonomy because it is not of life, and it is not organically related to the rest of my body. Each member of our physical body is organically related to the other members in life. Our physical body also enjoys the unique circulation of one blood. In like manner, the members of the Body of Christ are all organically related to one another in life and enjoy the one fellowship of the Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s church as His organic Body, which is an organism, has nothing to do with autonomy or federation. This is because the Lord&rsquo;s church is not an organization, but an organism that is altogether organic. I pointed out in Cleveland that the church as the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God in the organic union of His divine Trinity.</p>
<p>I must warn the saints not to receive the teaching contained in Lang&rsquo;s book <em>The Churches of God.</em> The teaching of autonomy in the absolute sense is a wind of teaching that will distract the saints away from God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to have the Body of Christ organically built up for His corporate expression in the way of life. It is dangerous for us to read books that can distract us from God&rsquo;s central purpose. If we do not have the proper discernment, we can be distracted by the winds of teaching. To read such material will waste our time, our money, and our energy. Furthermore, we may receive a wrong teaching into our being that will create problems among us. We should not allow any teaching to come in among us that is different from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to tell certain ones not to teach differently from God&rsquo;s economy (1 Tim. 1:3-4). I have a real burden and a duty to warn the saints not to receive any teaching that is different from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The teaching of the gifted persons listed in Ephesians 4:11 must be the teaching according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. These gifted persons teach the saints to do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ in the organic way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPHETS&rsquo; PERFECTING</h2>
<p>According to the record of the New Testament, it is not adequate for a prophet merely to visit a church. He must stay with a church in order to perfect the saints. Acts 13:1 says that in the church in Antioch there were some prophets and teachers. The prophets were in the church in Antioch to perfect the saints to speak for the Lord. The professors in a college need to stay in their school at least two or three times a week in order to take care of their classes. They must do this constantly, regularly, and continually to perfect their students. The ones among us who have learned to speak the Lord as prophets should stay in a certain church to perfect the saints. The prophets perfect the saints by teaching them to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into people to do the work of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ, as the prophets do. Teaching means instructing and implies allowing the saints to practice speaking for the Lord.</p>
<p>A prophet who is staying with a church should not merely speak in the meetings but should go to visit all the members of the church in order to perfect them. Sometimes he may instruct the saints in a small group, and sometimes he may tutor certain saints, that is, help one saint at a time. His burden is that the saints would learn how to speak for the Lord in a meeting. To teach students a course takes a period of time. One cannot teach a course in just one day or a few days. A prophet who is burdened to perfect the saints must speak in the meeting to spontaneously set up a model. According to the model he has set up, he can then contact the saints to perfect them.</p>
<p>It is not profitable to attempt to instruct the entire congregation at one time. If there are twenty-five saints meeting together in a certain local church, a brother who is a prophet could observe that among these twenty-five, two or three are prominent. These ones could be considered as the head sheep in a flock, the leading ones. First, he should try to help these two or three, to perfect them, to instruct them in the matter of prophesying.</p>
<p>To learn anything that can build up the Body of Christ requires a spiritual life. Therefore, a prophet has to help the church first of all in a general way. He would tell the saints that since we all love the Lord, and we know that the Lord desires to build up His Body by our growth in life, we must have a daily revival. Every morning after we rise up, we have to have a new start with the Lord. Lamentations tells us that the Lord&rsquo;s compassions are new every morning (3:22-23). The Lord&rsquo;s kindness and mercy are fresh every morning like the morning dew. Every morning, even according to the natural law, there is a new start. Even in the new heaven and new earth outside the New Jerusalem, the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months (Rev. 22:2), and the sun will also be there to separate day and night into periods of twelve hours each (21:23, 25). Therefore, we must follow the natural law in God&rsquo;s creation. In the new creation we must have a new start every day.</p>
<p>Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;The path of the righteous is as the dawning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day&rdquo; (ASV). In the Christian life, there is no afternoon. The Chinese expression for <em>afternoon</em> means going down from noon, while the Chinese expression for <em>morning</em> means going up to noon. Our Christian life should be a life that is going up to noon. Sometimes, however, we experience a going down from noon. But when we go to bed, the dawning of the sun is awaiting us. We can have a new start with the Lord. Every twenty-four hours there is a new start.</p>
<p>We must be revived every morning. Then we must daily live an overcoming life. An overcoming life is to live Christ by walking in our spirit. Every morning we should experience Christ as the rising sun to be revived by Him, and all day long we should live Christ. We must be such persons so that we can learn how to speak Christ. Without such a life, such a living, how can we speak Christ? If a brother quarrels with his wife and behaves recklessly, how can he go out to preach the gospel? He will not be able to speak Christ. If we are defeated in our Christian life or are angry with others, we cannot speak Christ. To speak Christ requires a victorious life, a life that is right in the morning and overcoming the entire day. Then we are qualified and have the capital to do the business of speaking Christ.</p>
<p>If I am a prophet staying with the church, I must speak with the saints for three weeks concerning being revived every morning and living a victorious life every day. This will lay a foundation. All the saints will be helped by my speaking. My speaking will stir them up to practice the morning revival. After rising up early, immediately we should call on the name of the Lord and talk to Him, converse with Him. Then we can get into His Word. We can use two to four verses from the Scriptures to enjoy Him by eating the Word. This practice will give us a new start with the Lord in the morning. Then as we walk in the Spirit during the day, we can easily speak Christ at any time. A prophet would fellowship with the saints, showing them these things of the Lord by his experience and through the study of the Word of God. Then he would instruct the saints how to compose a short message that they could speak in the meetings for about three minutes. If a prophet stayed with a church composed of twenty-five saints and exercised to perfect them in this way, after about two years, most of the saints would be prophets in the church meetings. We need this kind of perfecting work in the churches.</p>
<p>In the past I studied Ephesians 4:11-16 many times, but I never saw so clearly that in order to have the saints meeting according to what is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we must enter into the reality of Ephesians 4:11-16. I began to practice this in Taipei, and the church in Taipei has experienced the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. As the saints experience Christ and enjoy the Word, there will be a gradual accumulation of the riches of Christ in their being day after day and week after week. No matter how busy the saints are in their jobs, at their schools, or with their families, they need to be helped to rise early in the morning to enjoy Christ as their sunrise. Then they will have a base to experience Christ during the day. If we help the saints practice in this way for about one year, most of them will be good prophets and their speaking will enrich the meeting. There will be no need to wait for someone to speak in the meeting. Most of the saints will be eager to present a three minute message. If twenty-five saints each spoke in this way for three minutes, there would be a rich meeting with twenty-five short messages for one hour and fifteen minutes. Think about how living and how rich such a meeting would be. This kind of meeting would help people, attract people, and keep people.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things in the church life is to maintain the number of saints who meet together. If there are a hundred fifty saints meeting together, after half a year the attendance may go down to a hundred five. The number of meeting ones in the churches goes down and down because the meetings are poor and full of emptiness. In the old way of meeting with one man speaking and the rest listening, the saints eventually become bored. It is hard to maintain the number of people in the meetings with one man&rsquo;s speaking, unless he is quite learned and eloquent. Still, by his eloquence he could only build up a congregation, not the Body of Christ. Do we like to have a very attractive congregation as a marvelous facade for display? Surely we would rather see the genuine building up of the Body of Christ in the organic way. We need meetings in which many of the saints speak Christ. In meetings like these, we can be nourished with the riches of Christ. These kinds of meetings will change people&rsquo;s lives, and this will build the saints together. The saints will not be built together into a society or an organization by a certain kind of attraction, but they will be built together by the increase of the inner life. In this way there will be the transformation of the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The saints can be perfected to be apostles and prophets. They can also be perfected to be evangelists and shepherd-teachers. Some may ask, &ldquo;Who are the apostles among us, who are the prophets, who are the evangelists, and who are the shepherd-teachers?&rdquo; We need to be perfected to do what all these gifted persons do and to be what they are. I like to see a church in which everybody is everything and everybody is nothing. This is the most spiritual church. We must be able to do everything.</p>
<h2 class="head1">1 CORINTHIANS 14 AND EPHESIANS 4 BEING<br />
TWO OUTSTANDING CHAPTERS IN UNVEILING<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS THE BODY OF CHRIST, AN ORGANISM</h2>
<p>We need to see that 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 are the two outstanding chapters in unveiling the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, an organism. In the four Gospels, the only clear word concerning the building up of the church is in Matthew 16:18 where the Lord says, &ldquo;On this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; First Corinthians and Ephesians are two particular books on the building up of the Body of Christ. We should dive into the truth in these two books and learn the teaching they contain. If we can enter into the truth revealed in these books, the Lord can have a way to work out His New Testament economy in our age and before our eyes. Each one of us needs to be perfected by the four kinds of &ldquo;professors,&rdquo; gifted persons&mdash;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. We need to be willing to be perfected by these professors. If you feel that you are one of the professors, you have to do what the professors do. You must teach your students with the goal of helping them to do the same thing that you are doing. My burden is to labor day and night to see 1 Corinthians 14:26 fulfilled by Ephesians 4:11-16.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING PERFECTED TO SPEAK CHRIST</h2>
<p>We have seen that to build up the Body of Christ, the best gift, the excelling gift, is to prophesy. To prophesy is not mainly to predict, but rather to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, to speak the Lord into others. This is the excelling gift that is needed for the building up of the Body of Christ. In 1 Corinthians there is the principle of speaking Christ but not the details concerning how to help and make all the saints speak forth Christ. To speak gossip is easy. No learning is required for this. However, if you are going to speak Christ, you must learn much and practice much. You must practice not only your utterance but also your boldness. To talk to people about the weather, about your family, about the world situation, or about the news is easy; you do not need to exercise any energy or any boldness. But when you speak Christ to people, it seems that the whole universe is trying to frustrate you. When you talk about something other than Christ, you do not feel ashamed, but when you talk about Jesus, you may have a feeling of shame. This is why you need to practice speaking Christ. When someone begins to play the piano, it is easy for him to make mistakes. To play the piano properly, one must concentrate his entire being and be under strict instruction with much practice. It is the same with speaking Christ.</p>
<p>To speak Christ requires much learning. This is why we have Ephesians 4 in addition to 1 Corinthians 14. Ephesians 4 says that Christ as the ascended Head has given many gifts, many gifted persons, for the perfecting of the saints. Paul and Peter were given to the church as gifts. How about all of us? We need to realize that all of us are gifts to the Body also (Eph. 4:8). Not only the big shoulders are gifts to our physical bodies but also our little fingers are given to our physical bodies as gifts. Christ has given us as gifts to His Body. The practice of traditional Christianity, however, does not give all the members of the Body of Christ an opportunity to function. The traditional way annuls the function of nearly every part of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Those who are practicing the traditional way are still taking the excuse that not everyone is capable. Since not everyone is capable of singing properly, they feel that they must have some who have the talent of singing. But the Bible tells us that all the saints should sing (Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16). The Psalms tell us to make a joyful noise to the Lord (95:1; 100:1). Although I have composed many hymns, I am not an accomplished singer. However, I still have to sing, and I enjoy singing to the Lord. The Lord enjoys the singing of all the saints. He does not care for a proper melody, but He likes to hear a joyful noise full of praises to Him. When we sing in the spirit and with the Spirit, this is pleasing to God.</p>
<p>We must learn one thing&mdash;whatever we do in the meeting, we must do it with our spirit and with Christ as the content. We all have to speak for the Lord so that the Body of Christ can be built up (1 Cor. 14:4). The Bible does not charge us so much concerning how to speak or how to sing. It simply charges us to speak and to sing. Even though we cannot carry a tune, if we sing in the spirit with Christ as the content, this singing is sweet to the Triune God. Furthermore, we do not need to speak eloquently. We need to learn to speak Christ. All of us need much learning to speak Christ in a proper way.</p>
<p>In the traditional way of one person speaking and the rest listening, a congregation is built up. When all the saints exercise to speak Christ in the church meetings, however, the Body of Christ is built up. We need to see the difference between building up a congregation and building up the Body of Christ. A congregation is a kind of gathering, or assembly. There are many congregations in the Christian denominations, but none of these congregations practice the very building up of the Body of Christ. To build up a congregation, there is the need of a learned, eloquent speaker. This speaker needs to know how to tell stories, give illustrations, and even tell jokes. He learns the techniques of how to attract people and how to keep people coming to hear him speak. Eventually this speaker has built up a congregation. If he were to die, however, this congregation would gradually disappear. To build up a congregation in this way is to build up an organization.</p>
<p>The meeting in the congregational way seldom touches your life; it seldom touches what you are; it seldom touches your very being. Many are devoted members of certain denominational congregations, and they might be regenerated, but their lives are never touched by these congregational meetings. The speaking by the pastors there rarely touches people&rsquo;s inner being.</p>
<p>The practice of building up the Body of Christ is absolutely different from the traditional way of Christianity. It is not so easy for all the saints to speak something in a big congregation. According to Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3, we need to speak the hymns in the meetings. The speaking of the hymns works best in small group meetings. When we speak the hymns one to another with the exercise of our spirit, every sentence touches our being and every sentence ministers Christ into our being. Such speaking does not build up a congregation but builds up the Body of Christ. In a meeting with everyone speaking, it may seem that nothing is attractive. The singing may be poor, and the speaking may not be eloquent. The traditional way to meet in Christianity is meant to be attractive. There are eloquent speakers, talented choirs and soloists, and magnificent chapels and cathedrals. Furthermore, there is no requirement on the audience to do anything except listen and give some offerings, but hardly anything in this way of meeting touches a person&rsquo;s life. In the scriptural way of meeting without any outward attraction, the speaking, singing, praying, and praising touch our being.</p>
<p>We could speak verses five and six of hymn #537 to one another:</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ to me is so subjective,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulating all the day;<br />
He corrects and rules and guides me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And adjusts in every way.</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ to me is so subjective,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my thirst He satisfies;<br />
With His riches He supplies me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus God&rsquo;s fullness testifies.</p>
<p>When we speak these verses to one another, our being is touched concerning our fellowship with the Lord and concerning how much we have been regulated by Him. The words &ldquo;regulating,&rdquo; &ldquo;corrects,&rdquo; &ldquo;rules,&rdquo; &ldquo;guides,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusts,&rdquo; &ldquo;satisfies,&rdquo; and &ldquo;supplies&rdquo; touch us. All of us are touched by speaking such a hymn.</p>
<p>Hymn #537 describes how subjective Christ is to us in our daily life. He is subjective to us for the building up of His Body. He causes us to repent and be regenerated, sanctified, and transformed. He is adjusting and correcting us all the time, even with many rebukes. He is correcting, rebuking, regulating, ruling, guiding, supplying, satisfying, and comforting us. We are under His transforming work all day long, and we are being conformed to His image. We are growing in life, and our growth is actually His increase [growth] in us. The very indwelling Christ is increasing in us. His increase in us is our growth in Him. By growing into Him, we are being transformed and we become the living members of Christ. In our transformation, we will realize that we cannot be individualistic and that we have to be built up with others for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>After meeting in the proper church life and experiencing the building up of the Body of Christ, one will have the sensation that he is an organic member of the Body of Christ. If he goes to a place where there is no church life, he will feel isolated. He will feel that he has no place to get more growth in life, to have some fellowship, to get the supply, and to supply others. He will have the sensation that he has lost the enjoyment of Christ in His Body. This shows that such a brother has experienced the riches of Christ and has been organically built up with many of the saints on this earth.</p>
<p>When you have such a Body-consciousness, you can discern the difference between the building up of a congregation and the building up of the Body of Christ. You are able to discern that the ones who meet in the congregational way may only know how to participate in outward and social things. They may not know the fellowship in the Body or the growth in life. If you go to a place where the building up of the Body of Christ is being practiced, you can sense it. You may go to a place where they speak another language, but when you listen to their prayers and to their &ldquo;amens,&rdquo; you have the enjoyment of Christ with the fellowship. You have the inner feeling and sensation that these are your brothers, the members of the Body of Christ on this earth. This shows that you are a member of the Body of Christ that has been organically built up with other members.</p>
<p>A congregation meeting according to the traditional way does not need to speak Christ. They may need a pipe organ, good singing from a choir, and an eloquent speech from one person. However, they do not learn to speak Christ. In a proper church meeting according to the revelation of the Scriptures and for the building up of the Body of Christ, there is the need of much speaking of Christ. It is much sweeter to have a meeting of seven persons speaking Christ to one another than to have a meeting of a large congregation with only one man speaking. When these seven persons pray, sing, and converse with you, you will feel that Christ is with them. For this kind of small group meeting, we must learn to speak Christ, to prophesy. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:26, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has....&rdquo; Some need to have a psalm to speak Christ and to sing about Him. There is the need for much prophesying. The saints in the meeting need to speak for Christ, speak forth Christ, and speak Christ into one another. After this kind of meeting, we will feel that we have had a good meal. We will all be satisfied and return home with much joy. Such a meeting supplies us to live a victorious life. This is absolutely different from the traditional way of one man speaking and the rest listening.</p>
<p>Even if the person speaking in the traditional way knows how to speak Christ and minister Christ to the audience, his capability and riches can never replace the capability and the riches of the many members of the Body of Christ. One man speaking cannot replace the riches of ten people speaking Christ. Regardless of how wonderful a person&rsquo;s messages are, the congregation may eventually get tired of his speaking. The saints may get bored with one person speaking to them again and again all the time. This indicates that the traditional way of one man speaking easily becomes old, but the scriptural way of all the members speaking Christ is always fresh and refreshing.</p>
<p>If we go to a church meeting and do not speak, we may not feel that the meeting was so good. Whenever we speak Christ in a meeting, however, that meeting becomes a wonderful meeting to us. When a husband comes home from a meeting in which he does not speak, he may tell his wife that the meeting was not so good. However, if the husband speaks in the meeting, he will tell his wife what a marvelous meeting it was. If we speak Christ in the meetings, participate in the meetings, we will continually come to the meetings. We will be strong, trustworthy regulars in the church meetings. We will be those who look for any occasion to speak Christ in the meetings. The riches of Christ can only be displayed thoroughly when many speak Christ. Each member has a particular experience of Christ to speak forth that the other members do not have.</p>
<p>We have to learn to serve the Lord by ministering the Lord to others. We need to be perfected to speak Christ to others. What is needed for the building up of the Body of Christ is for us to minister or to dispense Christ into others. The most excelling way to minister Christ to others is to speak Christ. If we do not know how to speak Christ, it is hard for us to minister Christ to others. This is why Paul exalted the speaking of Christ to the uttermost in 1 Corinthians 14. In the first verse he says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Near the end of the chapter in verse 39 he says, &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo; The entire chapter is an encouragement, encouraging us to prophesy, that is, to speak for or to speak forth or even to speak Christ into others, for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>The way for the truth of 1 Corinthians 14 to be accomplished is by Ephesians 4:11-16. The gifted members must exercise their patience to teach, instruct, and train the saints to do what they do. They need to take the way of a coach by giving the saints every opportunity to function. A coach instructs and guides while letting the others play. The saints need to be perfected by the gifted persons to speak Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EVANGELISTS&rsquo; PERFECTING</h2>
<p>An evangelist perfects the saints by stirring them up to be burning in the gospel-preaching spirit. An evangelist must have the ability to stir up the saints, to set them on fire for the gospel. An evangelist should burn the whole church in the gospel-preaching spirit. We may not be qualified to perfect the saints as an evangelist because we do not have such a gospel-preaching spirit. Our spirit may be very cold instead. How can others be very strong and hot in preaching the gospel if we are not? A real evangelist has a burning spirit within him that stirs others up to preach the gospel. We need this kind of perfecting.</p>
<p>In our training in Taipei, we taught the saints some techniques in preaching the gospel. We found out that the most effective way to gain people for the Lord is to visit them in their homes by knocking on their doors. Many saints were not let into people&rsquo;s homes because their way was wrong. In the training we taught the saints the proper technique so that people would be open to letting them in their homes. There is the need of such skill, but I do not consider this as a kind of perfecting of the saints in gospel preaching.</p>
<p>To perfect the saints in gospel preaching, the first thing the evangelists have to do is to stir them up. Then they have to teach the saints with the gospel truths. The saints need to be taught what it means to repent and what it is to believe in the Lord Jesus. There are many gospel truths that need to be imparted into the saints. The evangelists also need to train the saints to preach the gospel. They have to train them how to preach, how to speak, how to contact people, and how to converse with people. They also need to equip the saints with the power of the economical Spirit. This means that they themselves must be experientially and presently under the outpouring of the Spirit. The evangelists should also set an example of loving the sinners and praying for them. They must have an overwhelming concern for the salvation of sinners.</p>
<p>The evangelists preach Christ, the unsearchable riches of Christ, and the kingdom of God as the gospel in the way of dispensing for the building up of the Body of Christ, and they teach the saints to do the same thing (Acts 5:42; Eph. 3:8; Acts 8:12). To preach about going to hell or to heaven is too low. That kind of preaching is not adequate for the building up of the Body of Christ. We have to preach Christ as the gospel according to Acts 5:42; we have to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel according to Ephesians 3:8; and we have to preach the kingdom of God as the gospel according to Acts 8:12. This kind of preaching is in the way of dispensing Christ. The evangelists&rsquo; perfecting work is to equip and furnish the saints in gospel preaching to do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ. We need this kind of perfecting in order to fully enter into the reality of 1 Corinthians 14:26.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHEPHERD-TEACHERS&rsquo; PERFECTING</h2>
<p>The shepherd-teachers perfect the saints by shepherding&mdash;feeding and nourishing the young saints. We need to teach others to take care of the young saints, the new believers. The shepherd-teachers also perfect the saints by teaching the growing saints (Acts 11:25-26; 13:1). Finally, the shepherd-teachers raise, equip, and furnish the saints to do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ, as the shepherd-teachers do.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BY THE GIFTED PERSONS<br />
AND THE BUILDING UP BY THE PERFECTED SAINTS</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of building up&mdash;one is by the gifted persons and the other is by the perfected saints. The building up of the Body of Christ by the gifted persons is under the Head&rsquo;s supply and is done indirectly. The gifted persons do not build up the Body of Christ directly. Even Christ as the Head of the church does not build the church directly. In Matthew 16:18 the Lord told us that He would build His church, but He builds His church indirectly through His giving of the gifts to His Body. Then these gifts perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the building work directly. The building up of the Body of Christ by the perfected saints is under the gifted persons&rsquo; perfecting and is done directly. Ephesians 4:16 says that the Body will build itself up in love because all the members build up the Body of Christ. They build up the Body of Christ by growing into the Head in all things (Eph. 4:15). The growth in life of each member of the Body added together equals the building up of the Body. The perfected saints also build up the Body by functioning out from the Head, causing the growth of the Body that the Body may be built up directly by itself (4:16).</p>
<p>We must have this kind of perfecting work among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We must enter into this new light. The co-workers and the elders especially must immediately start to practice this. We should learn how to be apostles, how to be prophets, how to be evangelists, and how to be shepherd-teachers. We need to spend the time to teach each of the saints. After a certain period of time, many of the saints will have the ability to speak Christ. They will practice speaking Christ daily, and at the end of each week they will have prepared something to offer in the larger church meeting. Then in the church meeting spontaneously 1 Corinthians 14:26 will be fulfilled. The attendants will not be waiting for inspiration, but they will have something already.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul uses the word &ldquo;has&rdquo; five times. He does not say that we will have but that we have something already. When we come to the meeting we should already have something. It would be tragic if I came to a meeting for the ministry of the word and did not have something to speak. It would be a tragedy if I had to ask the saints to pray that the Lord would give me something to speak. Every attendant of the church meeting must have something when he comes to the meeting. This is just like the Israelites in the ancient time who went to the festival in Jerusalem three times a year with something of the produce of the good land in their hands. God charged them not to appear before Him empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). We may have been Christians for many years and members in a local church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for years. However, how many times did we have something of Christ with us to speak when we came to the church meetings? We may have had the thought when we came to the meetings that someone else would speak for us. We need to build up a habit of bringing something of Christ to the meeting to speak.</p>
<p>If the co-workers and elders endeavor to practice this new light, they will develop the ability to teach others. The co-workers and elders especially need to teach others to do what the apostles do, what the prophets do, what the evangelists do, and what the shepherd-teachers do. Then the whole church will be full of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. What a church this will be! Spontaneously there will be the building up of the Body of Christ among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">AN ORGANIC BUILDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:13-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE VISION OF THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to go on to see the organic building up of the Body of Christ revealed in Ephesians 4:13-16. In order to understand these verses thoroughly, we must read them very attentively and carefully. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; To &ldquo;arrive&rdquo; indicates that we have to go on. Without going on, there will be no arrival. Therefore, we all have to go on until we arrive at three things. First, we need to arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. The faith refers to what we believe in, which is mainly the redemptive work of Christ, the completed work of Christ. The full knowledge of the Son of God refers to the person of Christ. The oneness is of the completed, redemptive work of Christ and of the wonderful person of Christ. Second, we need to arrive at a full-grown man. Third, we need to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; In this verse there are the wind and the waves. The storms on the sea come from the wind and the waves. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In verse 16 we need a crucial correction in translation that is more accurate according to the Greek. Verse 16 can be translated: &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, joined together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; In our body there are the joints and all the parts. The joints are joined together, and all the parts are knit together. The joining refers to the joints, and the knitting refers to all the other parts.</p>
<p>In order to understand verse 16 adequately, we must see the subject and the predicate. &ldquo;All the Body&rdquo; is the subject, and the predicate is &ldquo;causes.&rdquo; The basic sentence of this verse reads this way: &ldquo;All the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; In between the subject &ldquo;all the Body&rdquo; and the predicate &ldquo;causes&rdquo; there is a long adjective phrase that modifies &ldquo;all the Body.&rdquo; All the Body is joined together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. Out from the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body.</p>
<p>The predicate &ldquo;causes&rdquo; is modified by three prepositional phrases that act as adverbs: &ldquo;out from whom,&rdquo; &ldquo;unto the building up of itself,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in love.&rdquo; All the Body causes the growth of the Body from what source? Out from the Head. All the Body causes the growth of the Body unto what purpose? Unto the building up of itself. All the Body causes the growth of the Body in what way? In love. The sentence could read this way: &ldquo;All the Body, out from the Head, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the Body causes the growth of the Body by being joined together through the rich supply of all the joints and by being knit together through the operation in measure of each one part. Through the rich supply of the joints and through the operation in measure of each one part, the entire Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. Ephesians 4:16 talks about the organic building up of the Body. The building up of the Body takes place by the Body causing itself to grow. Through the supply of the joints and the operation of each one part in its measure, the entire Body is joined together and knit together. Then the Body works by causing itself to grow for the purpose of the building up of itself in love as an organism. Ephesians 4:16 is the unique verse in the Bible that tells us how the organic Body of Christ can be practically built up in the organic way.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;On this rock I will build My church.&rdquo; We need to see what the rock is in Matthew 16:18. Many Christians would say that the rock is the living Christ. That means that Christ will build the church upon Himself. Strictly speaking, this is a wrong interpretation. The rock does not refer to Christ directly. It refers to the revelation of Christ received by the apostles. In Matthew 16 the Lord asked the disciples, &ldquo;Who do you say that I am?&rdquo; (v. 15). Peter answered, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). Then the Lord told Peter that he was blessed because flesh and blood had not revealed this to him but His Father in the heavens (v. 17). Peter received the revelation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. This revelation of Christ is the rock upon which He builds His church.</p>
<p>This corresponds with Ephesians 2:20 which tells us that the church as the house of God is being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone. According to 1 Corinthians 3:11, the foundation is Jesus Christ. Ephesians 2, however, says that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Furthermore, in Ephesians 2, Christ is not the foundation but the cornerstone that joins together the two walls, one of the Jewish believers and the other of the Gentile believers. The foundation is the revelation concerning Christ received by the apostles and prophets. This implies that the Lord Jesus would not build up His church directly. He builds up His church through the apostles and through the prophets.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4 we are told that the very Christ who is building up His church gave many gifts. He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the purpose of perfecting the saints. The Head does not build the church directly. He only gives the gifted persons for the building up of the church. Even the gifted persons, the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, do not build the church directly. They perfect all the members and the members do the building work directly to build up the Body of Christ. This is clearly revealed in Ephesians 4:16. After all the members have grown up into the Head in all things, out from this Head the entire Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. This growth is caused by the Body being joined together through the rich supply of the joints and being knit together through the operation of each part. The real building is by each one part. The Body is built directly by all the members, not by the gifts or by the Head directly.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 is the unique verse in the Bible that shows us how the organic Body of Christ is directly and practically built up. It is built up by each member. Based upon this revelation, we can say that the traditional way of meeting and serving in Christianity is absolutely wrong. We must see that the Body of Christ is built directly neither by the Head nor by the gifted persons but by all the members. The Body of Christ is built up organically by each member directly, but these members can do very little without being perfected. The perfecting is needed. Today in Christianity where is the perfecting of the believers? Many preachers speak every Lord&rsquo;s Day, but who is being perfected to do the work of the ministry? We also need to consider our situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in the United States since 1962. Within these twenty-six years, how much perfecting work has been going on among us? Who among us has been perfected? I am so burdened to see the Lord&rsquo;s desire accomplished among us that I do not care for the cost that I have to pay. I have seen something, and I have received a burden from the Lord to tell His people that we must drop the old way because with it there is not much perfecting of the saints.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is not organically built up by the Head directly. Ephesians 4 tells us clearly that the Head gives the gifts&mdash;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. He has done His work. He is sitting on the throne in the heavens waiting to see what these gifted persons will do. Paul did a marvelous job of perfecting the saints, and he provided a pattern for us of the way a gifted member should live and work. I have repented to the Lord very much for not perfecting the saints more in my ministry. My burden from the Lord is very heavy in this matter.</p>
<p>We must see that the enemy of God hates this! I have been speaking for the Lord for fifty-six years, and I have never been attacked as much as I have within these last two years. This opposition is altogether illogical and unreasonable because it has not been originated by any person. It has been originated by the adversary of our God, Satan. He works through people to frustrate God&rsquo;s desire for the organic building up of the Body of Christ. In Paul&rsquo;s last Epistle, 2 Timothy, just before his martyrdom, he said that all Asia had turned away from him (1:15). All of Asia had rejected his ministry. This rejection of Paul&rsquo;s ministry, which is the New Testament ministry, is something instigated by God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. I have prepared myself that at my going to the Lord my ministry may suffer the same thing as Paul&rsquo;s. All of Asia including the church in Ephesus forsook Paul&rsquo;s ministry, but Paul was still joyful. He told his young co-worker Timothy to be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus (2:1).</p>
<p>Brother Nee told us in his book <em>Church Affairs</em> that to have the traditional meeting on Sunday morning is according to the custom of the nations. Second Kings 17:8 in the New American Standard Bible says that the children of Israel sinned against the Lord by walking in the customs of the nations. According to the customs of the nations means according to the way of worshipping the idols. Brother Nee also told us that it is hard to take away the habit of meeting in the way of one person speaking and the rest listening. He said that we all need to push until such a habit and practice is pushed out of the way. The traditional way of meeting and serving annuls the functions of the members of Christ and does not develop the members. Therefore, there is no direct, actual, and practical building up of the Body of Christ. The Head has given the gifts, but regrettably many of the gifts have been abused to build up a big congregation, a big facade for a show. A congregation may be built up, but what members have been perfected to do the direct building of the Body of Christ? In locality after locality, the Lord desires to see all the saints perfected to be the living, functioning members of the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We must endeavor, strive, and struggle to tear down the old, traditional way. Some have the concept that the new way is preaching the gospel by door-knocking. This is a wrong realization and concept. The new way is not mainly to preach the gospel by knocking on doors, but it is the building up of Christ&rsquo;s organic Body directly by each one of the saints. If the Body of Christ is not being built up by each saint directly, we are in the traditional way. We need the gifted persons to perfect the saints to do this direct building work. The gifted ones need to go to the homes of the saints to sit down with them and teach them mouth to mouth. We saw from Acts 20 that Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years. He perfected the saints by teaching everything concerning God and His economy publicly and from house to house with tears. Who is doing this work among us today? The gifted ones need to go from house to house to perfect the saints with tears.</p>
<p>Some have criticized the way of visiting people by knocking on their doors to preach the gospel. They say that this way does not work. The reason it may not work is that after getting people baptized, they are not cared for adequately and properly. If a mother delivers a child and then neglects the child without giving him the proper care, can that child live? If we baptize someone and then go visit him twice a week with much prayer and labor, this new one can be nourished, raised up, and perfected. We baptized thousands and thousands of people in Taipei, but we found out that it is not so easy to raise them up. A child can be delivered within a short time, but mothers spend years to raise up a child properly. Even if the mother is sick, she still has to take care of her little one by nourishing and cherishing him. We need to take care of the new ones that we baptize as if we were caring for our little babes.</p>
<p>Paul bore the burden of the church all the time. In 2 Corinthians 11:28 he said, &ldquo;Apart from the things which are not mentioned, the pressure upon me daily, the anxiety for all the churches.&rdquo; &ldquo;Anxiety&rdquo; means anxious care. The care for the church was upon Paul&rsquo;s heart. This is why Paul called for the elders of Ephesus to come to him at Miletus when he was on his way to Jerusalem. Paul was so burdened for the perfecting of the saints. We need this perfecting work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. Without the perfecting of the saints, there cannot be the growth of the Body. The growth of the Body is the building up of the Body. A little babe grows gradually by being nourished and cherished all the time.</p>
<p>Because of the Lord&rsquo;s burden to have the building up of His Body, I would not count the cost to see this worked out. Sooner or later, the Lord Jesus, the Head, will do something. He is sovereign. He is on the throne. He is the One that directs the entire universe. He will do something to fulfill these two portions of the Word: 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4. I believe the time that He will take to accomplish this will not be too long. This is the end time. These two portions of the holy Word are not in vain. They will be fulfilled. Some of the ones who are very close to me feel unhappy that I am working so much. They warn me that I am over eighty and that I could die at any time. They advise me to take care of myself better. I would like to do this, but Someone within me will not let me go. I have to speak forth the Lord&rsquo;s burden in these days.</p>
<p>It is encouraging to see the Lord&rsquo;s working in Taipei. The saints there are in the transition from the old way to the new way to fulfill 1 Corinthians 14:26 by Ephesians 4:11-16. They are in a transition from one world to another world. They are growing, and they are under the joining and the knitting. They are in the experience of the Body causing the growth of the Body unto a direct building up of itself in love.</p>
<p>When I visited Korea recently, I told the young people there to rise up to drop the old way and pick up the new way to be the gifted persons. I told them that even though they were young, they could be the gifted persons to do the work of perfecting others. I encouraged them that maybe after five years, thousands of young people would be perfected, and they all would do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ organically and directly.</p>
<p>If we take this new way, this scriptural way, the so-called pastors will be unemployed. There will be no clergy and no laity. Instead of being pastors in the traditional way, we have to be little perfecters, laboring like the Apostle Paul did. The gifted persons should not speak to build up a congregation as a facade in order to make a name for themselves. The gifted ones need to go to the homes of the saints to perfect them. If a person labors by visiting the homes of the saints, in a sense he will be unknown because he does not display himself. There will not be a facade of a large congregation because the church will be scattered in all the small homes of the saints. Because the church life is basically in the homes, there will not be a display of a big congregation, but the One on the throne will see His Body under the proper, direct, organic building up. This kind of building up makes Him happy.</p>
<p>I hope that we can be impressed with the vision of the organic building up of the Body of Christ. The Lord will change us and altogether revolutionize us if we see this vision. Once we see this vision, we will have to give ourselves up for it. My desire is to both live and die to the Lord to see this vision, His heart&rsquo;s desire, carried out. On this earth there is the need of many young ones to be the perfecters. First, we have to be perfected by someone and by the Spirit through the Word. Then we need to learn how to perfect others to do the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ. Those of us who have seen the vision will be burdened to sacrifice ourselves as martyrs so that the Lord will have a way to fulfill Ephesians 4 for the purpose of having the building up of His organic Body through each saint speaking Him. We can all prophesy one by one. When all the saints are perfected to prophesy, to speak Christ, there will be meetings all over the earth that are full of mutuality according to 1 Corinthians 14:26. Then the traditional way of one person speaking and the rest listening will be fully pushed away. Every attendant in the meeting will be a speaker, building up the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ORGANIC BUILDING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">By Growing in Life</h2>
<p>This organic building is realized by our growing in life. If we are going to perfect others, we must help them to grow in life. In order to be perfected, we must grow not in our natural life but in the divine life, in the life of God which is Christ.</p>
<p>We grow in Christ by holding to truth&mdash;things that are true and real (Eph. 4:15a). &ldquo;Holding to truth&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;truthing it.&rdquo; Solomon told us in Ecclesiastes that all is vanity. &ldquo;Vanity of vanity...all is vanity&rdquo; (1:2). Because everything is vanity, the Apostle Paul said that he counted all things as refuse that he might gain Christ (Phil. 3:8). In this universe full of vanity, there are some true things. The true things in this universe are the processed Triune God and His New Testament economy, the all-inclusive Christ, and the organic church, the organic Body of Christ. In the universe of vanity these are the true things. We need to hold to these true things in love, that we may grow up into Christ. The content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the processed Triune God Himself. The content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God, but the very God in His Trinity processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. We have to hold to the processed Triune God and His New Testament economy, which is the dispensation (arrangement) of God&rsquo;s hidden mystery (Eph. 3:9) to have a church to be the Body of Christ (Eph. 3:10; 1:23). We also need to hold to the all-inclusive Christ, the One who fills all in all (1:23), whose dimensions are immeasurable (3:18), and whose riches are untraceable (3:8b). Finally, we have to hold to the church, the Body of Christ, an organism (1:23), as the fullness of Christ to be His expression.</p>
<p>If we do not hold to the truth&mdash;the processed Triune God and His New Testament economy, the all-inclusive Christ, and His Body, the organic church&mdash;we cannot grow up into Christ, the Head. Many Christians do not grow in life because they do not know how to hold to these true things, but we need to know how. By holding to these true things in love, we grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things, both small and great things (4:15b). We can grow up into Christ by recognizing the right and authority of Christ as the Head. We are His members under His authority, under His headship. To grow up into the Head, Christ, is to allow Christ to grow and increase in our inward parts. For us to grow up into Christ means that Christ grows in us. Christ should increase, and we should decrease. When we grow in life, this means that we decrease and allow Him to increase. When He increases in us, that is our growth in life. When we have more of Christ wrought into us and interwoven into our being, we are growing in Christ and with Christ.</p>
<p>Our growing into the Head is in the divine life of the processed Triune God. We grow in this divine life until eventually we are a full-grown man (4:13). This full-grown man is not an individual man, but a corporate, universal, great man. When we are a full-grown man, we will have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (4:13). Christ&rsquo;s fullness is His organic Body, the expression of His unsearchable riches. His Body as His fullness has a stature, and this stature has a measure.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:14 says that when we are a full-grown man, we will be no longer babes. To be carried about by any wind of teaching is a strong indication of being babyish. Babes cannot discern what teachings distract them from God&rsquo;s central purpose and what teachings are according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It would be hard for little children to discern the difference between G, C, O, and Q; nor could they discern the difference between I and 1. Much ability is needed to discern things properly. The apostles are those who are qualified by being able to discern the truth. They know how to cut straight the word of the truth with a definite direction for a definite purpose in the way that a carpenter cuts wood straight (2 Tim. 2:15). A carpenter is trained to cut wood in a proper, unbiased way. A sign of being babyish is not being able to discern the truth. An adult can discern the difference between G, C, O, and Q because he is no longer a babe. Are we no longer babes in the spiritual things? If we are no longer babes, we should be able to discern the truth and the teachings that are according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy for the building up of the Body of Christ. For the protection of the babes, a mother always chooses the proper food so that her child will be healthy and will not be poisoned.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Being Joined Together and Knit Together<br />
in the Divine Element</h2>
<p>The Body grows and is built up by being joined together and knit together in the divine element (Eph. 4:16a). The divine element is the element of the processed God, who is embodied in Christ. With such an element we grow up into the Head in all things. After growing up into Him, we issue out from Him the rich supply to the Body. We are joined together through every joint (every gifted person) of the rich supply. This is like the joining together of the frame (the structure) of a building to be one system. Every building has a structure, a frame, and all the parts of this frame, this structure, are joined together to be one system. We are also being knit together through the operation in measure of each one part (each one member of the Body). The knitting together (the interweaving) of all the parts of the building is not only to have the parts joined together but also to have them interwoven for the one Body as a whole. A stone building is put together by the interweaving of the stones. All the pieces of stone are interwoven together, knit together, by being compacted together in a solid way. The joining and the knitting are the real building up. To be joined together and to be knit or interwoven together is to be built together. The joining and the knitting issue in a built up church, a built up Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation of each one part in its measure, the Body of Christ, being joined together and knit together, is built up as a whole, and this is the genuine building of the Body of Christ as an organism. The vision of this organic building will not only cause us to drop the old, traditional way and pick up the new, scriptural way, but it will also revolutionize our entire being. If this building is not realized in my time on this earth, at least this fellowship is in print for future generations. This printed fellowship concerning the building up of the Body of Christ will speak to our generation and to future generations until what is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 is completely fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIRECT BUILDING OF THE ORGANIC BODY<br />
OF CHRIST BY THE BODY ITSELF</h2>
<p>The direct building of the organic Body of Christ is by the Body itself. The Body is built directly by all the members of Christ functioning, each in his own measure, mainly in prophesying&mdash;speaking for the Lord. All of us have a measure, and we can function in our measure. My little finger functions, and I am so happy with its function. Without my little finger, it would be hard for me to take care of the itching within my ear. My little finger really functions in its measure to comfort me. In like manner, all the members of the Body of Christ can function in their own measure. We all function mainly in prophesying, in speaking for the Lord.</p>
<p>I am expecting to see meetings all over the earth in which everyone is speaking Christ, speaking forth Christ, speaking Christ into others in the way of dispensing Christ into others. Then an organism will come into existence which can be seen not only by God but also by all His lovers. This direct building by all the members of Christ takes place through the perfecting work of all the gifted persons under the bountiful supply of the divine element of the ascended Christ in His ascension. We need to practice the fellowship in this book so that we can see the reality of such an organic building on this earth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">A CRUCIAL WORD AND TESTIMONIES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:8-9; 4:1; Acts 20:24; 2 Tim. 4:5; Col. 4:17</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for another meeting. We thank You for Your everlasting mercy, in which we live and in which You have come to us. Lord, we thank You for Yourself, we thank You for being a Spirit, we thank You for Your living word, and we thank You for this present message. Lord, cleanse us. We trust in the cleansing by Your precious blood that You shed for us on the cross. Lord, we thank You for Your anointing. You are the compound, all-inclusive, consummated Spirit who dwells within us. Lord, we thank You for Your presence, and even now we enjoy Your presence and we sense Your presence. Lord, we worship You. We worship the Lord Jesus as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. We thank You for Your speaking, for Your oracle. Thank You that there is an oracle of Yourself today on this earth. Lord, we thank You for Your speaking that is fresh to all of us every day. We believe You will speak to us again in a new way. Lord, let us be met by You, touched by You, nourished by You, strengthened by You, and supplied by You. Thank You for Your bountiful supply that meets all of our needs. Be with us and be one spirit with us in this speaking. Thank You, Lord. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CRUCIAL WORD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Oracle of God</h2>
<p>This chapter is not a continuation of the foregoing chapters. I have a burden in this chapter to meet the need of the present situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need to see something concerning the oracle of God. Some among us have said that it is wrong to listen to one man&rsquo;s speaking. Actually, our words are empty and are not worth listening to. However, in this universe we have One who is real, who is true, who is faithful and holy, who is our life and our light, and who is our love and enjoyment. This One is our speaking God. The Bible tells us that God has spoken (Heb. 1:1-2). He has been speaking from the Old Testament time and today in the New Testament time through all the dispensations and through all the generations. Our God is a living God and a speaking God. We have a living God who is speaking every day. Some of us can testify that we enjoy the real, practical, and genuine speaking of God to us morning by morning. All of us should be able to testify that we enjoy the practical speaking of God to us every week.</p>
<p>How does God speak to us? God is a Spirit. We have a spirit, and God as the Spirit speaks to us in our spirit. Our spirit is the organ through which God speaks to us. God also speaks to us through some channel, and that channel is His word in the Bible. Sometimes when we read the Bible, we hear and receive God&rsquo;s speaking, but many times we do not. The word of God is printed in black and white and is available for everyone to read. However, not everyone at every time hears God&rsquo;s speaking through the channel of His word. If we have a sincere, seeking spirit and if we open to the Lord from the depths of our being as we read the Bible, it will be easy for us to hear God&rsquo;s speaking and receive God&rsquo;s word. God&rsquo;s word will reach us.</p>
<p>We may have heard God&rsquo;s speaking and received God&rsquo;s word, but can we speak something from the Bible in the way of new light? To illustrate what I mean, let us look at 2 Corinthians 3:8-9: &ldquo;How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory? For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.&rdquo; We may read the phrase &ldquo;the ministry of the Spirit&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;the ministry of condemnation&rdquo; many times without receiving new light in God&rsquo;s speaking. Who can tell us what the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of condemnation are? Some of us may be able to answer this question based upon the help that we have received from the Life-study of 1 Corinthians. I told the saints in the 1988 Summer Training on Leviticus that a person could read Leviticus again and again without ever understanding all the significances of the offerings. The messages in that training, however, helped us to understand the real significance of each offering.</p>
 <p>Many of us can testify that the Life-study Messages uncover us, take our veil away, and open up our eyes. The Life-studies help us to go further and see even more. The Bible is a rich, deep, and profound gold mine. There is much gold hidden deep in this mine, and the Life-study Messages open up this mine. They open up the unsearchable Word of God. When we receive such an opener, we have to dig and dig to get the gold in the rich mine of the Bible. Even though I have published Life-study Messages on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, I am still digging in the rich mine of the New Testament. There is an inexhaustible supply of gold there.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:1, Paul said that the apostles have &ldquo;this ministry.&rdquo; A careful reader of the Bible can tell us that &ldquo;this ministry&rdquo; referred to in 4:1 is the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness in 3:8-9. If we do not have the light, all we can say is that this ministry is the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness. This is not the oracle of God because this is only according to our learning from the letter of the Bible. Any good scholar of the Word can read these verses and understand them by his mind in this way. To merely see the facts in the Bible according to the black and white is not God&rsquo;s oracle. God&rsquo;s speaking in His oracle is always with new light, new revelation.</p>
<p>This ministry, which is the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness, is the New Testament ministry, the unique ministry of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This word is the oracle of God. This is not something acquired merely by reading according to the understanding of the mind, but it is by God&rsquo;s enlightenment. The light regarding this ministry is that it is the New Testament ministry that enlivens people, giving people life and dispensing the very Triune God into man&rsquo;s spirit. Second Corinthians 3:9 mentions the ministry of condemnation. The ministry of condemnation is the Old Testament ministry that always condemns people and kills people. This understanding is something from the oracle of God. With God&rsquo;s oracle, there is always the enlightening.</p>
<p>When we listen to the oracle of God, this does not mean that we are listening to a man. We are listening to God in His oracle. I have been ministering in the United States for approximately twenty-six years, and much of my speaking has been printed in books. I would ask the saints who have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for many years who they have been listening to. If you have been listening to a man for many years, you are the most foolish person. Only a fool would listen to a man again and again for such a long period of time. If any of the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would say that he has been listening to a man, this saint is the most foolish person on this earth. To listen to a man is foolish, but to listen to God in His oracle is wise. We come to the ministry meetings in order to listen to God in His oracle. To listen to God in His oracle is to be blessed with the processed Triune God. I heard of someone who repented to God that for the past approximately twenty years he had been listening to a man. If he did listen to a man, he has to confess this as a sin. If we listen to a fallen man as a fallen descendant of Adam, this is surely a sin we have to confess and repent for. However, I think that many of us can testify that we have not been listening to a man but to God in His oracle.</p>
<p>We need to consider the main, new revelations that we have seen in the past twenty-five years through God&rsquo;s oracle. We have seen that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, that the Lord is the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). Before the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States, we had never seen this revelation. Terms such as enjoying Christ, experiencing Christ, and exhibiting Christ were not used by us before the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States. Based upon the biblical revelation, I invented these terms. I even wrote a hymn on exhibiting Christ&mdash;&ldquo;Let us exhibit Christ&rdquo; (#864 in <em>Hymns</em> ).</p>
<p>Another new revelation that we have seen in the past twenty-five years is the sevenfold Spirit of God (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). We have also seen that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). The Lord has opened up to us the matter of pray-reading the Word (Eph. 6:17-18). I invented the word <em>pray-reading</em> to convey the revelation of this fact in the holy Word. Furthermore, we never saw the real significance and the vital importance of calling on the Lord (Rom. 10:12; 2 Tim. 2:22) until the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States.</p>
<p>Another main, new revelation that we have seen in the past twenty-five years is that the all-inclusive Spirit of Christ is the consummation of the processed Triune God (Rom. 8:9; Phil. 1:19b; Matt. 28:19). This revelation came from the very God in His oracle. Does this mean that when you hear this speaking, you are listening to a man? This means that you are listening to our dear, beloved God in His oracle. If you have been listening to God in my speaking, you have been blessed. My speaking of these main, new revelations in the past twenty-five years has been the oracle of God.</p>
<p>Another revelation that we have seen is the dispensing of the processed Triune God into the transformed, tripartite man (Rom. 8). I am so happy that this point has been passed on to all the saints in the local churches. We have also seen the mingling of the processed God with the regenerated and transformed man (John 6:57b; 15:5; 1 John 3:24). Since the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States, we have seen the economy (dispensation) of God (1 Tim. 1:4; Eph. 1:10; 3:9). God in His oracle has also shown us the New Jerusalem as a corporate person composed of all the chosen and redeemed saints of God to be God&rsquo;s tabernacle, His dwelling, and the Lamb&rsquo;s wife, His counterpart (Rev. 21:2-3, 9b-10, 12, 14). Thank the Lord for the main, new revelations that we have seen in the past twenty-five years. We received these revelations from God in His oracle through the speaking of His present ministry. Each one of the main, new revelations that we have seen in the past twenty-five years is the Word of God in the new light. If someone does have the oracle of God, he must have the light.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whoever speaks for God in His oracle has a certain amount of divine authority. There is the deputy authority of God in His oracle.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Unique Ministry<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy<br />
and Many Personal Ministries</h2>
<p>We need to see the truth concerning the unique ministry of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and many personal ministries. God&rsquo;s New Testament ministry is unique, but there are many personal ministries within this unique ministry. Second Corinthians 3:8-9 and 4:1 reveal the unique, New Testament ministry. Acts 20:24 speaks of Paul&rsquo;s ministry. In this verse, he speaks of his desire to finish his course and the ministry which he received from the Lord Jesus. Second Timothy 4:5 shows us that Timothy had a ministry, and Colossians 4:17 shows us that Archippus had a ministry. All of us have our own personal ministry. We can all be perfected to be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. All the ministries, however, must be in the unique ministry of the New Testament. If our ministry is not a part of the ministry of the New Testament, it means nothing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Kinds of Apostles<br />
and Their Relationship with the Elders<br />
and the Churches, and with One Another<br />
among Themselves</h2>
<p>We need to see the truth concerning the kinds of apostles and their relationship with the elders and the churches, and with one another among themselves. In the book entitled <em>A Timely Trumpeting and the Present Need,</em> we pointed out the different kinds of apostles. The first kind of apostle includes those like Peter, John, and Paul who were appointed directly by the Lord and constituted directly through the Lord&rsquo;s revelation. Other brothers like Timothy, Titus, and Silas composed another kind of apostle. They were not made apostles by the Lord directly, nor were they constituted by the Lord&rsquo;s revelation directly. They were produced by the Lord&rsquo;s directly appointed apostles. They were produced apostles, produced by Paul. A certain brother was told that there were seven apostles among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. He went to a brother to get the list of these seven apostles. When I looked at this list and considered the names, I realized that all of the seven were my students. They all learned of me. I am not likening myself to Paul, but the principle is the same. There are apostles who have been appointed directly by the Lord and have been constituted directly through the Lord&rsquo;s revelation, and there are apostles produced by the Lord&rsquo;s directly appointed apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TESTIMONIES CONCERNING<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S UP-TO-DATE MOVE</h2>
<p>Editor&rsquo;s note: The conference in Pasadena concluded with brothers from Brazil, the Philippines, Korea, Taiwan, and the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada giving testimonies concerning the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move. These places have experienced the Lord&rsquo;s blessing as a result of taking the Lord&rsquo;s new way. The brothers in these places testified of their enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in the gospel preaching by visiting people in their homes, in the home meetings and the small group meetings, in the meetings according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, in the practice of prophesying&mdash;speaking for the Lord in the church meetings of mutuality, and in the training for the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move. What follows is an edited report of their testimonies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Brazil</h2>
<p>In Brazil and the rest of South America in 1980, there were only forty-eight churches with about one thousand saints. After taking the Lord&rsquo;s new way, in 1986 there were one hundred thirty churches with five thousand saints. In 1986 ten thousand people were saved and baptized in Brazil through gospel preaching by visiting people in their homes. Today in 1988 there are two hundred and fifty-three churches with ten thousand saints all over South America. The experience of the saints in Brazil testifies that the Lord&rsquo;s new way works.</p><h2 class="head2">The Philippines</h2>
<p>The saints in the Philippines have also seen the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in His up-to-date move among them. The church in Manila was the first church established in the Philippines in 1930 on the northern island of Luzon. By 1984 there were only nine churches on the island. In 1985 the churches began to take the Lord&rsquo;s new way and there was a breakthrough. In that year there was an increase of five churches. In 1986 twelve more churches were raised up, in 987 twenty-four churches were added, and in 1988 there was an increase of fifty-one churches. Now there are one hundred and one churches on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. After the saints began to practice the new way, the number of churches on the island increased by ninety-two within four years. The work in the Philippines also includes the Visayas Islands and the island of Mindanao. Three years ago there were approximately one hundred and forty churches on these islands. Now the churches have increased to about one hundred and ninety-five. Therefore, the total number of churches in the Philippines is now two hundred and ninety-six. Thank the Lord for the increase and spread of the churches in the Philippines as the brothers there follow the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Korea</h2>
<p>The churches in Korea also increased when they began to take the new way. By 1984 there were thirty churches in Korea with about fifteen hundred saints. Now in 1988 there are sixty churches with about five thousand saints. There were about four hundred saints in the church in Seoul with three meeting halls by 1984. Today in Seoul there are about fifteen hundred saints with fifteen meeting halls. Brother Lee visited Korea in November of 1988 and thirty-two hundred saints gathered together for meetings with him. Included in this number were about three hundred pastors from the denominations.</p>
<p>In Korea there are about ten million Christians, who make up around one-fourth of the population. In order to have a breakthrough in such a Christian country, the brothers felt that they needed to saturate the country with the literature of the ministry. They completed the translation of many important books of the ministry along with the entire set of Life-study Messages within five years. In Seoul the brothers are dealing with about forty-two major Christian bookstores and about eight other bookstores in the rest of Korea. Many of the bookstores have a separate section for the Korean Gospel Bookroom, and in some bookstores they have a special section for Brother Witness Lee.</p>
<p>About six hundred pastors have ordered the complete set of Life-study Messages. One renowned Methodist pastor who oversees a congregation of about thirty-five hundred was able to acquire three volumes of Life-study Messages. He finished reading them in two months and began to promote them among his colleagues. In one conference with many denominational leaders, he publicly said that the Life-studies were one of the best publications that he had read concerning the Spirit.</p>
<p>In order to supply the word to more people, the brothers in Korea decided to publish a newspaper. They print about one hundred thousand copies a month. These newspapers include two or three messages by Brother Lee, and they are widely distributed. Korea is being saturated with the truth through the distribution of these publications. The churches are spreading, the number of saints is increasing, and the level of life and enjoyment is rising as the saints in Korea follow the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taiwan</h2>
<p>The church in Taipei has also enjoyed the Lord&rsquo;s blessing by following His up-to-date move to build up the Body of Christ. The brothers have been taking the way of gospel preaching by visiting people in their homes, and they have practiced the home meetings, small group meetings, and district meetings according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26. Before 1984 there were twenty-one halls, and the attendance in the meetings was around three thousand. Today Taipei has twenty-three halls and one hundred and six district meetings with about forty-five hundred saints meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. The number of saints meeting has increased by fifty percent. One particular district only had ten saints in 1984. Now this district has increased to two districts with eighty-four saints. The attendance of the meetings in hall sixteen remained at about one hundred saints for fifteen years until November of 1987. Through visiting people in their homes with the gospel, and through home meetings, small group meetings, and district meetings, the meeting attendance has risen to two hundred and sixty. The brothers in Taipei have testified that they are now beginning to reap the Lord&rsquo;s full blessing after they began to take the new way in 1984.</p>
<p>The brothers have been stressing three points to the saints: to have a daily morning revival by calling on the Lord and pray-reading His Word, to visit the saints in order to nourish and cherish them, and to prepare to prophesy in the church meetings. The saints are encouraged to prepare something to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, of their topmost enjoyment during the week and bring this to share in the district meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. About one-third of the attendants in all of the district meetings combined are now speaking for the Lord by prophesying for three or four minutes each. That means about fifteen hundred saints speak for the Lord every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning.</p>
<p>Before 1984 there were seventy-four churches on the island of Taiwan. Today there are ninety-four churches. The brothers are burdened to gospelize, truthize, and churchize the entire island. They are looking to the Lord to establish churches in the two hundred and twenty-seven remaining localities in Taiwan within the next three years. This gospelization work for the rest of the island will begin in January of next year, 1989.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Great Lakes Region<br />
of the United States and Canada</h2>
<p>The brothers in the Great Lakes region of the United States also testified that the biblical way that the Lord has unveiled to us through His oracle is being worked out there. Two and a half years ago there were about twenty-four churches around the Great Lakes. In the last two years, the Lord has raised up twenty new churches. Now there are forty-four churches in the area of the Great Lakes. Also in the last two years, the Lord has raised up five more churches in Ohio: the church in Cincinnati, the church in Dayton, the church in Toledo, the church in Lorain, and the church in Cleveland Heights. Three couples from Ohio went to Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania four years ago, and now there are five churches in the area of western Pennsylvania. The church in Pittsburgh has about one hundred saints. The Lord&rsquo;s move in Ohio and Pennsylvania is a testimony of the operation of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The brothers in eastern Canada, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, are experiencing the Lord&rsquo;s blessing by standing with the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date speaking in a practical, patient, and exercised way. One brother in the churches there, who was burdened to preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes, was able to baptize about three hundred new ones within one year. Another brother had the burden to contact the Spanish-speaking refugees in his locality in Canada. Although he could not speak Spanish, he contacted them and established home meetings in their homes. Now in his locality, fifty of these Spanish-speaking ones have been added to the church. Three years ago, there were only three churches in eastern Canada with about three hundred saints. Today there are ten churches in eastern Canada with about six hundred and fifty saints. The number of churches has tripled and the number of saints has doubled by the brothers taking the new way. The brothers are very much encouraged to stand one with the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date speaking and to continue in the Lord&rsquo;s new way.</p>
<p>A leading brother from the church in Chicago testified of the importance of the training in the Lord&rsquo;s new way. He felt very privileged to participate in the Full-time Training in Taipei. He said that he considered his forty days in the training as a top experience in his Christian life. He reported that twenty-four other saints from Chicago were able to participate in this training and that this was a very beneficial contribution to the church life in Chicago. He felt that the experience the saints gained in Taipei added tremendously to the burden for the gospel, for the care of others, and for the building up of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. He praised the Lord for what He had accomplished and worked out through this training.</p>
<p>A concluding word from Brother Lee: To follow the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move, there is the need for a revived and overcoming life, for learning, for laboring, and for endeavoring.</p></body></html>
