   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Avoiding Giving Tediously Long Prophecies,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Three to Five Minutes Being Most Fitting</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must avoid giving tediously long prophecies; otherwise, we will occupy too much time and take away the opportunity for others to function.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to our experience, especially in the initial stage of the practice of prophesying, three to five minutes is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Luke 1 and 2 three people prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>None of the three were giving a prediction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not to say that there was no prediction in their speaking but that principally they were prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first to prophesy was Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist; the second, was Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus; and the third, was Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Elizabeth s speaking was the most simple and probably did not exceed two minutes, yet it was an excellent prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mary s speaking was probably about two minutes in length, and Zachariah probably spoke a little longer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His speaking was probably no more than seven minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>None of them spoke in a lengthy way; rather, they were appropriate in speaking the Lord into others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Prophesying requires learning.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, we must learn to be skilled in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to be skilled in God s word, we must be well versed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consider the speaking of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mary s speaking, in particular, was made up of over thirty quotations from the Old Testament; it can be said that her speaking was entirely a composition of quotations from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fact that this young woman was so familiar with the Old Testament and was able to speak according to the Scriptures is a proof that she belonged to a learned family.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s choosing was right.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He chose such a woman to give birth to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Her son James was very pious, and her other son, Jude, was well versed in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Epistles they wrote contain numerous references to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Epistle of James speaks of many things related to the Old Testament, and although Jude s Epistle consists of only one short chapter, it mentions many stories from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This proves that the whole family was familiar with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As far as the Scripture is concerned, they were a well-read family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we desire to learn to prophesy, we need to be well versed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, we need to have experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The words of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah all contain a considerable amount of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Their speaking out of their experience and their applying of God s word produced wonderful prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is amazing that at the beginning of the New Testament, when John and the Lord Jesus were conceived but were not yet born, these three persons prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They did not speak predictions nor did they speak in tongues; rather, they prophesied.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their prophesying was a cooperation between God and man; it was man speaking for God in coordination with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It sets the New Testament principle of speaking for God in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, when we prophesy in the meetings, we need to be familiar with God s written word, include our experience, and have an instant inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we speak in such a way, it is prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to have more practice and learning based on our seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is best if the elders in the various localities are able to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I absolutely believe that Mary, Elizabeth, and Zachariah must have all been full-timers, meaning that they contacted the Holy Scriptures and read God s word all day long, without being distracted by other things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Zachariah was a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A priest should be well versed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he had not been familiar with the Scriptures, he would not have been qualified to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, the words spoken by Elizabeth, Zachariah s wife, and by Mary prove that they too had spent much effort studying the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The elders among us have to hurry to work every day, and after a week of work, they are physically exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fact that they are able to enjoy a verse or two in the Bible every morning is quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, to merely enjoy two verses from the Bible in the morning cannot make them rich in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If they want to have something to share in the meetings, they need to diligently memorize the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They need to be so familiar with these important Epistles that when they open their mouth, they will be able to prophesy as those whose tongue is the pen of a ready writer cf.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Psa 45:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Understanding the Bible and having personal experiences makes prophesying an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Perhaps some may ask, Does this mean that all the brothers and sisters should be full-timers?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, this would be best.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If there were thirty thousand people on the earth doing nothing but studying the Bible every day, it would be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When this group of people would meet together, every one of them would be able to prophesy, and the effect would be immeasurable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today all of Christianity lacks this kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result, all of their meetings involve only one person speaking with everyone else listening.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Consequently, their condition is very poor.</S>
