   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE ANOINTING AND THE CONSCIENCE Scripture Reading: Exodus 30:23-25; 1 John 2:27; 1:7; 3:20-21; Heb 9:14; 10:22; 1 Tim 1:19; Acts 24:16 ABIDING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY TAKING CARE OF THE ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 15:1-8 concerns Christ as the vine and the believers as branches in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the way for us to abide in the vine is not fully developed in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Besides his Gospel, John also wrote three Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his first Epistle John continued to show the way to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to 1 John 2:27, the way to abide in Christ is to take care of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ing in the word anointing indicates that it is something moving and working.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The moving of the ointment in the Bible is called the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we apply an ointment to our skin, we rub it in. Hence, there is a moving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The anointing mentioned in 1 John comes from the holy anointing oil described in Exodus 30:23-25, which was a compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This anointing oil typifies the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The anointing gives us the way to abide in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many branches are attached to a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The branches are not only attached to the vine but also abiding in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The life-juice within the vine flows into the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By this flow the branches abide in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The abiding of the branches in the vine is an illustration of the fellowship mentioned in 1 John 1:7.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fellowship is abiding, and abiding is carried out by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The dictionary tells us that to abide is to remain, indicating that the branches abiding in the vine is simply their remaining in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, in the Bible the word abiding, especially in reference to the branches relationship with the vine, means something more profound than merely to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The secret of our abiding in Christ as the vine is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Gospel of John mentions the abiding 15:4-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the first Epistle of John mentions the anointing, which is the way to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation contains the reaping, the harvest, of the abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The abiding, the way to abide, and the harvest are three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this chapter we will consider mainly the second stage, the way to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Anointing Being the Moving and Working</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>of the Spirit within Us</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way to abide is by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All believers have the Spirit within them, and this Spirit is not silent, passive, or inactive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is very active and aggressive and is constantly moving and working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The moving and working of the Holy Spirit within us is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there is nothing or no one living within us, there will be no moving or working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, every saved person has received the Holy Spirit Rom 8:9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, every believer has the anointing within something living, acting, moving, and working.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s salvation is not merely an objective matter, something outside of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s salvation is subjective; it is a person within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This person is God Himself as the life-giving Spirit within every believer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every one of us has this moving person living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our Experience of the Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before we were saved, we were always alone and lonely, regardless of our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now that we are saved, it is altogether different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Wherever we go, Someone always goes with us, not outwardly but inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We love the Lord, but sometimes our love for Him wanes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although many young brothers and sisters truly love the Lord, they may be attracted when a classmate, relative, or friend invites them to see a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They may pray, Lord, should I go or not?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, they may eventually be so attracted that they tell the Lord, Lord, sorry, just this one time do not go with me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, would You give me leave just for three hours?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let me go to see the movie alone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A sister may see in a newspaper advertisement that a beautiful item is on sale at a department store.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She may be quite attracted by the style as well as the price.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She may have recently received a gift from her grandmother of the exact amount that she needs to buy the item.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a result, she may decide to go and buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When she considers the Lord Jesus, she may say, Lord, excuse me just for this time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please stay home and allow me to go to the store alone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have all done something like this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, regardless of how much we ask the Lord to leave us alone, He will not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He always goes with us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After I was saved as a young person, I sometimes told the Lord, Lord, I loved You yesterday, and I loved You this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, now I am going to a certain place, and I do not want You to come with me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, please stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I was bothered that the Lord would not stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, He always went with me and in me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Moreover, He would ask me, Do you really enjoy your going?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This question from within was the anointing it was a living person moving and working within me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This working and moving, the anointing of the ointment, never leaves us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The ointment, which is the compound Spirit, anoints us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In certain places in the Lord s recovery there has recently been a strange teaching that we can go anywhere because the Lord Jesus is with us wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to this teaching, we can go to worldly places, such as movie theaters, because the Lord will go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord goes with us to such places; however, He goes not to make us happy but to bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Before we were saved, no one bothered us when we went to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, now that we are saved, when we go to see a movie, the Lord Jesus will go with us to bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He may bother us by asking, Are you enjoying the movie?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This inward asking is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Sometimes He says, Do not stay here any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Go home.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many of us have had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>A sister who is shopping in a department store may hear the anointing say, Do not touch that item.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Eventually, she may hear, You should go home.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>After a few such experiences at a certain place, we may decide to never go back to that place.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We may say, Lord Jesus, I will not ask You to leave me.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I will stay with You.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we say this, we will immediately be filled with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Christians often like to gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, every time we gossip, we should sense something bothering us within.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many times when I begin to ask a brother about a certain person or matter, something within checks me, and I cannot continue.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When we have this kind of experience, it is the anointing who stops us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is a wonderful aspect of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are saved from hell once for all, but our salvation in our daily life is not once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We need to be saved every day by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Unbelievers can gossip and talk loosely without any inward problem, but believers cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We are saved from gossiping by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When I begin to speak loosely to my wife, I am often stopped by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When this happens, I go to my study and kneel down to pray, Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The Christian life is a life of being saved by the anointing.</S>
