<h1 class="title">IMPORTANT POINTS<br />
RELATED TO OUR SERVICE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TOUCHING LIFE</h2>
<p>Serving according to right and wrong is a common problem in the church service. As believers and serving ones, we have the Lord as our life. We love the Lord, fear Him, and are being shined upon and taught by Him, but we still have the flesh and our natural disposition. As serving ones, we still have conflicts and disputes because we live in the flesh according to what is right and what is wrong. Living in the realm of right and wrong is not an easy problem to solve. We must know how to deal with this matter before the Lord.</p>
<p>The matter of right and wrong is not related to life; it is related to death, which is the opposite of life. According to the Bible, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was next to the tree of life, and the issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was death (Gen. 2:9, 16-17). Hence, neither good nor evil is related to the tree of life. We often regard evil as being equivalent to death and regard good as being equivalent to life. God&rsquo;s Word, however, reveals that both good and evil are related to death, not life. Both good and evil are death. Thus, touching good or touching evil is the same as touching death.</p>
<p>Man fell because he did not contact the tree of life according to God&rsquo;s desire. Instead, man followed Satan&rsquo;s enticement and contacted the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and this brought in death (vv. 16-17; 3:1-19). Good and evil are the same as right and wrong. Good is the same as right, and evil is the same as wrong. Hence, right and wrong belong to good and evil and bring in death; right and wrong are the opposite of life. If we pay attention to right and wrong, we will touch death and be in death; we will not touch life.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s will is for us to touch life. Satan&rsquo;s scheme is for us to touch right and wrong. The issue of touching life is life, but the issue of touching right and wrong is death. Therefore, when we encounter matters that are related to right and wrong among the saints, we should not try to solve these matters by being in the realm of right and wrong. Instead of paying attention to matters according to right and wrong, we should bring the saints into the light of life in order that they would accept the dealing of life. Right and wrong always cause us to touch death. Even if problems related to right and wrong are seemingly resolved, the issue will always be death. We can touch life only by being in the light of life and by accepting the dealing of life. Life always swallows up death. If we touch life, life will swallow up any death related to right and wrong. This is a clear principle. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, disputes among brothers arise because one brother thinks that he is right and that the other brother is wrong. The brother who thinks that he is right will argue boldly, but the second brother often is not convinced and is not willing to admit that he is wrong. As a consequence, such brothers often bring their argument to the elders. Brother A then accuses Brother B, and Brother B accuses Brother A. How should the elders solve such a problem? If they do not understand spiritual matters or know that right and wrong are the opposite of life, they will touch the realm of right and wrong in hope of solving the problem, but the issue will be death.</p>
<p>If we understand that both right and wrong are the opposite of life, we will not attempt to solve problems that are related to the realm of right and wrong. Instead, we will bring people to the Lord so that they may see whether the Lord within them approves of their dispute. Then it will be easy to lead them to accept the dealings of life in the light of life. When the light of life shines on the saints and when they are dealt with in life, they drop their arguments, their problems are solved, they gain life, and they grow in life.</p>
<p>Here is another example. One day a sister spoke to me about a dispute with her husband. Although both the sister and the brother were good saints, I sympathized with the injustice that she was suffering. According to my natural man, I could have said that her husband was wrong. However, saying this would have been to fall into the realm of right and wrong, without rendering her any spiritual help in life. It is useless to deal with right and wrong, because it does not lead to life. When we touch right and wrong, we fall into the realm of right and wrong, and as a result, everyone involved is brought into death.</p>
<p>In order to help this sister, I said, &ldquo;Sister, from what you have spoken, I could say that you are right. But the Lord does not want me to say that you are right and that your husband is wrong. Rather, He wants me to ask if your dispute with your husband is of the Holy Spirit and spiritual or if it is of the flesh and fleshly? Did the Lord want you to quarrel with your husband, or was that your decision? Have you brought this situation to the Lord in prayer? Have you asked the Lord whether He is pleased with your quarreling and whether He supports you? You have told me the details of your quarrel, but have you told the Lord, and have you asked Him what He would say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her countenance changed, and she said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I have not prayed since the day that I quarreled with my husband, and I have even been unable to pray. I know that this is wrong and not pleasing to the Lord, but I am a human being. How can I admit defeat? He is wrong. Even though I do not feel peaceful when I quarrel, how can I not quarrel? What should I do?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I cannot judge matters according to right and wrong, and I cannot offer you words based on right and wrong. You have an inward sense from the Lord, and He is operating in you to make known what pleases Him. You should submit to Him because of His love for you.&rdquo; Then her whole being relaxed, and I prayed with her to bring her to the Lord.</p>
<p>She prayed with tears, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I do not feel that I am wrong before my husband, but I feel that I am wrong before You. I sensed from You that I should not quarrel with my husband, but I acted contrary to Your sense. Please forgive me.&rdquo; In her prayer she touched the Lord, and life swallowed up death. The problem was over. She realized that even if her husband was wrong, she should not quarrel with him. She also realized that this situation was for her to learn lessons before the Lord.</p>
<p>Through our fellowship this sister was brought to the Lord in the light of life, and she touched life. We should not touch matters in the realm of right and wrong. The evil one deceived this sister so that she touched the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and she was damaged by death. Under the Lord&rsquo;s blood she was led to touch the tree of life. The Lord&rsquo;s life supplied her, reigned in her, and operated in her to swallow up death. Thus, she was able not only to stop quarreling but also to be filled with Christ, filled with life. Even her husband was moved to go to the Lord in prayer, to confess his sins, to meet Him, to touch life, and to admit his wrongdoing to his wife. Their problem was solved, and they were filled with the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This is the issue of touching life instead of touching right and wrong.</p>
<p>We often think that we can solve the problems among the saints if we can determine who is right and who is wrong. This may solve a dispute, but it will not help the saints to know their flesh, nor will it lead them to accept the Lord&rsquo;s dealing and touch His life so that they may grow spiritually. Both our rationalizations and our flesh are involved with right and wrong. Right and wrong are always related to our fallen nature. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He brought people to God. He did not answer questions based on right and wrong. When a person meets God, he can recognize right and wrong, transcend right and wrong, conquer right and wrong, and experience life swallowing up right and wrong. The Lord does not want to solve problems in the realm of right and wrong. He wants to swallow up right and wrong with His transcending life.</p>
<p>We must avoid touching right and wrong with the saints. Instead, we should bring them to the Lord so that they may receive help in life. Our natural man loves to judge matters according to right and wrong. This is a problem especially with sisters. Instead of listening to a message, sisters often prefer to listen to those who are talking in the back row. This is a preference of the human flesh. Hence, the responsible ones in the churches should condemn and reject matters that are related to right and wrong. When we know matters related to right and wrong, it is easy to fall into this realm, and the result will be death. We must remember that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is Satan&rsquo;s goal, but the tree of life is God&rsquo;s goal. We should never touch good and evil or right and wrong. We should touch life.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
