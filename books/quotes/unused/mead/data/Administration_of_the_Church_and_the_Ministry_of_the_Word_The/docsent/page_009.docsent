   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Serving with a Burden</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have a good order in our service, but we are lacking in burden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having a burden means that we have a goal which we must reach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have not reached our goal or are unable to produce the expected result, we should be concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are able to serve, even though there is no result, we do not have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This attitude indicates a lack of burden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our speaking should never fall into this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the brothers who minister the word must bear a heavy burden before the Lord, having no peace to rest or eat and even troubling others so that they also have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This can be compared to the city of Jerusalem having no peace when the Lord Jesus was born Matt 2:1-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who speak for the Lord must have a feeling to trouble the saints to the point that they have no peace inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they have no peace, we can have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The saints cannot love the world and love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They must not be lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who serve the Lord need to have this kind of burden.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many serve as employees in a big company.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They work a fixed number of hours every day and simply do the tasks that are assigned to them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not make big mistakes and are not concerned whether the company makes a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are employees without a burden; they serve without a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we make no profit on the first day of our business, we should be concerned about our livelihood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the serving brothers, whether they serve in the children s work or the young people s work, have this kind of consciousness, they will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Complaining that we fail because we are weak shows that we lack a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every serving one must be burdened to the extent that he feels responsible if the work does not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He should be like a businessman who thinks of his business even in his sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Discerning between the Service of Responsibility and the Service of Burden</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The elders in all the churches must come before the Lord to receive a burden and to see if all the home meetings in their localities are satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must have a concern for the condition of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Are they strong or weak, living or dead, rich or poor?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot remain unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps those responsible for the home meetings are at peace, but the elders should not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elders should coordinate together and not act individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They should bear a corporate burden to completely change the condition of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They need to pray for the saints, even with tears, and seek the Lord for the proper words to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then they should speak in the meetings according to their burden until the saints become uneasy within and are not content with their present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a speaking by the elders is not according to arrangement but according to burden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The elders should have a burden; they should not merely bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As elders, we should not simply fellowship and discuss the condition of the different home meetings, visit them, and give an evaluation report at the next elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no burden in such a practice; it will be ineffective and not result in any profit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we have a company with many employees, its yearly earnings will not be influenced by discussions, reports, and evaluations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These do not carry out the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have a real burden, we will set a goal for our yearly profit, work toward this goal, and be determined to reach it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both in the administration of the church and in the ministry of the word, the brothers are commendable in their bearing of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, they lack a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without a burden, all our activity will be dead and ineffective; with a burden, we will be living and flourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such an outcome is not related to our method but to our person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Serving with a Burden</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Causing the Self to Be Dealt With</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Children will never be successful in their studies if they study only for their tests.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If they have a burden, their studying will change.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A brother may give a message merely out of obligation, because it is his turn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, giving messages is not a matter of obligation but of burden.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may speak for half a year, but those who listen might not receive anything, and our speaking will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have a burden, we will see that our messages are ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our messages should trouble people so that they have no peace and stir them up to love and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this situation, our being will be touched by God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is no need for the self to be dealt with if we give messages that are out of obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, in giving a message out of a burden, our self must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Working from nine to six as an employee is a matter of obligation and does not require any dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, we would work differently if we had our own business.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our laziness would be dealt with because we would rise earlier to work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The attitude of a waiter or clerk toward customers might not need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, a person who owns his shop will adjust himself in order not to offend his customers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead of being dealt with, some brothers seem to have more problems because they serve out of obligation, not burden.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If there is a burden, our self decreases and is dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It will not increase, because there are things that our burden will not allow us to do, and there are areas that will require our being dealt with before we can release our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, having a burden deals with us the most.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A young man who is not burdened with a family can be carefree in his living.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, after he is married and has children, he will know the meaning of being diligent and disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A child can spend his parents money freely without self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But when he is older and lives on his own, his spending is budgeted.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He will be more careful when he goes shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Spending his parents money was one thing, but spending his own money is a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It seems as if the brothers in the churches serve according to obligation as employees in a company.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They do not seem to have much burden.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such service is dangerous and will cause us to lose the Lord s presence.</S>
