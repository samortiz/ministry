   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 To Offer to God His Only Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whom He Loves</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 2 God said to Abraham, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God told Abraham to offer Isaac, his only son whom he loved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How hard it must have been for Abraham to do this!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we had been he, we would have said, "Lord, I am more than a hundred twenty years of age, and Sarah is about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can You ask me to offer back to You what You have given me?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have not had this experience, you will have it some day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can testify that quite a number of times in the past God asked us to give back to Him what He had given us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The gifts, power, work, and success which He gives us must be offered back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a real test.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It would have been easy for Abraham to give up Lot or Eliezer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even casting out Ishmael was not that difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But for him to offer his only son whom he loved was a very difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day, after our having a good enjoyment of the Lord, He will ask us to give back to Him the gift, work, or success He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He may say, "Now is the time for Me to ask you for something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I don't ask you to work for Me or to go to the mission field.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I ask you to offer back what I have given you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the way we all must take today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>a A Life Grown Up by the Well of the Oath</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>with the Calling on the Name of the Eternal God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God did not tell Abraham to offer up a baby or even a little boy, but a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaac's life was a life grown up by the well of the oath with the calling on the name of the Eternal God 21:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Genesis 21:34, the last verse of chapter twenty-one, says, "Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that Abraham remained there for a good number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During that time, Isaac grew up by the well of Beer-sheba, growing up by a life of planting and calling on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The one whom Abraham was told to offer up was a grown-up son, one who had lived with him in a life of planting and calling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The life in Beer-sheba built Isaac up to be a burnt offering, not an archer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>b Offered to God on Mount Moriah</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Where God's Temple Was Built</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God told Abraham to offer Isaac, He told him to go to the land of Moriah and to offer him upon one of the mountains there v. 2 . The land of Moriah was a two-day journey from Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mountain on which Isaac was offered was later called Mount Moriah, eventually becoming Mount Zion, the place where the temple was built 2 Chron 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I read 22:2 as a youth, I was bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I wondered why God was so troublesome, saying, "Lord, You gave Abraham a son and asked him to offer his son back to You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That was all right, but it was not reasonable for him to go to such a far-off place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Aren't You omnipresent?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Were You not there in Beer-sheba?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why did You ask Abraham to journey to a mountain so far away?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At first, God did not even tell Abraham on which mountain he was to offer Isaac, saying only that it would be "one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In asking Abraham to journey far away for the offering of Isaac, God was not being troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is never troublesome; He is always meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually Mount Moriah became the center of the good land, and Abraham's descendants had to go to that mountain three times a year to offer the burnt offering to God Deut 16:16; Psa 132:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, we see that chapter twenty-two of Genesis is a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot and should not offer to God the burnt offering which He desires in the place of our choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must leave our place and go to the place of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ishmael, the archer, the bowman, went southward toward Egypt and married an Egyptian woman.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But Isaac, the burnt offering, was a different kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He did not go downward to Egypt; he went upward to Moriah.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you consult a map, you will see that Moriah is north from Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we have a picture of two types of persons an archer and a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Which will you be?</S>
