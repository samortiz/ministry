<h1 class="title">The Dispensing of Christ<br />
for the Gradual Building Up of His Body<br />
and the Transmitting of Christ<br />
for the Sudden Raising Up of God&rsquo;s Churches</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:4-23</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The dispensing of Christ to dispense all the riches of the embodied Divine Trinity (Col. 2:9) into His believers is for the gradual building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:4-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of God the Father&rsquo;s dispensing, speaking forth God&rsquo;s eternal purpose:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We were chosen by God the Father to be holy&mdash;v. 4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This is for us to partake of God the Father&rsquo;s holy nature to be made the same as God in nature&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; Rom. 15:16; cf. Rev. 21:2.</li>
			<li>This is to be sanctified, separated from all things as God is and saturated with God&mdash;Rom. 15:16; cf. Rev. 21:2:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) We need to love God and not love the world (1 John 2:15), being separated from the world by God&rsquo;s word of truth (John 17:14-19; Eph. 5:26), not being fashioned according to this age (Rom. 12:2a).</li>
				<li>2) We need to present ourselves to God to be saturated by God with the element of His holy nature (Rom. 6:19) unto the eternal life (v. 22) to be renewed by the Spirit for our transformation into the image of Christ (Titus 3:5b; Rom. 12:2b; 2 Cor. 3:18).</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We were predestinated by God the Father unto sonship&mdash;Eph. 1:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This is to have God the Father&rsquo;s life (John 3:16), being made God&rsquo;s children, the same as God in life by being born of God after God&rsquo;s kind through regeneration (1:12-13; 1 Pet. 1:3).</li>
			<li>This is for our being &ldquo;sonized&rdquo; with God the Father&rsquo;s life in our entire tripartite being&mdash; 1 John 5:11-12; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11; 1 John 3:2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God the Father chose us to be holy by predestinating us unto sonship&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This is the divine sanctification for the divine sonship as the center of the divine economy and the central thought of the revelation in the New Testament&mdash;Heb. 2:10-11; 1 Thes. 5:23; Rev. 21:2, 7.</li>
			<li>In order to be sanctified for sonship, we must care for the sanctifying Spirit speaking and working in our spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:4, 6; 15:16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of God the Son&rsquo;s dispensing, speaking forth the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Eph. 1:7-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We were redeemed by God in and unto Christ, who is the element of the Divine Trinity; Christ&rsquo;s being the element means that He is for dispensing to accomplish God&rsquo;s economy to head up all things in Christ&mdash;vv. 7, 10.</li>
		<li>This heading up takes place by Him, as the element of the entire Divine Trinity, dispensing Himself into us for the building up of His Body; when the Body is built up, Christ is the Head in actuality&mdash; vv. 10, 22-23.</li>
		<li>The Son&rsquo;s dispensing in His redemption transforms God&rsquo;s chosen people with Christ as the element of life into a treasure for them to become God&rsquo;s inheritance, His private and personal possession&mdash;v. 11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ is the issue of God the Spirit&rsquo;s dispensing, speaking forth the application of God&rsquo;s accomplished purpose&mdash;vv. 13-14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit&rsquo;s sealing saturates us continuously unto the redemption of our body&mdash;v. 13; 4:30:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This sealing transforms us into a treasure to God as His inheritance&mdash;1:18; cf. 2 Cor. 4:7; Eph. 3:8.</li>
			<li>The more we are sealed, the more we bear the image of God&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18b; Col. 3:10; cf. 2 Cor. 3:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Spirit&rsquo;s pledging guarantees that God is our inheritance&mdash;Eph. 1:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Spirit is the pledge, the foretaste, the sample, of what we will inherit of God in full&mdash; 1 Pet. 2:3; Psa. 34:8.</li>
			<li>This pledging is unto the redemption of our body as God&rsquo;s acquired possession&mdash;Rom. 8:23.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The transmitting of Christ is for the sudden raising up of God&rsquo;s churches&mdash;Eph. 1:19-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see the fourfold surpassing greatness of God&rsquo;s power&mdash;resurrecting power, ascending power, subjecting power, and heading-up power&mdash;v. 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ overcame four layers of opposition by transcending through Hades, the earth, the air, and even the third heaven&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Acts 2:24; Eph. 1:21; Heb. 4:14; 7:26.</li>
		<li>Christ transcended far above all the layers of trouble to transmit not only His authority but also His transcending power to the church that the church may be formed&mdash;Eph. 1:19, 22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The sudden raising up of God&rsquo;s churches over the whole earth is because of the transmission of the transcending Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fine dispensing in the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with us constitutes the Body of Christ, whereas His transmitting brings forth the Body of Christ:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ as the Spirit of life is gradually dispensing Himself as the element of God&rsquo;s riches for the growth, the building up, of the Body.</li>
			<li>Christ as the Spirit of power is striking suddenly to raise up the churches of God for the spread, the increase, of the Body.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>His transmission is like that of a rushing violent wind to set up the churches, which are the Body of Christ&mdash;Acts 2:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>On the day of Pentecost, such a step was taken by the ascended Christ to have a sudden &ldquo;strike&rdquo; among the human race&mdash;vv. 1-11, 16-21, 41-47.</li>
			<li>This sudden &ldquo;striking&rdquo; brings the churches into being and makes them transcendent over all the four layers of persons, matters, and things which oppose the raising up of God&rsquo;s churches&mdash; cf. 4:19-31.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Since the transcending Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, His transcending transmission includes all the rich threefold dispensing of the Triune God&mdash;Eph. 3:20-21; Phil. 4:13.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Economy of the Fullness of the Times<br />
to Head Up All Things in Christ through the Church</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:3-10, 22-23;<br />
Rev. 21:1-2, 23-25; 22:1-2a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s eternal intention is to head up all things in Christ, who has been appointed to be the universal Head&mdash;Eph. 1:10, 22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose that in the economy of the fullness of the times, He might head up all things in Christ&mdash;v. 10.</li>
	<li>Through the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth; this will be God&rsquo;s eternal administration and economy&mdash;Rev. 21:1-2.</li>
	<li>God has blessed us, chosen us, predestinated us, redeemed us, forgiven us, and graced us for the purpose of heading up all things in Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:3-10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Satan&rsquo;s goal is to corrupt God&rsquo;s creation and to cause confusion&mdash;Rom. 8:19-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When Satan injected himself into man, Satan became death and darkness to man; sin brings in death, death brings in darkness, and darkness brings in confusion.</li>
	<li>The entire universe is a heap of collapse caused by Satan injecting himself as the factor of death into God&rsquo;s creation&mdash;Heb. 2:14; Rom. 8:20-21.</li>
	<li>God is working to liberate His creation from bondage and to bring it into liberty by heading up all things in Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:22, 10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We all need to be delivered from the heap of collapse and to be headed up in Christ&mdash;Col. 1:12-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The collapse of the universe caused by the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man gives God an excellent opportunity to manifest His wisdom&mdash;Eph. 1:8; 3:10; Rom. 11:33.</li>
	<li>According to the Bible, God&rsquo;s salvation is to save us not only from our fallen, sinful condition but also from the heap of collapse&mdash;Eph. 2:1-8, 21-22.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God is heading up His chosen ones to be the Body of Christ with Christ as the Head&mdash;1:4, 22-23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first step in the heading up of all things in Christ is for God to bring His chosen ones, His sons, out of the universal collapse and to place them under the headship of Christ&mdash;1:22; 4:15; 5:23; Col. 1:18; 2:10, 19.</li>
	<li>When the church takes the lead to be headed up in Christ, God has a way to head up all other things&mdash; Eph. 1:22-23, 10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is the vessel used by God to solve His problems and to fulfill His purpose, which is to manifest Himself through man by mingling Himself with man&mdash;3:9-11.</li>
		<li>Eventually, the Body with Christ as the Head will be the universal Head over all things&mdash;1:22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church life is a life of being headed up&mdash;4:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Himself into man and to work Himself into man&mdash;3:9, 16-17a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Christ God has come to work Himself into man&mdash;not into man as originally created by Him but into the man into whom Satan has injected himself.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s purpose with the church is to work Himself into us as life that we may be full of light&mdash;5:8-9.</li>
	<li>We need the element of God to be wrought into our being&mdash;3:16-17a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God is working Himself into His chosen ones through an administration which is a sweet dispensing, an intimate stewardship, a comfortable household arrangement&mdash;1:10; 3:2; 1 Tim. 1:4; 3:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The heading up of all things in Christ does not take place by a governmental administration; rather, it comes about by an intimate stewardship, by a comfortable household arrangement&mdash;Eph. 3:2.</li>
	<li>The way to behave in God&rsquo;s house is to have a pleasant household administration, an intimate stewardship, and to dispense Christ to all the members of God&rsquo;s household&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15; 1:4.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s abounding grace will accomplish the heading up of all things in Christ; this abounding grace is working on us so that all things might be headed up in Christ&mdash; Eph. 1:7-8, 10.</li>
	<li>The more we, God&rsquo;s inheritance, are saturated with the Spirit as a living seal, the more heading up there will be in the universe&mdash;vv. 11, 13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The heading up in the church life is by life and light&mdash;John 1:4; 8:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s way of recovery is Christ versus Satan, life versus death, light versus darkness, and order versus confusion.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s way to recover the oneness among His creation is to impart Himself into us as life&mdash;Rom. 8:6, 10-11, 19-21.</li>
	<li>In order to be delivered from the heap of collapse in a practical way, we need to grow in life; the more we grow in life, the more we will be headed up and the more we will be rescued from the universal collapse&mdash; Eph. 4:15; Col. 2:19.</li>
	<li>When God comes into us as life, the light of life shines within us&mdash;John 1:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This life swallows death, and this light dispels the darkness&mdash;8:12.</li>
		<li>If we are in the life and under the light, we will be delivered out of confusion and brought into order, harmony, and oneness.</li>
		<li>When we are full of Christ as life, we are under the light and are controlled by the power of light.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center, all things will be headed up in Christ; this will be the complete fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10&mdash;Rev. 21:2-3, 23-25; 22:1-2a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the New Jerusalem everything will be saturated with life and will be under light&mdash;22:1; 21:23.</li>
	<li>In Revelation 21 we see the Head, the Body surrounding the Head, and all the nations walking in the light of the city; the whole universe will be headed up in the light shown through the transparent city&mdash;v. 18.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Vision of the New Man as the Masterpiece of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26; Eph. 2:14-16; 4:22-24</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His creation of man was to have a corporate man to express Him and to represent Him&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Eph. 2:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God created man in His own image for His expression and gave man His dominion that man would represent Him to deal with His enemy&mdash;Gen. 1:26.</li>
	<li>The church as the new man in the new creation bears God&rsquo;s image for God&rsquo;s expression and fights against God&rsquo;s enemy for God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;Col. 3:10-11; Eph. 2:15; 4:24; 6:10-20.</li>
	<li>What was divided and scattered in the old man is recovered in the new man&mdash;Gen. 11:5-9; Acts 2:5-12; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The new man as the poem, the masterpiece, of God was created through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross&mdash; Eph. 2:10, 15-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to pay careful attention to two phrases in verse 15: <em>in His flesh</em> and <em>in Himself:</em>
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;In His flesh&rdquo; Christ terminated all the negative things in the universe (Satan, the devil, the enemy of God&mdash;Heb. 2:14; sin&mdash;Rom. 8:3; John 1:29; the flesh of fallen man&mdash;Gal. 5:24; the world, the cosmos, the evil system of Satan&mdash;John 12:31; the old creation represented by the old man&mdash;Rom. 6:6; and the separating ordinances of the law&mdash;Eph. 2:15).</li>
		<li>&ldquo;In Himself&rdquo; as the sphere, element, and essence, Christ created the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere in which and the element and essence with which the new man was created.</li>
			<li>He is the very element and essence of the one new man, making God&rsquo;s divine nature one entity with humanity&mdash;cf. Col. 3:10-11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the creating of the new man, first our natural man was crucified by Christ, and then through the crossing out of the old man, Christ imparted the divine element into us, causing us to become a new entity, a new invention of God&mdash;Rom. 6:6; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>On the cross Christ created the new man in Himself by abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, the middle wall of partition&mdash; Eph. 2:14-15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The law spoken of in 2:15 is not the law of the moral commandments but the law of the ritual commandments, such as the ordinances of circumcision, keeping the Sabbath, and eating certain foods.</li>
	<li>Ordinances are the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and division:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On the cross Christ abolished all the regulations regarding living and worship, regulations that have divided the nations&mdash;v. 15; Col. 2:14.</li>
		<li>From the time of Babel, mankind has been divided by ordinances concerning the ways of living and worship; in God&rsquo;s economy in the church life, we must overcome Babel&mdash;Gen. 11:1-9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ should be our only source; we should not allow anything of our background, culture, or nationality to be our source&mdash;cf. Col. 3:10-11.</li>
			<li>The worldly people regard cultural differences as a source of prestige, but in Christ we have lost this prestige; now our only prestige is Christ and the genuine oneness.</li>
			<li>If we are willing to let go of our cultural pride, it will be possible for the Lord to have the proper church life.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the one new man, Christ is all the members and is in all the members&mdash;Col. 3:10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Christ who dwells in us is the constituent of the one new man&mdash;1:27; 3:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because Christ is all the members of the new man, there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person (for any race, nationality, culture, or social status) in the new man&mdash;vv. 10-11.</li>
		<li>No matter what kind of person we may be, as far as the one new man is concerned, we all are nobodies.</li>
		<li>In the one new man there is only one person&mdash;the all-inclusive Christ&mdash;2:17; 3:4, 11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the new man we all need to take Christ as our person&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 3:17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; as the one new man, the church needs Christ as its person.</li>
		<li>Christ is in all of us as one person; therefore, we all have only one person&mdash;Gal. 2:20; Eph. 3:17a.</li>
		<li>For the practical existence of the one new man, the total person of the old man must be put away, and we must live by our new person&mdash;Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:22, 24; 3:17a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We need to live a life in the new man by taking Christ as our person, with Him as the One making all the decisions in us.</li>
			<li>Once we see that we are a part of the one new man, we will not be able to decide things merely by ourselves.</li>
			<li>We need to see that we are a corporate Body and a corporate new man and that both our living (person) and our moving (life) are corporate&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We need to consider <em>one new man</em> in Ephesians 2:15 together with <em>one mouth</em> in Romans 15:6 and <em>speak the same thing</em> in 1 Corinthians 1:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the past there were too many mouths because there were too many persons.</li>
			<li><em>With one accord</em> and <em>with one mouth</em> (Rom. 15:6) mean that even though we are many and all are speaking, we <em>all speak the same thing</em> (1 Cor. 1:10).</li>
			<li>Although we are many and come from many places, we all have one mouth and we all speak the same thing; this is because we all are the one new man having only one person&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 4:22-24; 3:17a; Rom. 15:6; 1 Cor. 1:10.</li>

the Living of the New Man</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:13, 15, 20-32; Rom. 12:2; Col. 3:10-11</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Christ created the one new man on the cross, but the believers need to partake of this creation by putting off the old man and putting on the new man through renewing&mdash;Eph. 2:15-16; 4:22-24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because the new man was created with us who belong to the old creation, he needs to be renewed; this renewing takes place mainly in our mind&mdash;Col. 3:10; Eph. 4:23.</li>
	<li>When the new creation took place in our spirit at the time of regeneration, the Holy Spirit with the divine life was added into our being&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; John 3:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This addition of the Spirit and the divine life produced a new being, a new man&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 4:24.</li>
		<li>The regeneration of our spirit was actually the creation of the new man; therefore, in our spirit the new man has already been created.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Although our spirit has been regenerated, our soul with its faculties of mind, will, and emotion remains in the old creation and still needs to be renewed&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Newness is God; thus, to become new is to become God&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		<li>The renewing Spirit imparts the divine essence of the new man into our being to make us a new creation&mdash;Titus 3:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When the life-giving Spirit, who is mingled with our regenerated human spirit, spreads into our mind, this mingled spirit becomes the spirit of our mind; it is by this mingled spirit that our mind is renewed&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 4:23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By the spirit of the mind, we are renewed to fulfill in experience what was accomplished in the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man&mdash;vv. 22, 24.</li>
		<li>To be renewed in the spirit of our mind is inward and intrinsic; this renewing revolutionizes our logic, philosophy, thought, concept, and psychology&mdash;Rom. 12:2.</li>
		<li>In order for the one new man to come into full existence, we must experience a thorough renewal of our mind, which has been built up according to our nationality and culture.</li>
		<li>When our mind has been renewed, the one new man will come into existence in a practical way, and Christ will be all and in all&mdash;Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 4 is a chapter that speaks of the perfecting of the new man through the growth of life:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The new man created by Christ must be perfected in order to function.</li>
	<li>In Ephesians 2:15 we see the creation of the new man organically; in 4:13-16 we see the perfecting of the new man in relation to his function.</li>
	<li>The organically perfect new man needs to be perfected through the growth of life in order to function in a proper way&mdash;vv. 13, 15, 24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is through the growth in life that the new man comes into function.</li>
		<li>The more the new man grows through receiving the proper nourishment, the more he will function normally.</li>
		<li>The growth into Christ in verse 15 equals the putting on of the new man in verse 24; the more we grow into Christ, the more we put on the new man.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would be perfected for the practical existence of the one new man, we need to be constituted with Christ&mdash;3:17a.</li>
	<li>In order for the new man to grow, we need to experience the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and descending Christ so that the all-inclusive Christ is wrought into us to be our everything; then the organically perfect new man will become perfect functionally.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The living of the new man should be exactly the same as the living of Jesus; the way Jesus lived on earth is the way the new man should live today&mdash; 4:20-21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we are renewed in the spirit of our mind to execute the fact of having put off the old man and having put on the new man, we live a life that corresponds to the life of Jesus, a life according to the reality that is in Jesus:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus lived a life in which He did everything in God, with God, and for God; God was in His living, and He was one with God.</li>
		<li>For us to live a life according to the reality that is in Jesus means that we learn Christ and are taught in Him to live a life of reality, a life in the shining of light and in the expression of God&mdash;vv. 20-21; Matt. 11:29.</li>
		<li>The life of the new man must be that of the reality in Jesus; as a corporate person, the new man should live a life as Jesus did, a life of reality expressing God and causing God to be realized by man.</li>
		<li>Our standard of living must be according to the reality in Jesus, the reality lived out by Jesus when He was on earth; hence, the life of Jesus should be our life today in the church.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church life is the daily living of the new man in the new nature and in the new manner of life&mdash;Eph. 4:24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The new man is the practical church life, which is Christ as the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit in a corporate way:

His Eternal Economy</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:3-5, 8-11; 1 Cor. 1:30</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is His eternal economy, His administrative plan, to distribute Himself into His chosen people to make them the same as He is in life and nature but not in the Godhead for His enlarged and expanded expression&mdash;Eph. 3:2, 8-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The forty-two chapters of the book of Job leave us with a twofold question concerning the purpose of God in creating man and the purpose of God in dealing with His chosen people&mdash;1:1; 10:13; 13:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The great answer to this great question is the eternal economy of God, which is God&rsquo;s eternal intention with His heart&rsquo;s desire to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity as the Father in the Son by the Spirit into His chosen people to be their life and nature that they may become the same as He is for His fullness, His expression&mdash;Eph. 3:9; Gen. 1:26; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; Eph. 1:22-23; 3:19.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with His lovers, even in the way of loss, is that they may gain Him to the fullest extent, that He might be expressed through them for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose in His creation of man&mdash;Rom. 8:28-29; 2 Cor. 4:16; cf. Jer. 48:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention in His creation of all things, including man, was that man would be mingled with God to produce the church as the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem for His glorious expression&mdash;Zech. 12:1; Rev. 4:11; 19:7; 21:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church as the mystery of Christ was hidden in God, who created all things, throughout the ages&mdash; Eph. 3:4, 9; Col. 2:2; 1:27; 1 Tim. 3:16.</li>
		<li>The church, something particular hidden in God as a mystery, which was not made known to men in other generations, has been revealed to the apostles and prophets in their spirit by revelation in the New Testament age&mdash;Eph. 3:3-5; 1:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>By the dispensing of Christ, as wisdom to us from God, into our entire tripartite being, we become constituted with Him to be the church as the wise exhibition of all that Christ is&mdash;1 Cor. 1:24, 30; Eph. 3:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in our salvation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is our righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God, that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life&mdash;Rom. 5:18; 8:10.</li>
		<li>Christ is our sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with His divine life&mdash;6:19, 22; 8:6.</li>
		<li>Christ is our redemption (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body, by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness&mdash;v. 23; Phil. 3:21.</li>
		<li>It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;organically one with Christ and makes Christ everything to us&mdash;1 John 3:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When God&rsquo;s chosen people partake of and enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ, they are constituted with those riches to be the church, through which God&rsquo;s multifarious wisdom is made known to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies&mdash;Eph. 3:8, 10.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, the purpose of eternity, according to the desire of His heart, is to have the church to be the organic Body of Christ for the manifestation of His multifarious wisdom&mdash;1:9-11, 22-23; 3:9-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church as the Body of Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, His eternal economy; the church is the goal of God and the target of the enemy&mdash;vv. 4, 9-11; Matt. 16:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Body is the intrinsic significance of the church&mdash; Eph. 1:22-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body of Christ is the organic essence of the church, just as apples are the organic essence of an apple tree as the frame.</li>
		<li>The Body of Christ is the divine constitution of the Triune God with the believers in Christ&mdash;4:4-6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church as the Body of Christ is the unique means used by God to fulfill His purpose and settle all His problems&mdash;cf. Gen. 1:26:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church in the economy of God is for the expression, the glory, of God the Father in the divine sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and nature&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5; John 17:22-24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Father imparts His holy nature into us to make us as holy as He is to be the holy city&mdash; 2 Pet. 1:4; 1 Pet. 1:15-16; Heb. 2:10-11; Rev. 21:2.</li>
			<li>The Father imparts His divine life into us to make us His sons, having Christ as our life, that we may grow in this life unto the maturity of life to be the city of life&mdash;Eph. 4:15-16; Heb. 6:1; Rev. 22:1-2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The church in the economy of God is God&rsquo;s greatest boast in making known to the angelic rulers and authorities His multifarious wisdom for the shame and defeat of His enemy to bring in His kingdom&mdash; Eph. 3:10; Rom. 16:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Only through problems can all the aspects of God&rsquo;s wisdom be manifested&mdash;cf. Gen. 1:1-3; 2 Cor. 4:6; Rom. 11:30-36.</li>
			<li>Even our failures, mistakes, defeats, and wrongdoings have given God opportunities to display His wisdom&mdash;cf. Psa. 51; John 18:17, 25, 27.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The church in the economy of God is for the heading up of all things in Christ through the working of Himself into us as life that we may be full of light&mdash;Eph. 1:10, 22-23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When we enjoy Christ as life, the church is built up by this life, and we are under the control of the light of life for our oneness under Christ&rsquo;s headship&mdash;4:15; John 8:12; Col. 1:13.</li>
			<li>When everything is headed up in Christ, there will be absolute peace and harmony (Isa. 2:4; 11:6; 55:12; Psa. 96:12-13), a full rescue out of the heap of the universal collapse.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:14-21</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything so that we may take Him as our person, live Him, and express Him; this is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart and the focal point of the Bible&mdash;Eph. 1:9; 3:11; Phil. 1:20-21a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy according to His heart&rsquo;s desire is to build Himself into man and to build man into Himself&mdash;2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Eph. 3:17a.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s unique work, His central work, is to work Himself in Christ into His chosen people, making Himself one with them&mdash;Gal. 4:19.</li>
	<li>We need God to build Himself in Christ into our humanity, working Himself into us as our life, our nature, and our person&mdash;Eph. 3:17a.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention is to work Christ into us as the Spirit, that Christ may be expressed through His Body and head up the whole universe under His headship&mdash; vv. 16-19; 1:22-23, 10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 1:15-23 Paul&rsquo;s prayer is for the saints to receive revelation concerning the church; in 3:14-21 his prayer is for the saints to experience Christ for the church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The spirit in 1:17 is for revelation, whereas the inner man in 3:16 is for experience.</li>
	<li>In 3:16 our spirit is a person, the inner man, for us to experience Christ for the church; by this person we can experience Christ that the church may be built up.</li>
	<li>As a person, our spirit is for us to live by and experience what we have seen.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to experience Christ in a subjective way, we need to be strengthened with power into the inner man&mdash;v. 16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The inner man is our regenerated spirit with God&rsquo;s life as its life.</li>
	<li>We need to be strengthened into the inner man with the power that raised Christ from the dead, that seated Him in the heavenlies, that subjected all things under His feet, and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church&mdash;1:19-22.</li>
	<li>The more we are strengthened into the inner man, the more the parts of our inner being are brought back into our inner man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul prayed that we would be strengthened into the inner man with the result that Christ could make His home in our hearts and thereby occupy, possess, permeate, and saturate our whole inner being with Himself&mdash;3:17a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since our heart is the totality of our inward parts, the center of our inward being, and our representative with regard to our inclination, affection, delight, and desire, when Christ makes His home in our hearts, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself.</li>
	<li>The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in us and makes His home in us, occupying every part of our inner being, possessing all these parts, and saturating them with Himself.</li>
	<li>In order for the revelation in Ephesians 2 concerning the new man to be practical in our daily life, we need to let Christ make His home in our hearts.</li>
	<li>For Christ to make His home in our hearts means that He is transmitted into us in a full way&mdash;1:22.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When Christ spreads into our hearts, He becomes our person&mdash;3:17a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to take Christ not only as life in our spirit but also as the person in our hearts.</li>
	<li>The only way for Christ to be our person is for Him to make His home in our hearts.</li>
	<li>If we take Christ as our person, allowing Him to spread into our hearts, the person living in our hearts will not be the self but Christ&mdash;Gal. 2:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Christ who is making His home in our hearts is an unlimited, immeasurable Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As Christ makes His home in our hearts, we apprehend with all the saints the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth; these are the dimensions of the universe, the dimensions of the immeasurable Christ.</li>
	<li>Although Christ is immeasurable, He is nevertheless making His home in our hearts.</li>
	<li>Christ is the universal cube, and our experience of Him in the Body must be &ldquo;cubical,&rdquo; three-dimensional.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When Christ makes His home in our hearts, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God&mdash;v. 19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fullness of God is the Body of Christ as the expression of the Triune God to the uttermost, the ultimate consummation of the corporate expression of the Triune God.</li>
	<li>The Body of Christ is the unlimited expression of the unlimited Christ.</li>
	<li>If we let Christ make His home in our hearts, we will be filled with the Triune God to such an extent that we will become His full expression.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The genuine church life is the issue of the unlimited and immeasurable Christ personally making His home in our hearts&mdash;v. 17a; 4:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The content of the church is the Christ whom we take as our person, the Christ who is wrought into our being.</li>
	<li>If we would have the reality of the Body of Christ, we must allow Christ to make His home in our hearts.</li>
	<li>In order for Christ&rsquo;s word in Matthew 16:18 concerning the building up of the church to be fulfilled, the church must enter into a state where many saints allow Christ to make His home in their hearts, possessing, occupying, and saturating their entire inner being.</li>
	<li>The more Christ occupies our inner being, the more we will be able to be built up with others in the Body&mdash; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:16.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Intrinsic Constitution and<br />
the Genuine Oneness of the Body of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals the intrinsic constitution of the Body of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The intrinsic constitution of the Body of Christ is the union, mingling, and incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with a group of tripartite men whom He has redeemed judicially and saved organically&mdash;vv. 4-6; Rom. 5:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The believers who are redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed by God are this divine-human constitution&rsquo;s outward framework.</li>
		<li>The processed and consummated Triune God is this divine-human constitution&rsquo;s inward source, element, and essence&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Father of the Triune God is the source of the inward element&mdash;v. 6.</li>
			<li>The Son of the Triune God is the inward element itself&mdash;v. 5.</li>
			<li>The Spirit of the Triune God is the essence of the inward element&mdash;v. 4.</li>
			<li>All three are dispensed, transfused, and built into God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed believers.</li>
			<li>These believers and the redeeming and transforming Triune God are constituted into one entity as the organic Body of Christ, being God yet man and man yet God&mdash;vv. 3-4a.</li>
			<li>These four&mdash;the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and man&mdash;blended and built together become the Body of Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The intrinsic constitution of the Body of Christ is a hybrid entity of divinity united, mingled, and incorporated with humanity:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Triune God, who possesses divinity with humanity, is united, mingled, and incorporated with the tripartite man, who possesses humanity with divinity&mdash;Rom. 8:6, 10-11.</li>
		<li>Divinity is begotten in humanity, living in humanity, expressed in humanity, and constituted into humanity to be man&rsquo;s dwelling place; humanity is begotten of divinity, living by divinity, expressing divinity, and built into divinity to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15b-16; John 15:5; Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Spirit as the essence of the Triune God is the essence of the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The essence of the Body of Christ, containing the divinity of the Triune God, has the capacity to supply the divine life&mdash;Phil. 1:19.</li>
		<li>The essence of the Body of Christ, containing the excelling humanity of Jesus, has the capacity to supply this excelling humanity&mdash;Acts 16:7.</li>
		<li>The essence of the Body of Christ, containing the all-inclusive death of Christ, has the capacity to put to death the negative things&mdash;Rom. 8:13b.</li>
		<li>The essence of the Body of Christ, containing the surpassing resurrection of Christ, has the surpassing capacity of resurrection&mdash;Phil. 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Spirit as the reality of the Triune God is the reality of the Body of Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reality of the processed Triune God is the consummated Spirit of reality&mdash;John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6.</li>
		<li>The Spirit of reality makes everything of the processed Triune God a reality in the Body of Christ&mdash; John 16:13-15.</li>
		<li>Without the Spirit there is no Body of Christ, no church&mdash;Eph. 4:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 4:4-6 reveals the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The aspiration of the Lord&rsquo;s desire for this genuine oneness became His specific prayer before He went to the cross&mdash;John 17:2, 6, 11b, 14-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This prayer reveals that the Triune God is one, and that oneness of coinherence is a model of the oneness of the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 11, 21.</li>
		<li>The oneness of the Body of Christ is the enlarged oneness of the Divine Trinity&mdash;vv. 22-23; 14:20; 1 Cor. 12:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The processed and consummated Triune God mingles Himself with His chosen people in their humanity, and this mingling is the genuine oneness; because it is such a mingling, the Body itself is the oneness&mdash;Eph. 4:4; Rom. 12:5.</li>
	<li>This oneness is composed of four factors by two means with one goal:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The three of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are three divine factors of this oneness, and these three divine factors are mingled with one human factor, consummating in the Body:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The oneness is composed of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God as its four factors&mdash;Eph. 4:4-6.</li>
			<li>The mingling of these four factors is the oneness of the Spirit&mdash;v. 3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The one faith and one baptism are the two means to accomplish this oneness&mdash;v. 5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Faith is the means for the Body to be joined to Christ the Head.</li>
			<li>Baptism is the means for the Body to be separated from Adam, the old head.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The oneness of the Spirit has the one hope of our calling as the goal; this goal is for the Body to be brought into the divine glory of the processed Triune God, who is mingled with the Body&mdash;v. 4; Col. 1:27; Phil. 3:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>This oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, must be kept diligently by all the believers in Christ with the transformed human virtues strengthened and enriched by and with the divine attributes&mdash;Eph. 4:1-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself who is in our spirit&mdash;v. 3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the uniting Spirit there is the humanity of Jesus, in whom these transformed virtues are found&mdash; Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
		<li>In the church life, what is required is virtue, which is much higher than the morality in human society&mdash;cf. Gen. 2:9; Matt. 5:40-42, 48; 6:6.</li>
		<li>If we act apart from the Spirit, we are divisive and lose the oneness&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 1:10; 2:14-15; 3:1.</li>
		<li>If we stay in the life-giving Spirit, we keep the oneness of the Spirit&mdash;cf. John 4:24; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The keeping of the oneness of the Spirit, the oneness in actuality, is the one accord; this is so that we may arrive at the oneness in practicality, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God&mdash; Psa. 133; Eph. 4:13.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ is by the giving, the dispensing, of the divine grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ&mdash; Eph. 4:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Every member of the Body of Christ is an indispensable gift to the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 12:14-22; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
	<li>The gift of Christ is a person constituted with Christ&rsquo;s life and element dispensed into him by the Divine Trinity&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 1:15.</li>
	<li>Each gifted person has a measure, and the divine grace is given, dispensed, into him according to that measure&mdash;Eph. 4:16; cf. Rom. 12:3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ is by the giving of the gifted persons, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, who are constituted in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, by Christ as the Head in His ascension (including His resurrection), to the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:8-12; Acts 2:24, 27; 1:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ephesians 4:8 says, &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men&rdquo;:
		<ol class="decimal">

		<li>Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had won the victory (Num. 10:35); this portrays how Christ has won the victory and ascended triumphantly to the heavens.</li>
		<li>Through His universal traffic and in His ascension, Christ led as captives those who had been taken captive by Satan and made them gifts to His Body&mdash; Eph. 4:8-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The redeemed saints had been taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection&mdash;cf. Luke 4:18.</li>
			<li>In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself&mdash;Psa. 68:18.</li>
			<li>In His ascension Christ led them to the heavens as His captives in His train of vanquished foes and made them gifts to His Body.</li>
			<li>Now Christ is celebrating His triumph over them, His vanquished foes, and leading them as His captives in a triumphal procession in His move for His ministry to build up His Body&mdash; 2 Cor. 2:14.</li>

	<li>The more Christ ascends and descends within us, capturing and vanquishing us, the more He fills us with Himself to constitute us as gifts to His Body&mdash; cf. Eph. 4:8-10.</li>

<li>The intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ is by the gifted persons&rsquo; perfecting of the saints in the divine dispensing, that all the saints may be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ&mdash; vv. 11-12:

		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The apostles perfect the saints by visiting the churches (Acts 15:36, 40-41; 20:20, 31), by writing epistles to the churches (Col. 4:16; 1 Cor. 1:2), and by assigning their co-workers to stay in certain places to perfect the saints (1 Tim. 1:3-4; 3:15; Titus 1:5).</li>
		<li>The prophets perfect the saints by teaching them to speak the Lord into people, by speaking in the meetings to set up a model, and by helping the saints to live a prophesying life by being revived every morning and overcoming every day&mdash;Acts 13:1; 1 Cor. 14:31; Prov. 4:18.</li>
		<li>The evangelists perfect the saints by stirring them up to be burning in the gospel-preaching spirit, by teaching them with the gospel truths, by training them to preach the gospel, by helping the saints to be equipped with the power of the economical Spirit, and by setting an example of loving the sinners and praying for them&mdash;2 Tim. 4:5.</li>
		<li>The shepherd-teachers perfect the saints by shepherding&mdash;feeding and nourishing the young saints and teaching the growing saints&mdash;Acts 11:25-26; 13:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The result of this perfecting is that we will all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&mdash;Eph. 4:13; cf. John 17:23.</li>
	<li>This perfecting will cause us to be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a satanic system of error&mdash;Eph. 4:14.</li>

	<li>Out from the Head, in the divine dispensing, all the Body is joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together, interwoven, through the operation in measure of each one part&mdash; Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>The joints supplying and the parts functioning cause the growth of the Body, in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, unto the building up of the Body itself in the divine love&mdash;v. 16:
		<ol class="decimal">

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s good pleasure is to be one with man and to make man the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9.</li>
<li>As the children of God, we are God-men, born of God, possessing the life and nature of God, and belonging to the species of God&mdash;Eph. 5:1; 1 John 3:1; John 1:12-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is our real, genuine, Father, and we are His real, genuine, children&mdash;1 John 3:1; Eph. 5:1.</li>
	<li>The greatest wonder in the universe is that human beings could be begotten of God and that sinners could be made children of God&mdash;1 John 3:1, 9; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18; John 1:12-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through such an amazing divine birth we have received the divine life, the eternal life, as the divine seed sown into our being&mdash;1 John 1:2; 3:9.</li>
		<li>Since we have been born of the divine life and possess the divine life, we, the children of God, are divine persons&mdash;5:11-13; 3:1, 10.</li>
		<li>As those who have been born of God, we have not only the divine life but also the divine nature&mdash; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because we are the children of God with the life and nature of God, we can be imitators of God&mdash;Eph. 5:1.</li>
	<li>As the Father&rsquo;s children, having the Father&rsquo;s life and nature, we can be perfect as our Father is perfect&mdash; Matt. 5:48.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As the children of God, we should walk in love and light&mdash;Eph. 5:2, 8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As grace and truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light are the basic elements of Paul&rsquo;s exhortation in 5:1-33:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace; truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of truth&mdash;1 John 4:8; 1:5.</li>
		<li>Love is the inner substance of God, and light is the expressed element of God; the inner love of God is sensible, and the outer light of God is visible.</li>
		<li>Our daily walk as children of God should be constituted with both the loving substance of God and the shining element of God; this should be the inner source of our walk.</li>
		<li>Walking in love and light is deeper and more tender than living according to truth and by grace.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor&rdquo;&mdash;Eph. 5:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To walk in love is to walk in intimacy with God&mdash;cf. 1 John 3:1:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the Father&rsquo;s presence, we not only enjoy grace, the expression of love, but we also enjoy love itself.</li>
			<li>In our daily walk we should always care for our Father&rsquo;s feeling, for we live intimately in His tender love.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The goal of the book of Ephesians is to bring us into love as the inner substance of God that we may enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine love and thereby love others as Christ did&mdash;5:25:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the condition and atmosphere of love, we are saturated with God to be holy and without blemish before Him&mdash;1:4.</li>
			<li>The love in which we are rooted for growth and grounded for building is the divine love realized and experienced by us in a practical way&mdash;3:17.</li>
			<li>The love of Christ, which is Christ Himself, is immeasurable and knowledge-surpassing, yet we can know it by experiencing it&mdash;v. 19.</li>
			<li>In the love of God in Christ, we hold to truth, that is, to Christ with His Body&mdash;4:15.</li>
			<li>The Body of Christ builds itself up in love; love is the most excellent way for us to be anything and to do anything for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash;v. 16; 1 Cor. 12:31.</li>
			<li>To love the Lord in incorruptibility means to love Him in the new creation and according to all the incorruptible things revealed in the book of Ephesians&mdash;6:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As those who have been regenerated to become God&rsquo;s species, we, the children of God, should be love because God is love; since we become God in life and in nature, we also should become love&mdash; 1 John 4:8, 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;You were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light&rdquo;&mdash;Eph. 5:8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As God is light, so we, the children of God, are children of light&mdash;1 John 1:5; Eph. 5:8; John 12:36.</li>
		<li>We are not only children of light&mdash;we are light itself; we are light because we are one with God in the Lord&mdash;Matt. 5:14; 1 John 1:5.</li>
		<li>When we are in the light, we are outside the realm of right and wrong&mdash;v. 7.</li>
		<li>If we walk as children of light, we will bear the fruit described in Ephesians 5:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in expression, that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk.</li>
			<li>The fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light; therefore, goodness in verse 9 refers to God the Father&mdash;Matt. 19:17.</li>
				<li>2) Righteousness refers to God the Son, for Christ came to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose according to God&rsquo;s righteous procedure&mdash; Rom. 5:17-18, 21.</li>
				<li>3) Truth, the expression of the fruit of the light, refers to God the Spirit, for He is the Spirit of reality&mdash;John 14:17; 16:13.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The proof that we are walking as children of light is seen in the bearing of such fruit.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Great Mystery of Christ and the Church</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:18-25; Eph. 5:23-32</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Christ and the church are a great mystery&mdash;Eph. 5:32; cf. 1 Tim. 3:15-16a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God&mdash;Col. 2:2.</li>
	<li>Christ also is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:4.</li>
	<li>Christ and the church as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), typified by a husband and wife as one flesh (Eph. 5:29-31), are the great mystery.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 5 reveals that the first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, presents a significant and complete picture, a mysterious type, of Christ and the church&mdash;Gen. 2:21-24; Eph. 5:23-32:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Adam is a type of God in Christ as our Husband, who is seeking a wife for Himself&mdash;Rom. 5:14; John 3:29; Matt. 9:14-15; 2 Cor. 11:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Just as it was not good for man to be alone, it was not good for God to be alone, showing that God needed to have a complement, a counterpart&mdash;Gen. 2:18-20; Isa. 54:5.</li>
		<li>A husband and a wife as a complete unit are a marvelous picture of Christ and the church as one entity&mdash;Gen. 5:2; Eph. 5:28-32.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Ephesians 5:25-27 reveals Christ in three stages so that the church may be produced and built up to become His bride; this is seen typologically with Adam and Eve in Genesis 2:18-25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the past, the incarnated Christ, the last Adam, died on the cross as our loving Redeemer in accomplishing God&rsquo;s judicial redemption for the purchasing of the church&mdash;Eph. 5:25; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Heb. 9:22; Acts 20:28:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God becoming man, the last Adam, was typified by the creation of man, the first Adam&mdash;Gen. 1:26; John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			<li>God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; his sleep is a type of Christ&rsquo;s death (Gen. 2:21; 1 Cor. 15:18; 1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-14) for producing the church through the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s judicial redemption, which includes:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The forgiveness of sins&mdash;Luke 24:47.</li>
				<li>2) The washing away of sins&mdash;Heb. 1:3.</li>
				<li>3) Justification by God&mdash;Rom. 3:24-25.</li>
				<li>4) Reconciliation to God&mdash;5:10a.</li>
				<li>5) Positional sanctification unto God&mdash;Heb. 13:12.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the present, Christ as the sanctifying life-giving Spirit is saturating us for our organic salvation with Himself as the flowing, divine, unbreakable life for the building of the church as the real Eve&mdash; Eph. 5:26; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 5:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s pierced side was prefigured by Adam&rsquo;s opened side, out from which Eve was produced&mdash;Gen. 2:21-22; John 19:34:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The blood out of the Lord&rsquo;s side was for purchasing the church; the water out of His side is the flow of His divine life, which produces, builds up, and prepares the church to be His bride&mdash;Zech. 13:1.</li>
				<li>2) The rib out of Adam&rsquo;s side typifies the unbreakable resurrection life that is signified by the water flowing out of Christ&rsquo;s side&mdash;Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4; John 19:31-33.</li>
				<li>3) Just as God built a woman with the rib of Adam, God builds up the church with the resurrection life of Christ&mdash;Gen. 2:22; Matt. 16:18.</li>
				<li>4) This life flows within us, transforms us, and builds us up to be the bride of Christ, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate Eve&mdash;Rev. 21:2.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-22); it has the same life and nature as Christ and becomes one with Him as His counterpart, even as Eve became one flesh with Adam (v. 24):
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Only that which came out of Adam could return to Adam as his counterpart; in like manner, only that which comes out of Christ can return to Christ to be His bride&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
				<li>2) The church is a pure product out of Christ; the church is a part of Christ and is nothing less than Christ Himself&mdash;cf. Eph. 5:28-30.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The church is being beautified through the process of sanctification by Christ as the life-giving Spirit cleansing us by the washing of the water as the flowing life of God in the word&mdash; v. 26:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) The cleansing by the washing of the water of life is in the word of Christ; this indicates that in the word of Christ is the water of life.</li>
				<li>2) The Greek word rendered &ldquo;word&rdquo; in verse 26 is not <em>logos,</em> the constant word, but <em>rhema,</em> which denotes the instant word, the word the Lord presently speaks to us.</li>
				<li>3) Christ&rsquo;s speaking is the Spirit; it is the very presence of the life-giving Spirit&mdash;John 6:63; Eph. 6:17.</li>
				<li>4) The indwelling Christ as the life-giving Spirit is always speaking an instant, present, living word to metabolically cleanse away the old and replace it with the new, causing an inward transformation.</li>
				<li>5) Through such a washing process, we are saturated with Christ and transformed by Christ to be His holy, beautiful, God-expressing bride, a bride without blemish or imperfection&mdash;Rev. 19:7; cf. S. S. 6:13; 8:13-14.</li>
				</ol></li>
				</ol></li>
		<li>In the future, Christ as the holy Bridegroom will present us to Himself as His counterpart for His marriage just as God presented Eve to Adam as his counterpart for his marriage&mdash;Eph. 5:27, 31-32; Gen. 2:22-24; Rev. 19:7-9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Ephesians 5:27 reveals the beauty of the bride, saying that Christ will &ldquo;present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>The beauty of the bride comes from the very Christ who is wrought into the church and who is then expressed through the church&mdash;Rev. 19:7.</li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is for the preparation of the bride of Christ, who is composed of all His overcomers&mdash;vv. 7-9; Gen. 2:22; Matt. 16:18.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:10-20</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals that the church as the new man is a corporate warrior fighting against the enemy of God for God&rsquo;s kingdom:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church as the one new man is the corporate man in God&rsquo;s intention, and this new man will fulfill the twofold purpose of expressing God and dealing with God&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;Gen. 1:26.</li>
	<li>The spiritual significance of the victory of Israel over Jericho by their bearing the ark is that it is a picture of a corporate God-man&mdash;God and man as one person&mdash; Josh. 6:1-16.</li>
	<li>Not only must God&rsquo;s eternal purpose be fulfilled and the desire of Christ&rsquo;s heart be satisfied, but God&rsquo;s enemy must be defeated; for this, the church must be a warrior.</li>
	<li>Our walk is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose, our living is for the satisfaction of Christ, and our warfare is for the defeat of God&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;Eph. 4:1; 5:2, 8; 6:10-11.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Spiritual warfare is necessary because Satan&rsquo;s will is in conflict with God&rsquo;s will&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9, 11; Matt. 6:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In addition to God&rsquo;s intention, God&rsquo;s will, there is a second intention, a second will, for the satanic will is set against the divine will&mdash;Isa. 14:12-14.</li>
	<li>All warfare has its source in the conflict between Satan&rsquo;s will and God&rsquo;s will.</li>
	<li>Spiritual warfare is the warfare between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan; in order for the kingdom of the heavens to be established, there is the need of spiritual fighting&mdash;Matt. 12:26, 28; Rev. 12:11.</li>
	<li>We walk according to truth and by grace, we live in love and light, and we fight to subdue the satanic will&mdash;Eph. 4:1; 5:2, 8; 6:12.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To deal with God&rsquo;s enemy, we need to be empowered with the greatness of the power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavenlies, far above all the evil spirits in the air&mdash;v. 10; 1:19-22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fact that we need to be empowered in the Lord indicates that in ourselves we cannot fight the spiritual warfare against Satan and his evil kingdom; we can fight only in the Lord and in the might of His strength.</li>
	<li>The charge to be empowered implies the need to exercise our will; if we would be empowered for spiritual warfare, our will must be strong and exercised&mdash;S. S. 4:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The warfare between the church and Satan is a battle between us who love the Lord and who are in His church and the evil powers in the heavenlies&mdash; Eph. 6:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The principalities, the authorities, and the world-rulers of darkness are the rebellious angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God and who now rule in the heavenlies over the nations of the world&mdash;Col. 1:13; Dan. 10:20.</li>
	<li>We need to realize that our warfare is not against human beings but against the evil spirits, the evil powers, in the heavenlies.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter; it is a matter of the Body, the new man&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 4:24; 6:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers together make up this corporate warrior; after we have been formed corporately into an army, we will be able to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s strategy is to use the church as His army to fight against the enemy; Satan&rsquo;s strategy is to isolate us from the church as God&rsquo;s army.</li>
	<li>The whole armor of God is for the Body, not for individuals; only the corporate warrior can wear the whole armor of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To fight the spiritual warfare, we need to put on the whole armor of God&mdash;vv. 11, 13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God in Christ as the reality in our living is the girdle that strengthens our whole being for the spiritual warfare&mdash;v. 14a.</li>
	<li>The breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience and guards us from Satan&rsquo;s accusations is Christ as our righteousness&mdash;v. 14b; 1 Cor. 1:30.</li>
	<li>Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and with the saints; this peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand against the enemy&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 6:15.</li>
	<li>Faith is a shield against the flaming darts of the enemy; Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith&mdash;v. 16; Heb. 12:2.</li>
	<li>The helmet of salvation that covers our mind is the saving Christ we experience in our daily life&mdash;Eph. 6:17a; John 16:33.</li>
	<li>The sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, is our offensive weapon with which we cut the enemy to pieces&mdash;Eph. 6:17b.</li>
	<li>Prayer is the unique, crucial, and vital means by which we apply the whole armor of God, making every item of the armor available to us in a practical way&mdash;v. 18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>By putting on the whole armor of God, we are able to stand against the stratagems, the evil plans, of the devil&mdash;vv. 11, 13-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To sit with Christ is to participate in all His accomplishments, to walk in His Body is to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, and to stand in His power is to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy&mdash;2:6; 4:1; 5:2, 8; 6:11, 13-14.</li>
	<li>In fighting against the enemy, the most important thing is to stand; having done all, we need to stand to the end.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;We all need to see that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we are on a battlefield.

<h1 class="title">The Divine Trinity and the Divine Dispensing</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:3-14; 2:18; 3:16-19;<br />
4:4-6; 5:19-20; 6:10-11, 17</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The revelation concerning the Triune God in the holy Word is not for doctrinal understanding but for the dispensing of God in His Divine Trinity into His chosen and redeemed people for their experience and enjoyment&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It is impossible for us to know the Triune God merely by doctrine; however, we can know Him by experiencing and enjoying Him&mdash;1 Pet. 1:2; Rev. 1:4-5.</li>
	<li>The Bible reveals that the Triune God is not merely the object of our faith; He is subjective to us, dwelling in us to be our life and life supply&mdash;Rom. 8:11.</li>
	<li>If we would understand the Divine Trinity, we must be in the process of the growth in life, in the line of life pursuing the growth in life&mdash;1 John 2:12-14.</li>
	<li>The Bible was written according to the governing principle of the Triune God working Himself into His chosen and redeemed people as their life and life supply&mdash;Psa. 36:8-9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Trinity is the framework of the entire Bible; the whole Bible, especially the book of Ephesians, is constructed with the Trinity:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Ephesians is the only book in the Bible in which every chapter is structured with the Divine Trinity as its basic element.</li>
	<li>If we do not know the Triune God, we cannot comprehend the profoundness of Ephesians, because every chapter of this book has the Divine Trinity as its framework&mdash;1:3-14; 2:18; 3:16-17a; 4:4-6; 5:19-20; 6:10-11, 17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The revelation in Ephesians concerning the producing, existing, growing, building up, and fighting of the church as the Body of Christ is composed of the divine economy, the dispensing of the Triune God into the members of the Body of Christ; thus, the crucial focus of Ephesians is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Chapter one unveils how God the Father chose and predestinated the members in eternity, God the Son redeemed them, and God the Spirit sealed them as a pledge, thus imparting Himself into His believers for the formation of the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&mdash; vv. 3-14, 18-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A fundamental truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;has wrought Himself into us through the Father&rsquo;s predestination, the Son&rsquo;s redemption, and the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging.</li>
		<li>The Body of Christ comes into being by the dispensing of the Triune God as the life and life supply into the believers.</li>
		<li>The threefold mentioning of the praise of God&rsquo;s glory signifies the threefold dispensing of the Triune God&mdash;vv. 6, 12, 14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Chapter two shows us that in the Divine Trinity all the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, have access unto God the Father through God the Son, in God the Spirit&mdash;v. 18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through God the Son, who is the Accomplisher, the means, and in God the Spirit, who is the Executor, the application, we have access unto God the Father, who is the Originator, the source of our enjoyment.</li>
		<li>We are a poem written by the dispensing of the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow&mdash;v. 10.</li>
		<li>The Father&rsquo;s dispensing to produce the masterpiece, the Son&rsquo;s dispensing to produce the new man, and the Spirit&rsquo;s bringing us to the Father in one Body result in the building up of the church and the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;vv. 10, 15-16, 21-22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In chapter three the apostle prays that God the Father will grant the believers to be strengthened through God the Spirit into their inner man so that Christ, God the Son, may make His home in their hearts, that they might be filled unto all the fullness of God&mdash;vv. 16-19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Father is the source, the Spirit is the means, the Son is the object, and the fullness of the Triune God is the issue.</li>
		<li>Each of the three does not act for Himself but for the fullness of the Triune God; this is a beautiful picture of the Divine Trinity.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Chapter four portrays how the processed God as the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father is mingled with the Body of Christ so that all the members of the Body may experience the Divine Trinity&mdash;vv. 4-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body of Christ is the sphere for the development of the Triune God.</li>
		<li>The divine dispensing of God the Father in His being over all, of the Son in His being through all, and of the Spirit in His being in all enables all the members of the Body of Christ to experience and enjoy the Triune God.</li>
		<li>These verses reveal four persons&mdash;the one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God the Father&mdash; mingled together as one entity to be the organic Body of Christ; thus, the Triune God and the Body are four-in-one.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Chapter five exhorts the believers to praise the Lord, God the Son, with the songs of God the Spirit, and give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Son, to God the Father&mdash;vv. 19-20:
