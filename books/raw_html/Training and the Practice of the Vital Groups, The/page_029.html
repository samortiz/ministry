<h1 class=series>THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIX</h1><h1 class=title>BUILDING UP A HABIT OF CONTACTING PEOPLE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 9:16-27; 1 Tim. 1:16</h1><h2 class=head1>OUR BURDEN IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>I treasure 1 Corinthians 9:16-27. This is the top portion in the Bible concerning our burden in preaching the gospel. I would like us to read these verses with much consideration.<h2 class=head2>Entrusted with a Stewardship</h2><p>Paul said, “For if I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel. If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship” (vv. 16-17). Paul had a burden and a responsibility. Preaching the gospel was not his boast but his duty. The Lord entrusted Paul with a stewardship and established him as a steward. The Greek word for stewardship is oikonomia, which is also the word for economy. Paul dispensed all the riches which he had received of the Lord to the needy ones in order to fulfill his stewardship.<h2 class=head2>Becoming All Things to All Men</h2><p>Verses 18 and 19 say, “What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may present the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel. For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more.” Paul enslaved himself to all the needy ones that he might gain them. Verses 20 through 22 say, “And to the Jews I became as a Jew in order that I might gain Jews; to those under law, as under law (though I myself am not under law), that I might gain those under law. To those without law, as without law (though I am not without law to God but within law to Christ), that I might gain those without law. To the weak I became weak that I might gain the weak. To all men I have become all things that I might by all means save some.” Paul became all things to all men. To the weak ones he became a weak one. He adapted himself to all things, that is, to different ways of eating and practice, for the sake of all men.<h2 class=head2>Partaking of the Gospel</h2><p>Verse 23 says, “And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it.” How much we enjoy partaking of the gospel depends upon how much we share it with others. If we do not preach the gospel, we will have no enjoyment in the gospel. If we do not preach the gospel, we cannot partake of the gospel we have received. To receive the gospel is by faith, but to enjoy the gospel is by preaching. We have to preach the gospel to enjoy it. The more we preach, the more we enjoy. If we do not preach and do not bear any fruit, we are through in the enjoyment of the gospel.
