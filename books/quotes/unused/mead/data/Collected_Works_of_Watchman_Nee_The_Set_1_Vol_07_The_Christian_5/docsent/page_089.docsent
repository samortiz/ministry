   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOTES FROM MY BIBLE 1 Issue No. 5 ACTS 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 4:"But the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word "divided" here is the same as the word "divided" used in Luke 12:51-53.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 5:"And when a hostile attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to treat the apostles outrageously and to stone them..."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Positionally, the Jews considered the Gentiles as dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How high was the middle wall of partition!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet in persecuting the saints, how much are they in oneness!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The devil has his kind of oneness also!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verses 6-7:"They became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And there they announced the gospel."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They were not running away, but were preaching the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 10:"Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And he leaped up and began to walk."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostle's speaking with a loud voice was a fulfillment of the Lord's word: "Whoever...believes that what he says happens, he will have it" Mark 11:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 15:"And saying, Men, why are you doing these things?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also are men of like feeling as you, and announce the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"We also are men" we should remember this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, preachers should not be worshipped by others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Unfortunately, many have forgotten that they are men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 19:"But Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, supposing that he was dead."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The zeal of the messengers of Satan can almost be compared to that of the apostles!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before "they stoned," did they not try to offer sacrifices to the apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we go along with men's opinion and follow their way to worship God, there will not be any persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Men love those who are willing to accept praises!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we reject the praises, "they stoned"!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 20:"But as the disciples surrounded him, he rose up and entered into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the Lord's word was persecuted, it could still rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the past twenty centuries, many times the world has thought that "he was dead"!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 22:"Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Them" in this verse refers to the saved believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The meaning of "enter" is to gain, and "the kingdom of God" means to reign with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Must" here points out that this is the only pathway, and "through many tribulations" speaks of the condition for reigning with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word "many" means that it is not a one-time thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 27:"And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared the things that God had done with them and that He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was God's work, not their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who testify should remember this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"He had opened a door."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They had suffered for the purpose that others may enter through this door.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>ACTS 15</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 2:"And when no little dissension and discussion with them came about through Paul and Barnabas, the brothers directed Paul and Barnabas and certain others among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They had "dissension and discussion," because this was related to the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 3:"They therefore, having been sent forward by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail about the turning of the Gentiles; and they brought great joy to all the brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was "joy" and not "jealousy."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 4:"And when they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared the things that God had done with them."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch each had their own administration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They had fellowship one with another, but there was no union.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reason men were sent to Jerusalem was that the circumcised ones were from Jerusalem vv.</S>
