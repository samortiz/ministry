   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX HOW THE OLD TESTAMENT SEEKERS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENJOYED HIS LAW 1 Scripture Reading: Psalm 119:1-2, 14-16, 20, 30, 35-36, 40, 42-43, 45, 47-48, 54, 55, 58, 66, 70, 74, 77, 80, 92, 94, 97, 103, 111-114, 117, 119, 127, 131-132, 135, 140, 147, 159, 162, 165, 167-170, 172-174; 19:10b</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 119 is a psalm which dwells specifically on the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The longest piece in the book of Psalms, this psalm was written according to the sequence of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, with each of its twenty-two sections using eight verses for each of the twenty-two Hebrew letters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, this psalm of one hundred seventy-six verses has more verses than the whole book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Due to its length, it is difficult to cover in a brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The foregoing messages on the law of God should be helpful to us in understanding Psalm 119.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The psalmist did not write this psalm according to theology.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, it was written according to his sentiment and experience, according to the deep aspiration of his heart, and according to his enjoyment of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The psalmists expressed their hunger, thirst, and desire for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Like all the psalms, Psalm 119 is filled with aspiration, not with doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 131 says, I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the psalmist uses the word panted, a word also used in Psalm 42:1: As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The note in one version says that in Hebrew the word pant refers to the longing for a cool spring after suffering burning heat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The use of this word in Psalm 119:131 and 42:1 shows the deep sentiment and aspiration of the psalmists.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The psalmists thirsted and panted after God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, although Psalm 119 has much to say about the law, it does not speak about the law from the perspective of doctrine, but from the viewpoint of spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This psalm was written by one who dealt with the law in the way of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this message and in the next, we shall look into Psalm 119 to consider how the Old Testament seekers of God enjoyed His law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I. SEEKING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Psalm 119:2 tells us that those who enjoyed God s law in the Old Testament were seekers of God: Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The writer of Psalm 119 was such a seeker.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christians are not familiar with the term seekers of God, even though this concept is biblical.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Psalm 119, seeking God is related to keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you try to keep the law without having a heart to seek God, your efforts will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the serious shortcoming of the Judaizers at the time of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Trying to keep the law without seeking God with their whole heart, they failed in their endeavor to fulfill the law s requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we want to walk according to God s law, we must seek Him with our whole heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>LOVING HIS NAME</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AND REMEMBERING IT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Psalm 119:132 says, Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse indicates that the psalmist loved the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 55 says, I have remembered thy name, O Jehovah, in the night, and have kept thy law Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the psalmist awoke during the night, he remembered the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we remember in the night reveals our true interest, even the thing that occupies us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What do you think of when you wake up at night?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are one who seeks God, you will remember His name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His name will be your special interest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Young people, I hope that when you awake during the night, you will not dwell on worldly things, but will remember the sweet, precious name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Like the Old Testament saints, may we all love the Lord s name and remember it, even in the middle of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ENTREATING HIS COUNTENANCE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Psalm 119:58 says, I entreated thy face with my whole heart Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The King James Version uses the word favor instead of face.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To seek a person s face is actually to seek his favor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we entreat the Lord s face, His countenance, we shall receive bounty.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Often little children will earnestly seek the face of their mother.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To them nothing is more dear than beholding their mother s face.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We also should seek the Lord in such an intimate way, entreating His countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord s countenance brings His favor to the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For whatever the psalmist needed, he would entreat God s countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Psalm 105:4 says, Seek the Lord, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to this verse, we need to seek God s face continually.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then in Psalm 42:5 the psalmist praises God for the help of his countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a deeply personal and intimate way, the psalmist sought the help of the Lord s countenance.</S>
