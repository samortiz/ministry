   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CALLING ON THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2 Timothy 2:22 Paul charged Timothy to flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the Lord's seekers must be His callers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Out of a Pure Heart</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We call on the name of the Lord by our spirit, yet it must be out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our heart must be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A pure heart is a heart with a pure motive, a pure intention, a pure purpose, a pure will, a pure decision, a pure sensation, a pure feeling, and a pure thought.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If these things are not pure, our heart is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, we cannot call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A pure heart is a heart seeking only God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The only goal of a pure heart is God Himself Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we seek after anything other than God, our motive is not pure, and thus our heart is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must call on the Lord with an exercised spirit out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our heart must be purified, and the heart includes all these things: motive, intention, purpose, will, decision, sensation, feeling, and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The heart must be pure in all of its constituents.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we can call on the Lord purely.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. With the Lord's Callers</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second Timothy 2:22 implies that we need to call on the Lord with the Lord's callers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes we call on the Lord just by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This exercises our spirit and we receive more of the Lord, but not as much as when we call with some others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To have a corporate calling on the Lord helps a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to exercise our spirit, we have to recover the practice of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to exercise our spirit so that we may receive the Lord more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we can live a godly life to manifest God.</S>
