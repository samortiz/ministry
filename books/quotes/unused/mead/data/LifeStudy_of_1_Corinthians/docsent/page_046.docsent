   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN GOD S WISDOM IN A MYSTERY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AS THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:6-10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The title of this message is God s Wisdom in a Mystery, Christ as the Deep Things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The comma in the title indicates that Christ as the deep things of God stands in apposition to God s wisdom in a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s wisdom in a mystery is actually the all-inclusive Christ as the deep things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapters one and two of 1 Corinthians are a very deep portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not many readers of the Bible understand these chapters properly and adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul s word in 2:6-10 is especially deep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not take these verses or these chapters for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, knowing these chapters is necessary for understanding the remainder of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The gateway to understanding 1 Corinthians is found in chapters one and two.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A MYSTERIOUS WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 2:6 Paul says, But we speak wisdom among those who are full-grown, yet a wisdom not of this age, neither of the rulers of this age, who are being brought to nought.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the foregoing verses Paul says that he did not come with excellence of wisdom and that his speech was not in persuasive words of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in verse 6 he says that he speaks wisdom among those who are full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Paul wrote this Epistle, he certainly realized that the believers at Corinth were far from full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why, then, does he say that he speaks wisdom among those who are full-grown?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His purpose in doing this was to belittle the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here Paul seems to be saying, You Corinthians think you have attained something great, but actually you are still babes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do speak wisdom, but we speak wisdom among those who are full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, the wisdom we speak is not a wisdom of this age, neither of the rulers of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The common people do not have this wisdom, and those in the ruling class do not have it either.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In fact, the rulers of this age are being brought to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 7 Paul continues, But we speak God s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s wisdom is Christ 1:24 , who is the hidden mystery Col 1:26-27 , predestined, predesignated, and foreordained before the ages, in eternity, for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Glory in this verse refers to Christ, who is the Lord of glory v. 8 . Christ is our life today Col 3:4 and He will be our glory in the future Col 1:27 . To this glory God has called us 1 Pet 5:10 , and into it He will bring us Heb 2:10 . This is the goal of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to verse 7, God s wisdom is in a mystery; it is a mysterious wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, God s wisdom is not like Greek wisdom, which is open and very shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, God s wisdom is the wisdom which has been hidden and which God predestined before the ages for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s wisdom is our destiny, and this destiny was determined by God, decided by Him, beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In eternity God determined our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He predestined His wisdom to be for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that in eternity He decided that His wisdom would be our destiny and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our destiny is not merely the enjoyment of eternal blessings in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, our destiny is God s mysterious wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has predestined His mysterious wisdom to be our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 8 Paul continues his thought from verse 7: Which not one of the rulers of this age has known; for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this verse the relative pronoun which refers to wisdom in verse 7; it does not refer to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say, But even as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The sphere of what the eye can see is narrow; the sphere of what the ear can hear is broader; and the sphere of what the heart can realize is without limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God in His wisdom that is, in Christ has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these the human eye has never seen, the human ear has never heard, and the human heart has never realized.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 10 says, For God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we shall see, the depths of God here refer to Christ as the deep things of God.</S>
