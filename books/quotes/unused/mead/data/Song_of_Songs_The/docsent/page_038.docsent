   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Silent Answer 4:9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 9 says, "Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the first time the King calls her his spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this time, her mind is completely one with the King.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why the King considers her to be a person to whom he can commit himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At this point she is able to participate in everything that the King does.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At this point her love reaches a degree that is above the ordinary and becomes pure to the point that a marriage relationship is sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most important thing to remember is that she has passed through countless dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this time everything that is manifested in her is of the new creation, and she can satisfy the King's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The main reason that she can be the King's spouse is that the King loves her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The King can love her unreservedly because the Holy Spirit has worked on her to the extent that she has become altogether lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the first time the King calls her "my sister."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is because she now possesses the same nature as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One Heb 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Abraham's wife was his sister, and Isaac married a sister of his own household.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The difference between Jacob and Esau is that one married a Gentile, while the other married a sister of his mother's household.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, Christ's love is lavished on those who have the same life as He, and who come from the same Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Thou hast ravished my heart."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This can be translated as "Thou hast given me courage" see ASV, margin .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The King is saying, "You have encouraged me to love you; you have encouraged me to draw near to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have encouraged me to be satisfied with you and to lead you on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have encouraged me because you have answered my demands and because you have said what your eyes have said.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When your eyes look at me, they say that you are willing to come with me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In an atmosphere of love, the eyes say much more than the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Did not the Lord speak to Peter with His eyes Luke 22:61 ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outsiders cannot understand the language of the eyes, but love can comprehend the intentions of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only have the maiden's eyes revealed her desire for Him, but the chain on her neck has shown Him her answer as well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The chain on the neck is a symbol of submission to God's instruction Prov 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She has encouraged Him by her submission to the teaching of the Holy Spirit and by the moral edification which the Holy Spirit has wrought in her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She has caused Him to love her and to know that He can lead her on.</S>
