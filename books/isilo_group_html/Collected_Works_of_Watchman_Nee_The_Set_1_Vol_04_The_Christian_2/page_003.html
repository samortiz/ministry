This book is a book for slaves. He did not show Himself as the Head of the Body to His disciples or as their friend to disclose to them what was in His heart. Rather, as their Master He shows His slaves the things which "must quickly take place." How different this is from John 15:15: "No longer do I call you slaves." In the Gospel of John, the sole purpose of the Holy Spirit is to point out that those who believe in the Lord Jesus are children of God. John 1:12 says: "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name." After the Lord resurrected from the dead, He said, "Go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" (20:17). Here, however, we stand on a different ground. What is said here is not in the relationship of an individual with the family of God, but the responsibility of an individual in the administration of God. Although this book mentions God's wonderful redemption, the Holy Spirit does not refer to God as the Father, except in five places where it refers to Him as the Father of the Lamb.</P><P>There is a big difference between a son and a slave. The saints are not slaves first, then sons. We do not become His sons by serving Him but by believing in His only begotten Son. This does not, however, annul our responsibility of serving God. After we become His sons, we should consider Him as our Master and should obey Him in everything. This is God's arrangement. The meaning of slave here is the acknowledgment of the legal right of the Lord. In the original text this word should be translated "slave." Paul (Rom. 1:1), Peter (2 Pet. 1:1), James (James 1:1), and Jude (Jude 1) all called themselves slaves. If we are not slaves of the Lord, we are not free men! We were sold to the Lord because He purchased us with His precious blood. Therefore, according to legal right, we belong to Him forever and are His slaves. We should pay attention to one thing: our salvation is accomplished completely by the Lord Jesus. As soon as we believe in Him, we are forever saved. However, this is not the end. It does not mean that once we are saved and become the children of God, that is the end. On the contrary, it is the beginning of our life. From the day we were saved, we have been the children of God positionally, and this position will never change. At the same time, we are His slaves to serve Him in works. The children of God who sincerely obey Him are His slaves. Much serving in works without obedience will not touch God's heart. Obedience will be a test before the judgment seat.</P><P>Let me say a further word here. To serve God and to work for Him is indeed the responsibility of every child of God. However, is there not much self-righteousness and disobedience in man's works? Perhaps many works will completely disappear before God's light! Many people may be able to say, "Behold, so many years I have been slaving for you and have never neglected a command of yours" (Luke 15:29), but they are outsiders to the sound of joy in their Father's house! Many people can pray, "I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get" (Luke 18:12). Our loving Lord, however, said that the sinner who smote upon his breasts saying, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner" (Luke 18:13) is more justified by God than they are. Let us serve the Lord, not because of duty, nor because of the praise of men, but because of our love to Him. The service of a slave should be based on one's position as a son. "He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised" (2 Cor. 5:15). How different are those who serve due to fear of future chastisement, from those who labor due to love of the present Lord! Though labors of love require in many instances the denial and humbling of ourselves, we do not murmur or complain. There is only rejoicing; there is nothing else. The book of Revelation is for such persons. "Show to His slaves." Only when we stand in the position of slaves is there a possibility for us to understand this book. Therefore, if we are not worthy of such a title, we cannot expect God to show it unto us.</P><P>The word slaves means all the slaves. Some are very lowly; others are very noble. Some are very manifest; others are very hidden. Apart from the eyes of the Lord, no one can see them. Thank the Lord, if we are faithful to serve Him, He is pleased to accept us no matter where we are. He does not care for our position. He only cares how we are in our position. Lowliness and seclusion cannot prevent us from having fellowship with God and His Son. Exaltation and manifestation, on the other hand, without real experience to match them before the Lord, is very dangerous. Mere outward glory without inward dying with the Lord will cause spiritual bankruptcy. No matter where we are or what we do, we should all receive encouragement and reminding from Revelation. Since the Lord is so loving as to show this book to His slaves, may the Lord cause us not to neglect His gift.</P><P>After reading the phrase, the things which "must quickly take place," we must not think that since the word spoken then was to "quickly take place," it should have been fulfilled by now. God's wisdom is clearly seen here, because if God told His slaves that there would be twenty more centuries before Christ would come back, it would cause people to slumber. It was possible that Christ could have come back then. According to the God of patience, one thousand years are just as one day. The prophecy here has just such a spirit. The word "shortly" in Romans 16:20 is the same as the words "must quickly take place" here. The promise in Romans 16, like that in Revelation, is also yet to be fulfilled. When we read on, we will see that there are indeed many things which have already been fulfilled (cf. chapters two and three). At that time the church age was still unsettled. That is why the Lord Jesus Himself said, "Behold, I come quickly." Accordingly, His saints should have their loins girded, their lamps burning, and they themselves like men waiting for their own master (Luke 12:35-36). May we be prepared for the Lord's coming today!</P><P>According to the spirit and nature of this book, we can see that this book is not the Lord's direct instruction to His slaves. Neither is it the Lord's direct instruction to John. Rather, "He made it known by signs, sending it by His angel to His slave John." Here, John was not the disciple who was "reclining on Jesus' bosom" "whom Jesus loved" (John 13:23). Rather, he was His "slave." What a responsibility this is! Stephen said that the law Israel received was by the ordinances of angels (Acts 7:53). The book of Hebrews makes a contrast between "the word spoken through angels" and that which was "spoken to us in the Son" (the Lord Jesus) (2:2; 1:2). Here, the Lord Jesus also spoke to John by His angel. By this we know that this book goes back to the realm of the children of Israel in the Old Testament. This book shows how the Lord deals with the worldly people and how He takes care of Israel, His people. This book does not speak of the particular rights of the church. It only speaks of her responsibility to Christ. She is a branch grafted onto the true olive tree; if no fruit is borne, she will be hewn down. If one does not understand this characteristic, it will be difficult to understand Revelation.</P><P>The angel who spoke to John was clearly mentioned again in chapter twenty-two: "And I John am he who hears and sees these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. And he said to me, Do not do that! I am your fellow slave and a fellow slave of your brothers the prophets and of those who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God" (vv. 8-9). He was not jealous of the worship of men! He was a "fellow slave." A true slave of God must be like this slave. To be jealous for men's praise is to rob God of His glory. How good it would be to cause someone to worship God while keeping oneself hidden.</P><P>We should pay attention to one more point: What the angel signified to John was the things which "must quickly take place." The words "quickly take place" mean "to be accomplished in a short time." Hence, in this book whatever was signified by the angel was to be fulfilled in a short time. Anything else was not to be fulfilled shortly. Chapters one through three cover what the Lord Himself said. Therefore, they were not fulfilled in a short time. What the angel signified are the words after chapter four. To make "known by signs" means to point out clearly. Compare John 21:18-19 and Acts 11:28 and 25:27. To "signify" also carries the sense of "to perform." God "performed" the coming acts to John through the many visions.</P><P>Since this book is given by God, sent out by Christ, signified by the angel, and written by John, we should receive it. How wise the Lord is! He solemnly proclaimed to us the importance of this book beforehand in order that we would receive it attentively. What a pity that though it is so solemn, there are still many who despise this book! How different are their thoughts from God's!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 04: The Christian (2) &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
