   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INNER SENSE BEING THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to know this inner sense in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This inner sense comes out of five main items within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since we have the life from the Lord, we have the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 1:4 speaks of the light, but it does not mention "the light of life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This phrase is in 8:12, which says, "Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Strictly speaking and according to our experience, the light of life is the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we received the Lord Jesus, He came into our spirit as life to dwell and work there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By His dwelling, working, and living there is this sense, and this sense is the enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we have the life of the Lord Jesus within us, this life enlightens us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know this because we sense it; we have the feeling and consciousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a believer, a reborn young man, goes dancing, as he is going, there is the inner sense within him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To have this sense means that we are not in darkness but in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The faster the unbelievers go to dance, the happier they are, because they are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They do not have this inner sense to tell them that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is needless to speak of going dancing; sometimes when we have only a wrong or impure motive, right away there is the sense of condemnation in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This sense of condemnation is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now you can understand that the light of life is simply the inner sense in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we have the inner sense in the spirit, we have the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How do we know we are wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may say we feel or we sense we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This sense within us is the enlightening; at least it comes out of the enlightening of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The inner life, which is the Lord Jesus Himself, enlightens us within, and by this enlightening we have the inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need for anyone to tell us that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times we argue that we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some things seem right as long as we argue for them, but when we stop arguing, we see that we are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to our argument we are right, but in fact we know that we are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we were truly right, there would be no need for argument.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times a wife may argue with her husband, insisting that she is right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She may be right in word, but she is not right in her spirit and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When her words stop, she realizes she is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know this because we sense it, and we sense it because we have the life of the Lord Jesus shining within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we are in the light and not in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times when a brother argues with me, I am happy, because I know that behind his speaking is a sense of condemnation as the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more he argues, the more I am clear that he is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When such a person argues, I often do not say much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I may say, "Perhaps you are right," although he is right only in argument.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In actuality, he is in the light; he has light within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This light is not from knowledge or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"In Him was life, and the life was the light of men" John 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we have Christ within us as our life, this very life is the shining light within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We simply have a sense within us which we cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot escape from this shining.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Young men especially always like to be right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I was young, however, I went to people perhaps ten times a day to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I might say, "Brother, excuse me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This morning I argued with you, but now I am clear.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To tell the truth, I am clear not only now, but even this morning I was already clear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While I was arguing with you, I was clear that I was wrong, but I would not lose my face.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now by the Lord's mercy I know that I have to confess to you."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that I was in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These experiences prove that we have something living within us, because we have the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This life within us is the light of men and the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please keep this in mind: The light of life gives us the inner sense while it enlightens.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can never separate the sense of life from the enlightening of the light of life.</S>
