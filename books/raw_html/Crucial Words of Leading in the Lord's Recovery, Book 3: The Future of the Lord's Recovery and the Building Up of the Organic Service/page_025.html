	 <h2 class="head2">In Africa</h2>
<p>In Africa the Lord&rsquo;s testimony began in Ghana. Ghana is on the west coast of Africa. It was called Gold Coast when it was a British colony, and it became the Republic of Ghana when it gained its independence. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony in Africa also began through our publications in English. From Ghana the Lord&rsquo;s recovery went to Nigeria. Nigeria is the largest country in West Africa. Its capital, Lagos, has nine million people. There is a church there. There is also a church in North Africa, in Libya.</p>
<p>In recent years the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has also gone to the Republic of South Africa, which is on the southernmost tip of Africa. Due to amendments in their constitution, Chinese people there enjoy the same rights and privileges as the Caucasians. There are three churches in South Africa, two of which are in the capital Pretoria and in Cape Town. There is also a church in Zimbabwe, which is a country to the northeast of South Africa. Not long ago they sent me a letter asking for permission to translate the Life-study messages. They also want us to supply them with our publications.</p>
<p>These African countries are economically weak, so we have been supplying them with free publications for the past few years. To date we have supplied books and tapes worth over fifty thousand U.S. dollars to Ghana alone. The situation in these countries is encouraging. The testimonies in these countries were not raised up by our going there; they were raised up by the publications. After being helped by the publications, some of the believers attended the trainings in America. Afterward, they returned to their country to raise up the testimony of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Australia</h2>
<p>When we speak of Australia, we are including New Zealand. The situation in these countries is very encouraging. There are three or four churches in Australia, including churches in Sydney and Melbourne. There are approximately ten churches in New Zealand. We thank the Lord that the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are now in all five continents in the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In Asia</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in China for more than sixty years, but there was nothing happening in India or Burma (Myanmar). Many years ago some saints moved to the island of Ceylon, but the situation was not clear. However, over the past year or two the Lord has been working in India and Burma. The first church has been established in Burma, and the church in Bangkok, Thailand has been in contact with them. There is also a local Burmese young man who has been in contact with us by letter. His written English is very good. In his letters he told us that there are approximately nineteen groups meeting in Burma. They are not very clear concerning the way of the church, but he said that they receive much help when they read the Life-study messages. They have requested permission to translate all the Life-study messages into Burmese. He said that he is a young person who loves the Lord and is pursuing theology. We believe that in the future he will be brought into this way. We have also received a letter from another believer; based on his writing, use of words, and his name, he is probably a missionary from England. He said that they have several meeting places and several Bible-study groups. Since he has received much help from reading the Life-study messages, he wants to use the Life-study messages to supply the needs of their Bible studies. He asked for permission to use and translate these messages. These are two good situations.</p>
<p>In the southern part of India there is a brother who is a high school teacher, and he is about forty years of age. He began to fellowship with us because of our publications. He has lived in America for approximately one year. After this year&rsquo;s winter training, he will return to southern India and begin the church life there. I hope that we will all pray for this matter.</p>
<p>In recent years I have been receiving letters from believers in many countries telling me how much help they have received from the Life-study messages. I have saved all these letters, and I hope that one day the letters will be printed in a book entitled <em>Letters of Appreciation.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK IN TAIWAN</h2>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are ready to go to Italy and India, and there are other brothers and sisters who want to go to Africa, Australia, and northern Europe. Every move involves specific steps, just as every military attack must have a strategy. Fighting a war requires not only skills but also strategies. One must not move too quickly; a desire to do something quickly prevents a person from being thorough. I look to the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit to work in you.</p>
<p>I have been living in the English-speaking world for more than twenty years. During this time I have visited Sydney and Melbourne in Australia as well as several cities in New Zealand; I have also traveled to Europe and to South America. I have a clear understanding of the situation in these places. From my observation of their situation, I feel that the churches in Taiwan have the most potential, because they have a history of more than thirty years. During these more than thirty years, the Lord has truly blessed Taiwan and made it peaceful and secure. The most necessary thing for the gospel work is a secure environment as well as a well-educated population. Then when the Lord&rsquo;s recovery comes with the gospel and the truth, it will be easy to &ldquo;catch fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the first six or seven years, our numbers increased one hundredfold, from five hundred to fifty thousand. Later our increase was interrupted because too much emphasis was placed on &ldquo;spiritual pursuit.&rdquo; The thirty-five years of our history in Taiwan can be divided into five seven-year periods. During the first seven years, the number of saints increased from five hundred to fifty thousand. Due to the interruption, we no longer had a definite direction. Hence, we have not increased in numbers for the past twenty-eight years, or the past four seven-year periods. At present, there are only forty-five to fifty thousand brothers and sisters in all of Taiwan.</p>
<p>A certain group in Hong Kong put out a book with statistics. This book said that in Taiwan the Presbyterian denomination has the largest number of Christians; it has more than eighty thousand people. The second largest group is the &ldquo;Local Church,&rdquo; with forty-five thousand people. The third largest group is the True Jesus Church. This group is mainly in the mountainous areas and has more than twenty thousand people. Our numbers are low because for the last twenty-eight years our work has mainly been to stabilize and maintain; we did not do a work of spreading as we did in the first seven years. Of course, we must thank the Lord for the stability of our present situation.</p>
<p>We confess that we have many weaknesses and shortcomings, but our situation is better than the situation of other Christians groups. We have been equipping many saints for more than ten years. When I returned to Taiwan in 1966, many of the young people wanted to serve the Lord full time, and they wrote down their consecration. That was eighteen years ago. We still have their consecrations. I believe that more than one thousand saints consecrated themselves. What they wrote was a contract with the Lord. Therefore, as one who represents the Lord, I have come to tell you that it is time for you to fulfill your contract.</p>
