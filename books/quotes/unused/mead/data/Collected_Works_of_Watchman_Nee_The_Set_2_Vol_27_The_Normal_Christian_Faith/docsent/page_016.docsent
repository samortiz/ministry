   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR GOD BECOMING MAN 2 THE BIRTH OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If God is to be a man, He must come into the world in a way that is very different from all other mortals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We come into the world through our parents and are conceived by our mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To ascertain whether Jesus of Nazareth is an ordinary person or the incarnated God, we need to examine His birth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If His birth was no different from ours, we have to conclude that He is nothing but a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only does He have to pass the first qualification, but He needs to pass the second one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not hastily believe in a person simply because he claims to be God; we have to test him by our second criterion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he is indeed God, he must be born in an extraordinary manner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we study the birth of Jesus, we will find that it was very different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament tell us this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jesus was born of a virgin, Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>BORN OF A VIRGIN</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before we go on, we have to realize that there are two ways to know God: by natural speculation or by revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to natural speculation, one meditates and conjectures about God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In revelation, God speaks to man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We want to look at the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We want to know what God says.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospels of Matthew and Luke show us that Jesus was born of a virgin, Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This important fact enables us to conclude that He is no ordinary person, and it justifies our being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The natural mentality cannot readily accept this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some years ago, a big debate was conducted in England.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On one side were prominent leaders of modernistic schools of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other side was a famous Presbyterian pastor-theologian.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Four major topics were raised.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Twice a day, for four consecutive days, each side took turns delivering a long speech for a total of eight messages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One of the topics was related to our subject the virgin birth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The modernistic theologians asserted that one reason alone was enough to disprove the virgin birth the event was biologically impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the law of biology, it is impossible to have the virgin birth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>DID IT HAPPEN OR NOT?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the same day, their opponent gave the rebuttal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me briefly mention a few of his arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said, "Our friends have denied the possibility of such an event on the ground of biological law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am here to ask whether such an event happened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They asked, Can this happen?'</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They referred you to academic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am asking, Has this happened?'</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I point to a historical occurrence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is one thing to be academically justified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is another thing to be historically recorded."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As he was speaking, he drew out a newspaper from his pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the paper was an article about an accident that had happened a few days earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A man was driving on a winding mountain road.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Due to carelessness, the car slid and tumbled down a deep gorge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The car was totally wrecked.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not even a square foot of the vehicle was left untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was thoroughly damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the man on the ground was absolutely unhurt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later, he rose up and walked away.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The theologian read the passage aloud and said, "This car tumbled down a thousand feet into ruin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You cannot even find a square foot of whole metal, and yet the man was unharmed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My friends would ask, Could this man live?'</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But my question is, Is this man alive?'</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is alive!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you consider the possibility, there is none.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if you consider the fact, there it is!"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What we have is a historical fact.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we try to study the virgin birth from a scientific point of view, we may conclude that this is an impossible event.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But my question is whether or not such an event occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Gospel of Matthew says that Jesus was born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>So does the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At least you have to say that these records have said such a thing and that such an event was recorded in history.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At least you have to believe that there is a historical event.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>WRITTEN AFTER CAREFULLY INVESTIGATING</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am not asserting that Matthew and Luke were inspired by the Holy Spirit when they wrote their books.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether these books were divinely inspired or not, we will set aside for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are saying that there were a few people who followed Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They wrote His biography.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Both Matthew and Luke were contemporaries of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Matthew followed Him for more than three years.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Luke was not as close, but he "carefully investigated all things" Luke 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I believe that when he wrote his gospel, the mother of Jesus was still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What did they say about the birth of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They all testified that Jesus was born of the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His birth was absolutely different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today, after almost two thousand years, some who never saw Jesus, never talked to Mary His mother, and never met Joseph His father, conclude that He was not born of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How can you say that He was not born in this manner?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Are you ruling out the possibility of such an event and concluding that it did not happen because of some arguments you proposed in your study room or some theories you fashioned in the laboratory?</S>
