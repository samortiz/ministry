   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIFE-STUDIES BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A HELP FOR STUDYING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not merely get excited concerning this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We also need to work hard to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Learning the truth is a must, and the only way to learn the truth is to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some believers read only spiritual publications.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is to receive inspiration and can be compared to eating a snack or drinking coffee.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will not be healthy if we eat only snacks and drink coffee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to eat proper food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am healthy because I eat three proper meals every day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not rely on snacks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same way, our proper, spiritual food is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am thankful to the Lord that I learned from several good teachers in the Brethren Assembly during the first seven years of my Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I also heard much Bible exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The impression that the truths of the Bible formed within me is still very powerful and cannot be nullified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be touched when we read a spiritual publication, but that feeling will last for only a few days, and then it will vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the truths of the Bible that enter into us are permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we should be encouraged to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone needs to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I know that it is not easy to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am burdened to help the saints to enter into the truths of the Bible, because I also experienced difficulties in learning the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This burden to help the saints was the source of my writing the Life-studies, which are included in the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s recovery has a secure standing in the Far East, and it has spread to every continent in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Beginning in 1974 I began to use every opportunity to put my knowledge of the Bible into writing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was already seventy years old by that time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I labored diligently for eleven years to complete the Life-study of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a great asset that will render the brothers and sisters much help.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During those eleven years, I worked with two helpers for about five hours a day and four to five months every year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I wrote notes for every chapter from Matthew to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are several principles in my writing of the Life-study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, the Life-studies are not focused on knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are a life-study; they do not expound the Bible according to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, the function of the Life-studies is to open our mind so that we can understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, as long as we read the Life-studies and the footnotes of the Recovery Version, our mind will be opened to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Life-studies also resolve difficult portions in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There are a number of portions in the Bible that have puzzled readers for the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some of these portions were resolved correctly, others incorrectly, and still others were not resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I went through these portions and consulted reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I then tried my best to write the answers in a proper and unbiased way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, almost all the difficult portions in the Bible are resolved in the footnotes of the Recovery Version, and the answers are definite.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I began to study the Bible in my youth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For seven and a half years after I was saved, I met with one of the strictest groups of the Brethren, who are known for their exposition of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In our meetings we were taught by an elderly British brother who had profound biblical knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He once spent at least six months to expound Romans 1:1-2, which says, The gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every Lord s Day he expounded clearly and logically the promises in the Old Testament related to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In those seven and a half years I attended five meetings every week no matter how heavy it rained or how much it snowed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I received a good foundation there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later I contacted Brother Nee and became his co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I received much help from him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, I also studied the teachings of the church fathers throughout the centuries and the writings of Martin Luther and the Reformers after him, of the mystics, of the inner-life, and even of Pentecostalism.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I collected and assimilated the best Bible expositions in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These are incorporated in the footnotes of the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the footnotes contain the very best of Christian knowledge and Bible exposition throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I used simple English when I wrote the footnotes of the Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes my polishers revised the phrases and words, but I made it clear to them that I do not want to show off my learning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I wanted to reduce the scholarly flavor and present the genuine truths to people in simple words.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, the footnotes are easy to read.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I spent much time and effort to write the footnotes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I had two helpers who consulted at least twenty different reference books of two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first category of reference books were related to the original text, and the second category were Bible expositions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, I spent one week to write footnote 6 for 1 John 1:6 concerning the eight points on truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that this footnote is a great help to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Before I wrote that footnote, whenever I spoke on the word truth, I had to study in order to determine the proper definition and find the supporting verses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not need to do that anymore, because all the definitions and supporting verses are in the footnote.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are quite a number of footnotes like this.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, all the saints, and especially the young people, should be encouraged to read the Recovery Version and the Life-studies of the New Testament.</S>
