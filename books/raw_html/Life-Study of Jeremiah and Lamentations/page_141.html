Not only before the fall of Jerusalem, but even in the fall and after the fall of Jerusalem, Israel remained stubborn in their sinning against Jehovah. Yet Jeremiah remained firm in his speaking for Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN THE FALL OF JERUSALEM</H2><P>Jeremiah 39:1-10 is a record concerning the fall of Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Capture of Jerusalem</H2><P>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and besieged it (39:1). In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city and Jerusalem was captured (vv. 2-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Punishment upon Zedekiah</H2><P>In verses 4 through 10 we see the punishment upon Zedekiah. When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw the Chaldeans, they fled from the city by night by way of the king's garden. However, the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he judged him. The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also slew all the nobles of Judah. Then he blinded (put out) Zedekiah's eyes and bound him in bronze fetters to bring him to Babylon.</P><P>Following this, the Chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. The rest of the people, both those who deserted to Nebuchadnezzar and those who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried into exile to Babylon. But some of the poorest people the captain of the bodyguard left in the land of Judah and gave them vineyards and fields at that time.</P>
