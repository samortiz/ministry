We all know that there is a limit to man's physical strength. For example, a man may be able only to lift thirty pounds. Suppose he is walking down a road with thirty pounds of goods on his shoulder, and he sees a little beautiful table that weighs ten pounds. Do you think he can pick up the table and carry it home? Of course not, he is limited to thirty pounds. He cannot add another ten pounds. The only thing he can do is stare at the table and leave it where it is. The thirty pounds define his responsibility and measure; they are his necessary restraint. There is a limitation to his physical strength; he cannot add another ten pounds. In the same way, there is a limit to the capacity of our outer man, our thoughts, our intelligence, our opinion, and our sentiments. There is a limit to the capacity of our soul.</p><p>Many people realize that there is a limit to their physical strength, but they do not realize that there is a limit to the power of their outer man as well. For example, there is a limit to human affection. Even a man who is rich in emotion cannot exercise an unlimited amount of love. If he devotes all of his love to his family, he does not have much strength to love others. Even a heavyweight champion cannot do everything. A girl can love her friends at school, but the presence of this love may mean that she cannot spare any more of her love to her mother at home. There is a limit to love. A man cannot love everyone. In the same principle, there is a limit to our thoughts. Those who are too busy with their own thoughts do not have any available strength to give thought to their inner man when the spirit needs release. At such times, the thoughts actually become a hindrance to the release of the spirit. Some people are strong in their will. They are never short of suggestions, and they are more than willing to be a counselor to others. We may think that these ones are unlimited in their energy. However, many so-called strong ones find their will wavering when they are confronted by God to make a decision. They do not know how to make decisions with regard to things related to God. Their will power has been exhausted on other things, and their will wavers like a flag fluttering in the wind. Man's will is limited in its capacity.</p><p>We must see that the power of the outer man, that is, the power of the soul, like the power of the physical body, is limited in its capacity. This is the reason the outer man has to be broken. The soul has to be dealt with so that it does not act independently from the spirit. We must not allow the outer man to exhaust its energy, or the spirit cannot use it. Our mind, emotion, and will should be tempered so that they may be under the direction of our spirit.</p><h2 class="head4">The Emotion Being Limited</h2><p>The breaking of the outer man involves the dealing with the mind, emotion, and will of the outer man. Those who are influenced by their emotion and who are very emotional are limited in the amount of love they can give. When they love a person, they are attached to him like a bee to honey. When they hate a person, they treat him like an enemy. This emotional proclivity must be seriously dealt with and broken before God can use their outer man. If a man's emotion is dealt with and his love is "broken," God will use him to love all kinds of people. Being broken in one's emotion does not mean that a person has lost his ability to love. It means that he has lost his inclination and choice in the way he exercises his love. Now a person can love all men and all saints. The Lord has to remove our emotional proclivities from their very roots so that our emotion can become useful to God and no longer be focused on the self. If a man loves his wife and children with all his heart and mind, he is so busy with this love that he has no more strength to love others. He is not able to love the church or the brothers and sisters. The Lord must deal with his emotion by applying the Spirit's discipline through the environment or by rebuking him through the ministry of the word. In this way his outer man is broken and his inner man is free to love all men. Our inner man is not free because our outer man is too strong and busy. When the outer man is busy with its own affairs, the spirit cannot be released. The inner man wants to love, but the outer man may have used up all of its love.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
