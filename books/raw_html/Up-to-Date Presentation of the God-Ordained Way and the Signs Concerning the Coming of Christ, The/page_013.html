<P>In this message we will see the New Testament priestly service ordained by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALL THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS<br>BEING PRIESTS TO SERVE GOD</H2><P>The New Testament service ordained by God in the Scriptures indicates that all New Testament believers are priests to serve God (Rev. 1:5-6). The priests are those who serve God. Everyone who serves God, anywhere and at any time, must be a priest whose special profession is to serve full time before God. Although he serves full time, he still labors for his livelihood, working with his own hands to minister to his own needs. Paul was the top and best serving one of God in the New Testament. He also held the job of tent-making, laboring and working with his own hands. He not only ministered to his own needs but also took care of the needs of his co-workers. Therefore, on the one hand, we serve God exclusively, and on the other hand, we also have a way to make a living. We should not allow others to worry about us because of our serving the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL OF GOD</H2><P>Almost everywhere in the entire New Testament, God speaks concerning how to be priests of the gospel of God, how to serve God. Paul called the New Testament priests the priests of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). They are priests, yet they are gospel preachers, priests who specialize in the gospel. In the Old Testament the priests specialized in taking care of the sacrifices. By this we can see that the priests of the gospel, mentioned in Romans 15:16, are those who specialize in taking care of the gospel. In Greek, the phrase a priest of the gospel has a further meaning; it denotes not only a priest of the gospel, but a laboring priest of the gospel. In other words, the New Testament priests of the gospel should be laboring priests of the gospel&#151;not priests who are content or at leisure, but priests diligently striving and laboring. They are priests who diligently labor in the gospel of God. Paul was such a priest of the gospel of God, and we too should be such.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being Built Up into God's Holy Priesthood</H2><P>According to the New Testament, there are at least seven aspects related to being priests of the gospel of God. First, these priests are built up into God's holy priesthood. The priests of the gospel of God do not serve alone or individually; they are built up into a priesthood. We know that today any kind of successful work in human society must be a work that is carried out by an organized group. It is difficult for individuals to have a great success; the achieving of a great success depends on the effort of an organized group. The priests in the Old Testament did not serve individually; they carried out their duty group by group. They all belonged to the house of Aaron; they were sons of Aaron formed into a body of priests. Luke chapter one tells us that when Zachariah the priest went to serve God, he served in the priestly body according to the order of his course. When we preach the gospel in the church today, we also should realize that the whole church constitutes a priesthood of the gospel.</P><P>In Greek, one word is used for priestly duties or priestly work and another for priestly body or priesthood, but in English the two words are treated as one. Therefore, in reading the English Bible, it is often difficult to tell what the particular word denotes. What is referred to both in 1 Peter 2:5 and 9 is the priesthood, not the priestly duties. Today in the church, we, the priests of the gospel, should be built up together to serve in coordination as a body of priests. Do not consider this a small thing. If we preach the gospel without any building up, but in a very individualistic way, our gospel will never be powerful or effective. For the preaching of the gospel to be both powerful and effective, we must be built up together and coordinated together.</P><P>In church history it is difficult to find one Christian body that has not been divided. It is not easy for us to be coordinated and built up in the church, for although we have been regenerated in our spirit, we often do not speak or walk in our spirit. If we want the church of the Lord to be blessed, first we must learn the lesson of coordination. We should learn to be upright and not crooked, to obey the Lord, and to be built up with others into a holy priesthood.</P>
