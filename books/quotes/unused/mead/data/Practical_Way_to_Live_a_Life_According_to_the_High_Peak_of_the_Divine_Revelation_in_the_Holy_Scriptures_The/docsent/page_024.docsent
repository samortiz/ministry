   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we praise You that You are the beginning and the ending.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, remember how You have commenced.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You should do something to give us a glorious consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not forget, Lord, that we are so weak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not have anything in which You can trust.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we put our trust in You in every way and in everything, not just for this meeting but for the future of Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We trust in You, but not in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can do nothing to improve Your recovery or to move Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our trust is in You.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do remember that this is Your recovery and impress us that we are not here for anything but Your recovery, Your move, Your testimony, and Your interest on this earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We believe that what You are doing here will close this age and will bring You in to have a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, remember this prayer that on this earth there is a little group of Your seekers wanting You to be their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, day by day, make them God-men, overcomers, for Your interest so that You can have a way to accomplish what You have been unable to do in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, remember that You are here and we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We tell You from our heart that we love You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We really love You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You must do what You want.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are so open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are subdued, even conquered by You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, do not forget that You do have such a people on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I. THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this chapter we want to see that we need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To build up the Body of Christ, we first have to know what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today it is difficult to see the reality of the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today even the term the Body of Christ is very rarely used, and when it is used, it is not used properly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would like to say an intimate word in fellowship, especially to the co-workers and elders among us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not forget that whatever you do in your locality or universally for other countries should be done in a full realization that you are building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may have a real burden to take care of the church in your locality, yet you should always realize that you are not doing a work just for the building up of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you are working to take care of the church, always keep a view of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should say, "Lord, what I am doing here is not for this, but for Your Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am under Your sovereign assignment, or arrangement, to work in this locality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It seems that I am doing a work to build up the local church here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But, Lord, actually I am not doing things to just build up the local church here in my locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What I am doing, Lord, is altogether for the building up of Your Body."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now I would like to present to you nine points of what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A. The Center, Reality, and Goal</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>of the Eternal Economy of God,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Consummating in the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Body of Christ is the center, the reality, and the ultimate goal of God's eternal economy, consummating in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:1 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Dear co-workers and dear elders, do you have the assurance that what you are doing in your locality is building up the center and reality of the economy of God and is building up something that can attain to the final goal of God's eternal economy?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For years I have realized that even among us, some have considered that the place where they work is a district of their work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was such a fact among us about ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A co-worker checked with some brothers, saying that when they came to his district to work, they should have notified him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This illustration is a real fact.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have such a feeling, you are off.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You are not building up the center, the reality, and the goal of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are building up your little empire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 1948, after Brother Nee had been working among us for twenty-six years, he was forced to give a message in Shanghai, in which he told a number of the workers that they were building up their little monarchy, or empire.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then he said that the churches which they built up were their own "native monarchies."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You must have the assurance that, wherever you are and whatever you do, you are building up the center, the reality, and the goal of the eternal economy of God, which will attain the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do not have such assurance, it is better to stop; it is better not to do anything.</S>
