   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANING OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we may come to the first lesson of prayer the meaning of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>May I ask you, brothers and sisters, what is prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is prayer all about?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the meaning of prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people, upon hearing the term prayer, immediately think that it means man coming before God to make supplication.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because man is in want and needs material supply, or is sick and needs healing, or has other problems and needs some solution, he goes before God asking Him to supply his needs, heal his sickness, and solve his problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Men consider these as prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apparently, there are examples of such prayers in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, the widow in Luke 18 continually went to the judge asking him to avenge her of her grievance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, brothers and sisters, please remember that this is not the proper meaning of prayer as it is revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We dare not say that such a definition is wrong, but it is too superficial and lacks both depth and accuracy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we desire to know what real prayer is today, we must clearly realize that it is not man merely making supplications before God for his own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We know that we should not judge any truth of the Bible merely on the basis of a single passage or aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same way, you cannot tell what a house looks like simply by one of its corners or rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You need to view it from various sides as a whole, and then you will be able to make an accurate judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same principle, if we collect all the Bible passages concerning prayer and view them as a whole, we will see that prayer is not just a matter of man making supplication to God because he has some needs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This may be partially the meaning of prayer but not entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have the time, we should gather all the specific examples of prayer in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, in the Old Testament there are the prayers of Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Nehemiah, Elijah, Isaiah, Daniel, and others, while in the New Testament there are the prayers of the Lord Jesus and of the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we study every one of these prayers and look at them as a composite, we will be able to see clearly what prayer is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not the intention of this writing to study them in such a detailed way; we will only use a simple word to speak concerning the meaning of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I. PRAYER IS THE MUTUAL CONTACT BETWEEN MAN AND GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Prayer is not just man contacting God; it is the mutual contact between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This matter of the contact between God and man is a very great subject in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have often said that the purpose of man's living is to be God's vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the universe God is man's content, and man is God's container.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without man, God has no place to put Himself He becomes a homeless God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not understand why this is so, but I know that it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the universe God's greatest need is man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God as an entity in Himself is complete, but as far as His operation in the universe is concerned, He still needs man to fulfill that operation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this you can understand the last sentence of Ephesians 1, which says that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The term fullness is very hard to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It not only denotes the fullness of Christ, but also implies the completeness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the church is, on the one hand, the fullness of Christ, and on the other hand, the completeness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, without the church it seems that Christ is not at all complete.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all must be very careful in understanding this word, for it can stir up vehement arguments in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not mean that God is incomplete and that He needs man to make Him complete.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What I mean is that God in Himself is perfectly complete, but without man He is not complete in the universe according to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Oh, brothers and sisters, this matter is too glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In His eternal plan, God has ordained man to be His vessel, or, in other words, to be His completion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, Genesis chapters one and two show us that when God created man He made two preparations concerning man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first preparation was that He created man in His image and according to His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As man was created according to God, he resembles God in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The various aspects of man's expression such as his pleasure, anger, sorrow, joy, preference, choice, etc. whether it be his emotion, will, or disposition express God to a certain degree and are miniatures of all that is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Another preparation was that God created for man a spirit in the depths of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of the countless varieties of living things in the universe, only man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The angels are spirits, but that is a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the whole creation there is one kind of created being that is not spirit yet has a spirit, and that is man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why did God create a spirit for man in the depths of his being?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all know it was because God wants man to receive Him, Who is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the same way He created a stomach for man because He wants man to take in food.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Consider this: suppose God did not create a stomach for man how could we take in food?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because we have a stomach, we can receive food into us, enjoy it, digest it, and assimilate it into our being, making it our constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the same manner, since we have a spirit within us, we can receive God into us and assimilate Him, making Him our very constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the first two chapters of Genesis, when God created man to be His vessel, He made these two steps of preparation: one step was to create man to be like Him, and the other was to put a spirit within man that man might receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After He had made these two preparations He placed Himself before man in the form of the tree of life in order that man might receive Him and obtain Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, it is in man's spirit that the contact between God and man is made.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Once there is such a contact between God and man, God enters into man to be his content, and man becomes God's vessel to express Him outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus God's eternal intention is fulfilled in man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please remember, a real prayer is the mutual contact between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Prayer is not just man contacting God, but also God contacting man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If in prayer man does not touch or contact God, and God does not touch or contact man, that prayer is below the proper standard.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Every prayer that is up to the standard is one which is a mutual flow and contact between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God and man are just like electric currents flowing into one another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is hard for you to say that prayer is solely God in man or solely man in God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to the fact and experience, prayer is the flowing between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every prayer that is truly up to the standard surely will have a condition of mutual flowing between God and man so that man may actually touch God and God may actually touch man; thus, man is united with God, and God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, the highest and most accurate meaning of prayer is that it is the mutual contact between God and man.</S>
