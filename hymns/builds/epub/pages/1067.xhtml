<div class='line'><b>1</b> There was One who was willing to die in my stead,</div>
<div class='line'>That a soul so unworthy might live,</div>
<div class='line'>And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,</div>
<div class='line'>All the sins of my life to forgive.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>They were borne on the cross,</div>
<div class='line'>They were borne on the cross,</div>
<div class='line'>O how much He was willing to bear!</div>
<div class='line'>With what anguish and loss,</div>
<div class='line'>Jesus went to the cross!</div>
<div class='line'>But He carried my sins with Him there.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> He is tender and loving and patient with me,</div>
<div class='line'>While He cleanses my heart of its dross;</div>
<div class='line'>But "there's no condemnation," I know I am free,</div>
<div class='line'>For my sins were all borne on the cross.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> I will cling to my Savior and never depart -</div>
<div class='line'>I will joyfully journey each day,</div>
<div class='line'>With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,</div>
<div class='line'>That my sins have been taken away.</div>
