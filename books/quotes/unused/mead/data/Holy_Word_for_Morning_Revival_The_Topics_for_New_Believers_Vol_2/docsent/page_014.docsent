   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 9 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 1:14 And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 Cor 15:45 ...The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rev 1:4 ...Grace to you and peace...from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Full Ministry of Christ in Three Stages</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To experience, enjoy, and gain Christ is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can do this only by being in the full ministry of Christ in His three divine and mystical stages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>60</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first stage incarnation revealed in the four Gospels Christ 61 was the Son of Man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>62 In the second stage inclusion covered in the twenty-two books from Acts to Jude Christ is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit....In the third stage intensification unveiled in the book of Revelation Christ is the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>63</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first stage of Christ s full ministry was the stage of His incarnation, from His birth through His human living to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>64 Simply speaking, in this stage...He accomplished four great things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, He brought God into man; second, He united and mingled God with man; third, He expressed God in His humanity and lived out God s attributes in His human living as His human virtues; and fourth, He accomplished His judicial redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>65</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second stage is the stage of His inclusion, from His resurrection to the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>66 In the stage of His inclusion, Christ accomplished three great things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, He was begotten as God s firstborn Son; second, He became the life-giving Spirit; and third, He regenerated the believers for His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>67 We need to see why we call it the stage of inclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His first stage He possessed only two elements divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was a little more complicated than what He had prior to His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before His incarnation, in eternity past, He possessed only one element divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the time of His incarnation, when He put on human nature, He possessed humanity in addition to His divinity; hence, He had two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After His death and resurrection, more elements were added to Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His resurrection, the last Adam, Christ in the stage of His incarnation, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This becoming made Him the Christ of inclusion, with the divine element and the human element included in Him, with the element of His death and its effectiveness included in Him, and with the element of His resurrection and its power included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, in the Old Testament there is the type of the holy anointing ointment Exo 30:22-25 ....The holy anointing ointment typifies the compound, life-giving Spirit whom Christ became in the stage of His inclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>68</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we want to see the third stage of Christ s full ministry, the stage of His intensification, from the degradation of the church to the consummation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>69 In the third stage...Christ is accomplishing three great things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, He is intensifying His organic salvation; second, He is producing His overcomers; and third, He is consummating the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>70</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In his Epistles, especially in 2 Timothy, Paul spoke thoroughly concerning the degradation of the church....</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first thing that happened in the degradation of the church was the turning away from the apostles teaching 2 Tim 1:15 ....Paul also said to pursue...with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not having a pure heart and not calling on the Lord also indicate the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Finally, Paul said, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Grace be with you 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not experience the Lord s being with our spirit and therefore lose the presence of grace, that is the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be careful about this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our highest enjoyment and experience is that our Lord is with our spirit....Today, Christ is the Spirit, and if we want to experience and enjoy Him, we must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>71</S>
