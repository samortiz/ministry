   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LETTERS FROM CHU CHI One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Shou Ling:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have twice received your letters; in my earthly loneliness, I have received comfort by the Lord's grace so that I could taste "gaining a hundredfold" in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the Lord's love I have received a copy of the book Worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Please do not send me another copy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have already read it, and it gave me much help concerning the truth of the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, whenever I thank the Lord, I often remember Sister Lee, the author.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The brothers in this locality desperately need the help of this book so that they can truly worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they do not get it, they will be, as I used to be, Christians who have never worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It has been two months since I moved to Chu Chi.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I went to the denominations and testified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord allowed me to gain a few brothers and sisters for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I used to misunderstand others and think that they stole sheep; now I am being misunderstood by others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is really too bad that I am not worthy of being misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I were, I think that in that day I would rejoice at being misunderstood!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The newly gained brothers and sisters are willing to tear down what they had before and build anew, but they are not very clear about the truth of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are as I used to be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They want the doctrine of Jesus but not His person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They want the grace of salvation, but they do not want the Lord who loves to give grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You know how immature I am I am not being polite.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although it is not a matter of the blind leading the blind, it is a matter of the newly born leading the newly born.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many things I cannot do, so I can only testify something of my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the rest, I keep the teaching: "Let your yes be yes, and your no, no."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I also have learned the secret of saying "I don't know" from Mr. Chang who begot me in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I once heard him say that he was going to travel for the work and intended to ask Mr. Nee for explanations to some matters of the truth in preparation for dealing with difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mr. Nee told Mr. Chang that he needed to take a few "I don't know's" on his trip.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This secret often becomes the answer in our prayer meeting every Wednesday from 7:00 to 9:00.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chu Chi is the central point of the Hangchow-Kiangsu Railway.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It has a population of five hundred thirty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The history of the denominations here is like that of Hangchow, but there is not a real, pure church to this date.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most marvelous thing is that the denominations in Chu Chi are almost finished for various reasons: The mission boards have stopped sending funds; some have gone bankrupt; people are worshipping in their homes because they have left the denominations over man's will; some denominations have also closed their doors for lack of attendants to listen to the preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a Jesus Church in the city the biggest and that has already sold its meeting place for thirty thousand dollars to an individual for his business.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is an Anglican Church, a Seventh-day Adventist Church, and a Catholic Church, but none have many members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, it appears that most of the members do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They come flushed with wine, and their cigarettes never leave their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some of their members even smoke opium, having come to the hospital to be cured.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who worship on the Lord's Day are mostly people hired by the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are there in body but not in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some glance sideways, while others take naps.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They take up the collection in two western metal plates.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The noise is really loud, but if you look inside, there are only copper pennies, no silver dimes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have heard that the most they collect is half a dollar or twenty or thirty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At first they thought that I was a member of the Anglican Church although I clearly stated that I left them ; therefore, they hoped that I would go back there, and they often asked me to go there to testify.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, recently they have paid attention to my actions, and their welcome is changing to a refusal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have heard that several pastors have criticized me as being one of Nee's group.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They say we only speak of salvation as a present matter and do not speak of works, causing people to become arrogant and complacent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They say people are vulnerable to our teaching and can easily become poisoned; furthermore, they say that the ones who are led astray are always the best members of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once a member of the group passes through, they steal the cream of a meeting and establish their own church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, once they learn about me, I cannot testify there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am now meeting in a brother's house.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This brother often criticized the denomination, so he gave up his position and left them long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The denominations do not care about him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to one brother, there are thirty or forty people who meet every night in Yang Chiu Nu's home in Plum Hill, about ten miles outside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Yang home in Village 18 has a meeting of thirty to forty believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Chu and Chen homes in Village 19 also have more than fifty people meeting together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They all left the denominations because they were not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They now meet in their own homes to worship the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They meet on the Lord's Day to sing hymns and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no responsible person, nor is there a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although they feel that the denominations are wrong, they do not understand the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have heard that they often come into the city to invite zealous preachers to their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They take care of food, lodging, and other expenses for the trip.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Hung Li in Hsu Village there is a brother called Chou Tien Tzu.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He does not read very much, nor has he believed in the Lord for very long, but his faith is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He often prays for people and heals them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Wherever he goes, the sick are healed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now there is a group of twenty to thirty completely new believers who have risen up to meet, sing hymns, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We really see that the harvest is great but the workers are few.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brother, please pray earnestly before the Lord of the harvest that He would send out workers to reap the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the few places I mentioned above, there are very few brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are mainly sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The sisters have heard of Miss Peace Wang and hope that she could come to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Until we meet again!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May your body, soul, and spirit be healthy in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your little brother,</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yu Hsiung Fei</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>November 23</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Note: Brother Yu used to live in the brothers' apartment in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He has fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is now working in the County Hospital in Chu Chi.</S>
