God has delivered us out of the world has brought us into Christ and has made Christ the good land to us that we may enjoy Him all the time
Besides the good land of Canaan and the tabernacle or temple, there is another figure in the Bible concerning our enjoyment of Christ
We all have to be a bride and a virgin to Christ experientially that we may enjoy Him and that He may enjoy us, that we may be one with Him
The Corinthians may have had the spiritual gifts and knowledge, yet Paul told them that they were still fleshly and soulish
Brother Watchman Nee once told us that 2 Corinthians may be considered as the autobiography of the Apostle Paul
A person may be able to speak fluently and eloquently and give many good illustrations and proverbs, but this is just a gift
Eventually, you will see the growth in life and the building of the saints in the places that these ones visit
Because even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our encouragement also abounds
Pray-reading these verses again and again will help us to see that what the church needs today is the ministry
The more that the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, the more encouragement or refreshment we will be able to enjoy
Paul told us that he and his co-workers were excessively burdened beyond their power or strength so that they 'despaired even of living'
When you are under a certain kind of suffering, never try to exercise your own strength to endure it by yourself
1:21-22 says that God has anointed us, has sealed us, and has given us the pledge, the foretaste, of the Spirit
We need the working of the cross because we have the anointing, the sealing, and the foretaste, the earnest, of the Spirit within us
If you have not been brought to an end, it will be very difficult for you to take care of the inner anointing and the inner sealing
The working of the cross is for the experience of the inner anointing, the sealing, and the inner enjoyment of the pledge of the Spirit
Since we have become believers, God is anointing Himself into us that we may have the divine elements dispensed into all our inward parts
God's anointing of Himself into us is so that we may be absolutely mingled with Him, with His divine elements, to be fully one with Him
The anointing imparts God's elements into us and the sealing forms the divine elements into an impression to express God's image
By the working of the cross with the inner anointing, sealing, and foretaste or pledge, we will have the adequate experience of Christ
The whole history of the children of Israel is a complete type of the experiences of the New Testament Christians
In chapter ten he told us that today we are enjoying the heavenly manna and are drinking the living water out of the cleft rock
When you are in your spirit, you are in the heavenlies because the heavenlies cannot be separated from your spirit
Although the Corinthians spoke much about spiritual things, the Apostle Paul designated them as fleshly and soulish
Some may talk about the heavenly things in Ephesians, but they do so as Corinthians-in the soul or in the flesh
Many know something about the Holy Spirit, but too few know about their human spirit in which the Holy Spirit dwells
In 2 Corinthians 1 Paul told us that he and his coworkers were excessively burdened beyond our power so that we despaired even of living
They had the sentence of death in themselves that they should not trust in themselves but in the very God who raises the dead
Thank the Lord that He is now in our spirit, calling us to forget about the soulish things and turn to our spirit to meet Him
If a husband's wife is not so nice to him, the first thing he usually does is to exercise his mind to consider his wife's situation
If we have really learned the lesson to trust no more in ourselves, we would not exercise our mind first but our spirit
We generally understand that wisdom has something to do with the mind, but Paul speaks of a kind of wisdom related to the flesh
He is working from within our spirit through our soul and body in order that our whole being will be under His working
Our conversation, our walk, our living in this world should not be something in our fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God
We have stopped all our doings and that it is now God who is working within us from our spirit through our soul and body
We have to be brought into the realization of our spirit, and we have to learn how to do everything in our spirit
Whatever we do, whatever we say, we have to be sure that we have the same spirit, that we are in the same spirit
The inward man is being renewed, refreshed, encouraged, and strengthened by being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life
The thoughts can be hardened by the self, blinded by the god of this age, or be captured by the ones who have the ministry
They are captured by those who war, who fight the battle, not according to the flesh but with the weapons which are powerful to God
Some people may come to you to challenge you to argue with them, but if you argue with them, you will only stir up their thoughts
In 2 Corinthians there are no miracles no healings and no gifts but suffering to reduce the outward man that the ministry might be produced
History has shown us that something may be built up by the gifts, but eventually what is built up will be torn down by the same gifts
After chapter one, the Apostle Paul starts to tell us what kind of person he is as he is living in the Holy of Holies
He mentions a number of aspects of such a person who is living in the presence of God, in the Holy of Holies, all the time
Of all, we have to be captives of Christ in the train, in the procession, of the celebration of Christ's victory
If we are going to live in the Holy of Holies, to enjoy Christ as the good land, to be in the spirit, we must first be captured by Christ
Truthfully speaking, many of us must admit that instead of us being captives to Christ, Christ is a captive to us
On the other hand, you are still an opponent, an enemy, to Christ because even until now your will has not been subdued or conquered
If you would only be willing to be defeated by the Lord, all the world and all the sins would be under your feet
We may think that we are serving the Lord in an absolute way, but we do not know how many rebellious elements are within us
Many seek for gifts of power, but what the church needs, what the world needs, is not a gifted person but a captured person
After Paul tells us that he is a captive in chapter two, he goes on to tell us that we have to be letters of Christ in 3:3
In 3:3 Paul said that 'you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God'
To be captured by Christ means that our emotions are subdued, our will is subdued, and even our desires are captured
Christ has been put into you , and as the Spirit He is within you to write the elements, the riches, of Christ into your whole being
If you are conquered, defeated, subdued, and captured by Christ, you will be a good piece of paper for the Spirit's writing
Now you need to be defeated, conquered, subdued, not doctrinally but practically in your mind, emotion, and will
It is not the knowledge of the letters, but the Spirit that gives life ; it is not the teachings, but the Spirit that gives life
If you consider that to read or to study the Word of God is merely to get some knowledge or teaching, you are absolutely wrong
To read and to study the Word is mainly to feed your inner man, to nourish your inner man, not merely to get the knowledge
Something of Christ will be inscribed into our mind our emotion our will and our whole person our whole being will become a letter of Christ
Eventually, the way will be paved for the indwelling Christ to write Himself gradually, little by little, into your being
Many Christians think that if they hear better messages to acquire more Bible knowledge, they will become better believers
He was a person taught by God, tested by God, and even trained by God not to live in the flesh but in the spirit
No one dreamed that the nation of Israel could be reformed or that Jerusalem could be returned to Israel in such a way
The fulfillment of this prophecy shows us that the Lord is preparing Israel and the church for His coming back
As the indwelling Spirit, He is now living, moving, acting, and even waiting for us to be reduced into the spirit
Paul forgave that brother in the person of Christ, according to the index of His whole person expressed in His eyes
Paul lived not only in the presence of the Lord but also in the index of the inward feelings and thought of Christ
He wanted to let the Corinthians know that he did not forgive according to himself or according to his flesh but in the person of Christ
He behaved himself in the person of Christ, in the face, in the thought, in the expression of the feeling and the thought of Christ
For whatever promises of God there are, in Him is the Yes; wherefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us'
We need to pray that the Spirit would help us to realize and to see what kind of person the Apostle Paul was when he was on this earth
We have no position, right, or standing to say anything apart from Christ because we have been crucified with Him
We may love the Lord and try to live by Christ, but how many of us practice this whenever there is a question for us to answer?
The Apostle Paul said that he entreated the Corinthians not in his own meekness or forbearance but in the meekness and forbearance of Christ
We all would say that we have to reject the lies and speak the truth, but have you ever asked yourself whose truth you speak?
Paul forgave in the person of Christ; he entreated in the meekness and forbearance of Christ; and he said the truth of Christ was in him
The veil in Hebrews 10 is the veil within the tabernacle , but the veil in 2 Corinthians 3 is the veil upon Moses' face
We may think that the Israelites in the Old Testament were foolish in many ways, and yet not realize that we are no different from them
All day long many of the Lord's seekers are hindered and veiled by religion, which keeps them from seeing something of the Lord Himself
The religious people condemned and sentenced the Lord Jesus to death according to their understanding of the Old Testament
The real deliverance from traditional religion is not something merely outward, but it is something in the spirit
When you are really walking, working, acting, and behaving yourself in the spirit, you are out of religion and traditions
If you are in the spirit, you are out of the denominations, out of the traditions, and out of any kind of religion
If you are not in the spirit, you may apparently be outside of religion, but you are actually still in your own religion
Your religion is a veil covering your eyes from seeing the light, the revelation, the visions in the New Testament
A man living in the spirit must be a captive of Christ, a letter of Christ, and a mirror turned to the Lord with an unveiled face
As we solely take care of the Spirit living within us, day by day and hour after hour, we will be transformed into the same image of Christ
As vessels we contain a wonderful treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything
If you read the first ten verses of chapter four carefully, you will realize that this vessel is exactly the same as a camera
Four main items needed for a camera to take any picture are the lens, the film, the shutter to open the camera, and the light
In the spiritual realm, the mind with all the thoughts is the lens, and a right spirit in a right heart is the film within
Now within you there is a picture, an image, and this image is the very treasure contained in these earthen vessels
Day and night we need to open ourselves to the Lord; then Christ, the heavenly, divine scenery, will be impressed into you again and again
In verse 7 it says that 'we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
To be a person in the spirit in the Holy of Holies, we need to be captives, letters, mirrors, and vessels to be broken
The highest authority in this universe is God, and God has given all the authority in heaven and on earth to Christ
For this highest authority there is the need of some ambassadors on this earth who are qualified to represent Him
The highest authority is Christ as the Head, and we as members of the Body have to be representatives of the Head
As an ambassador of Christ, Paul realized that whatever was within him, whatever he was, and whatever he had was mortal
A person is not qualified to be an ambassador of Christ by power, by gift, or by knowledge, but by the immortal life within him
Suppose that you hear a brother speak who is very eloquent, inspiring, and who has a great amount of knowledge
While you are listening to the speaking, you have to realize how much of God has been wrought into the speaker
You should not know him according to his eloquence, his knowledge, his gift, or according to what he teaches but according to the spirit
Another brother may share without any eloquence, yet you realize that with him there is a weighty measure of Christ
For two brothers to be co-workers is similar to binding their legs together so that together they have three legs instead of four
What the church needs is not a group of able workers but a group of people who are bound together with God, who are co-workers with God
Verses 4 through 10 of chapter six show us the qualifications, the proofs, and the signs that a person is a co-worker of God
If you consider that you are a co-worker of God, you need to ask yourself whether or not there have been evil reports about you
If you are really faithful to God and behave yourself as one with God, there will be many evil reports concerning you
If you are faithful to the Lord and honest with the church and saints, you will receive evil reports as well as good reports
As a part of the temple of God, you need to consider whether or not you are fully, thoroughly separated from all these negative things
Have you separated yourself from the unbelievers, from lawlessness, from darkness, from the enemy Satan, and from anything involving idols?
The idols and Belial will defile your spirit, so you have to separate yourself, purify yourself, from all the negative things
You may say that you are a part of the temple of God and yet still be yoked together in something with an unbeliever
Since we realize that we are the temple of God, we have to separate ourselves, to perfect holiness in the fear of God
The more she compares her husband to other men, the more she realizes that he is not as good as them in certain aspects
The Apostle Paul ministered Christ to others in a simple way, presenting Christ to them as their unique Husband
The tree of life is simple, but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil with the element of death is complicated
When Adam and Eve ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the Bible tells us that 'the eyes of them both were opened'
The eyes of Eve were really opened, showing us that it is better to have our eyes closed unto the simplicity which is toward Christ
All of the different teachings, differing from the apostles' teaching centered upon Christ and the church, cause much complexity
We need to be in the spirit, standing on the genuine ground of oneness, following the Lord in a simple way as a virgin
When you would consider taking another way to practice the church besides the way revealed in the holy Word, you are out of the spirit
Paul was jealous over the believers with a jealousy of God that they would be so simple toward Christ as their one Husband
They feel that we should be careful not to consider the church more than Christ and not to make the church an idol to ourselves
Today here on this earth we need to overcome all the problems to realize what the church life is that we may fulfill the Lords hearts desire
In 1:1 Paul said, 'To the church of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia'
We have seen that the temple is a corporate temple and that Paul betrothed the believers as one corporate virgin to Christ
They said he was crafty in making gain, indemnifying himself by sending Titus to receive the collection for the poor saints
If the brothers in your locality were to say that you were crafty and that you caught them by guile, you might want to leave that locality
A real, proper mother could be unhappy with her children, but she would not be offended and leave them because she loves them
If the church in your locality treated you in a bad way, it would be easy for you to have the attitude to withdraw from the church
Some brothers came to Brother Nee suggesting that they begin to meet in other places since the saints treated him in such a poor way
He charged these brothers to meet with the church and go on with the church regardless of how the church treated him
If you love the church, you would love it regardless of how it treats you simply because it is the expression of the Body of Christ
If we mean business with the Lord in having a local expression of His Body, we cannot have it in a way of indifference
We should not be vain talkers concerning the church life, but we need to be involved in the practical life of the church
In 2 Corinthians there is the aspect of loving the church and even more the aspect of tasting Christ, enjoying Christ, experiencing Christ
Paul received many visions and revelations he tells us that he was caught away to the third heaven and that he was caught away into paradise
It is not the visions and revelations that qualify us to be a lover of the church, but the experience, the tasting, the enjoyment of Christ
The Lord would not take the thorn away, however, in order that Paul might taste or enjoy Him as grace and experience His power
Sufferings and trials are often in the Lord's ordination for us, that we may experience Christ as grace and power
Today the church needs a group of brothers and sisters who are under the pressure, the thorn, to experience Christ in a practical way
It is through our experience of Christ as grace and power that we will have something real of Christ to minister to His Body, which we love
If we read the verses above carefully again and again, we can see what kind of spirit this man, the Apostle Paul, had
When we do things in our spirit, we are real and genuine because our real man, our real being, is in the spirit
Based on the Scripture reading, the first characteristic, the first virtue, of the spirit of this writer is its openness
You may open your mind, open your emotion, and even open your entire heart, yet you would still not open your spirit to others
When you are criticized, opposed, and looked down on by others, however, you will become as closed as 'a snail'
In 2 Corinthians the Apostle Paul opened himself up and spoke many things, yet we are impressed with how pure his spirit is
On the other hand, someone may tell you that he does not like you, but you realize that he loves you in his spirit
We need to be dealt with by the working of the cross so that we can be a person with a tender spirit like the Apostle Paul
He was coordinating all the time, trying to be one with the saints, one with the local churches, and one with the co-workers
We have to see how Christ as the grace of God is the very good land for us to enter into to enjoy to experience to partake of and to possess
We have to realize that in 2 Corinthians we see a group of people who have attained to the uttermost to fulfill God's purpose
There is no reference in 1 Corinthians to the good land of Canaan which the children of Israel eventually entered into and possessed
Although the term of the good land is not used in this book, spiritually speaking we can see the good land in 2 Corinthians
These persons entered into the land promised and given by God, and they were enjoying this land, which is Christ Himself
In 13:14 Paul says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
It may be that the term grace is quite familiar to us, but we may have a very shallow understanding of this term
Christ has come not merely to do something for us objectively, not merely to bring some good things from God to us freely
In 8:1 Paul said, 'Furthermore, we make known to you, brothers, the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia'
We might think that the grace given means that many good things were given to them by God, but the next verse shows us what this grace was
It may be that when we receive something given by God through others that we would say, 'Praise the Lord, this is a great grace'
Grace is not something received outwardly but Someone within, energizing, enabling, and strengthening us to do something for the Lord
The grace that Paul experienced was related to a thorn in the flesh which troubled and buffeted him all the time
If we were Paul, we might have argued with the Lord-'Lord, if Your grace is sufficient, it has to be sufficient to take the thorn away'
It is simply the Lord Himself within you, supporting you, energizing you, and strengthening you to face the trouble, to meet the situation
Whenever they opened their mouth to speak just a little bit, in their presence you had the sense that the Lord was there
Our human understanding cannot realize this because the divine thought, the divine concept, is very much different from ours
He asked the Lord many times to be gracious and merciful to him so that he would not have to work with this brother
The practical life of the Body of Christ could only come forth out of the enjoyment of Christ as the grace of God
The practical church life cannot be realized merely by teachings or visions but by the enjoyment of Christ as the grace of God
We have to be captives, letters, mirrors, vessels, ambassadors, co-workers, a temple, a virgin, lovers of the church, and tasters of Christ
The exercise of the spirit and pray-reading may not help you much because you are not yet subdued or captured by Christ
You will be a temple, wholly, thoroughly, and ultimately separated unto Him to perfect holiness in the fear of God
The three of the Godhead are one and love, grace, and fellowship are not three separate matters, but three aspects of one thing
The love of God is in the grace of Christ, and the grace of Christ with the love of God is in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
These riches for our enjoyment include the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the transmission of the Holy Spirit for our experience
He is the grace as the good land for our enjoyment to produce the temple for God's rest and the virgin for Christ's satisfaction
