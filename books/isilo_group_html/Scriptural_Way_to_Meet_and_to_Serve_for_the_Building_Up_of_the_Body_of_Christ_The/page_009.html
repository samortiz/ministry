<p>Another requirement on the believers for their meetings is that they must live and walk according to the spirit&mdash;to live a victorious life (Rom. 8:4). After making a thorough confession, we have to begin a new life. We should not fall back into our old life about which we have just confessed thoroughly. We must begin to have a new life, and this new life is to have our being absolutely in the spirit day after day and all day.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Let the Word of Christ Dwell in Us Richly</h2>
<p>We also need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col. 3:16). This is not only to read the word but also to receive the word and give it the freedom to act and operate in us. We must give ourselves to the word. We must let the word take us as its home so that it can work and operate within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Speak the Lord at All Times</h2>
<p>For our meetings, we also need to be those who speak the Lord at all times to all kinds of people on any occasion (Acts 8:4). We need to learn to speak. Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:2). Regardless of the situation or circumstances, we have to speak the Lord at all times to all kinds of people on any occasion. &ldquo;In season and out of season&rdquo; means opportunely or inopportunely, whether the opportunity is convenient or inconvenient, whether we are welcome or unwelcome.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Become Acquainted<br />
with Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs</h2>
<p>For our meetings, we must become acquainted with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs for teaching and admonishing one another (Col. 3:16b). We all have to learn the hymns in our hymnal. We may not be able to remember that many, but we can choose to remember the better hymns and learn to speak them. Sometimes we need to speak a hymn or a verse of a song to a certain person. We can do the same thing when we come to the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Pay the Price to Prepare to Speak</h2>
<p>The meetings also require us to pay the price to prepare to speak, not only to listen, in the meetings. This preparation is not like the preparation of a student who has been asked to give a speech. This might frighten most of us. We do not need to pay that kind of price. But day after day we must get ourselves prepared to have something. In the old way of meeting, one speaks and the rest listen. There is no need for the ones who listen to get themselves prepared. Today the way of meeting has been changed so that everybody has to speak. Thus, whenever we come to the meetings, we must get ourselves prepared. We should not prepare only instantly. We have to prepare constantly every day, every week, and every month. Then we will have an accumulation of the riches of Christ that we can speak of and with.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Endeavor to Make the Meetings<br />
Full of Mutuality</h2>
<p>We also need to endeavor to make the meetings full of mutuality. Many different persons should speak in the meetings. The more mutual the meeting is, the better it is. Suppose that fifty saints came together, and everybody wanted to speak at the same time. I wanted to speak before you, and you wanted to speak before me. That meeting would be in the third heavens. Suppose that the same fifty persons came together and all of them were dumb. Even the three elders among them could only look at one another with nothing to say. None of them could speak something to meet the need. That meeting would be a dead meeting. It would be dead to the uttermost. Instead of sitting there in dumbness, if everyone would open their mouths to speak something of Christ one after another, the meeting would become a living, uplifted meeting, full of the divine riches.</p>
<p>With only one speaker, there is only one course of food. Is a one course feast rich? When fifty saints come together, though, and everyone speaks, there is a fifty course feast full of riches. There will be exhortations, admonitions, revelations unveiling Christ, and other divine things. That is a meeting that is not only living but also rich. Some may say that the new way is too hard, but if we would try to speak, it is easy. If we do not speak, it is hard because everybody is dead. We must try to be living in the meeting, not dead. It would be good if we would make a pledge to speak for at least forty seconds whenever we are in any kind of meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Exercise the Spirit and to Be Energetic in Life</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we need to exercise the spirit and be energetic in life that the meetings may be high, rich, living, fresh, full of Christ, and enjoyable. If we are energetic in life, we may come to the meeting and say, &ldquo;Brothers, do you realize that I am a God-man? All of you are God-men too! Amen!&rdquo; We should not be in the meetings in our weak self. We must learn to exercise our spirit and be energetic. Then we will experience mercy reaching us and grace supplying us. This kind of exercise and energy in life will make the entire meeting very enjoyable. This is the way to fulfill the requirements of the proper meeting of the believers so that we can give praise to the Father. Then whatever we do will be a praise to the Father.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
