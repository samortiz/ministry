   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HOLDING MARRIAGE IN HONOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 4 says, Let marriage be held in honor among all, and the bed undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently this is unrelated to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, marriage is a very important factor in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether a church is sound and healthy or loses its element and essence is very much dependent upon the marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not consider the matter of marriage to be a light thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must hold it in honor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that we must possess our body, our vessel, in sanctification and honor 1 Thes 4:3-4 , that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter 1 Thes 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church life, the brothers and sisters must contact one another in a holy way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that we honor our marriage and others marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To honor marriage means to possess our body in sanctification and honor and to flee fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the church life, contacts between the brothers and sisters are unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, for our protection from falling into defilement, we must hold marriage in honor and not behave loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a matter which seriously affects our birthright in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Reuben lost it due to his defilement Gen 49:3-4; 1 Chron 5:1 , and Joseph received it because of his purity 1 Chron 5:1; Gen 39:7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God will judge fornicators and adulterers, and the church also must judge them 1 Cor 5:1-2, 11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nothing damages the saints and the church life so much as this defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 4 says that God will judge the fornicators and adulterers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews is a book concerning God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The holy God will never tolerate any defilement among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will judge His people 10:30; 12:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>V. WITHOUT LOVE OF MONEY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 5 says, Let your way of life be without love of money, being satisfied with your circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Surely money-lovers cannot enter into the reality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every money-lover is a Judas, a traitor, betraying the Lord, the Lord s testimony, and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is impossible for such a person to live the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 5 also tells us to be satisfied with our circumstances, for the Lord has said, I will by no means cease to uphold you, neither by any means will I forsake you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be satisfied with whatever we have and with whatever circumstances we are in, knowing that we have the Lord and that we can trust in Him for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should always be satisfied with our circumstances that we may not be distracted from the church life by mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since we have the Lord as our helper, we should be content and at peace that we may be fully kept in the enjoyment of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, I, an old man, can give a strong word of testimony to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can assure you that you have no need to worry about your living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our God is our Father, and He knows all we need.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can still remember the day when the Lord forced me to give up my job for His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I had been struggling with the Lord about this for approximately three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On that last day, August 23, 1933, I went to the Lord at midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before that time, I had received from Him the word in Matthew 6:33, which says that if we seek God s kingdom and righteousness, the Lord will add to us whatever we need for our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That night I went to the Lord to make a thorough deal with Him about whether it was His will that I leave my job for the sake of full-time ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when I went to Him, He did not give me time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He just rebuked me, telling me that He had already given me a word from Matthew 6.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said, If you believe it, take it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you don t believe it, that s all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suddenly I had the feeling that the Lord had left me and that His presence was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was unable to pray any further.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I could not even say, In the name of the Lord Jesus, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As I was kneeling there, I wept and said, Okay, Lord, I take Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From that day until now, I have never lacked anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord knows our need.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may have the peace to sacrifice everything for the Lord and for the church life, not worrying about our living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As long as we enter within the veil and go outside the camp, the Lord will take care of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is our Helper and He never forsakes us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our responsibility is to live in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our life is in Him, and our living is in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praise Him that He is so living and real!</S>
