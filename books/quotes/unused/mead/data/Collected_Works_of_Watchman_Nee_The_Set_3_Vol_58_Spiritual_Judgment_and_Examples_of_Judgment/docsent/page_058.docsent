   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 38 Date:August 16, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER F. T.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved in 1925 at the Bible school established by Sister Dora Yu in Jiang-Wan, Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My mother and husband passed away, and I lost all interest in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Two years later I returned to Canton and began meeting at a sister's house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once I met Brother Nee's mother, who told me the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I began to have a desire to serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After World War II, I returned to my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It had third-and-fourth-generation, nominal Christians there who did not know any truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After I explained the truth to them, they were saved in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later we began to meet and break bread in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What I have heard this time on the mountain has caused me to condemn myself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of my prayers are prayers of confession.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the Lord's blood, I cannot lift up my head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I thought that I was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now I realize that I am poorer than I realized.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are two aspects to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One is supernatural, and the other is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One is God's power manifested in the environment, and the other is God's power manifested in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One is outward work, and the other is inward crafting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One is God answering our prayers, and the other is God molding our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One is outward, and the other is inward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two aspects result in two different kinds of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Among God's children some pay attention to prayer, work, and supernatural things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their eyes are on God's arranging hand in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These ones know grace in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Others pay attention to inward dealings, inward teachings, inward light, the inward experience of God's hand, and the inward spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We wish our sister would realize that according to the revelation of the New Testament God wants to establish us in the inward spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every outward thing that God has done is for the purpose of building up the inward things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Outward answers to prayer, outward arrangements, outward deliverances, and outward care are all for the purpose of edifying the inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is good that you can come to the mountain and listen to all the testimonies and things concerning the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's children, however, face a greater danger than backsliding caring only for the outward concerns and blessings while missing the inward fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a man receives many answers to prayer and deliverance in the midst of his warfare, we can say that God has shown mercy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if a man only sees the outward care yet misses God inwardly, he is in a dreadful state.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once God's children are stuck with only outward blessings, they have fallen to the standard of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Christian blessings in the New Testament are spiritual, inward, and intrinsic.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The blessings spoken of in Ephesians 1 are all spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament Christians receive inward blessings, not outward ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Leviticus 26 God promised the Israelites that they could be spared from many sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today there are many who have received the blessing of health.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are also many who have become sick and yet have received inward spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Christ we have inward blessings as well as outward blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a person only has outward blessings, he is standing on Jewish ground.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not want any outward blessing to frustrate our inward progress.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God pays attention today to spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether we receive blessing or chastisement, we have to understand God's way with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we understand it, we will be enlightened within, and this will be genuine Christian salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God wants to turn us daily from outward blessings to inward blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether our outward circumstances are smooth or rough, everything should turn around eventually and become our inward blessing, including what apparently seems to be God's rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we take this way, we will be full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul prayed for the removal of his outward thorn; this was a prayer for outward blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord did not answer this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead He said, "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Paul heard this word, he rejected the outward blessing for the inward blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God allowed the thorn to remain in order that Paul would know what weakness meant, what sufficient grace meant, and what the Lord's power being perfected through man's weaknesses meant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The outward thorn brought him spiritual profit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must learn to take the inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not be distracted to take the outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord is always taking us by the hand to go the inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to be clear about this way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to know what genuine Christian salvation is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to learn to accept the inward blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes the Lord perfects us through answering our prayers, but sometimes He perfects us through not answering our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not have to pay too much attention to whether or not the Lord has answered our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We only have to see whether or not we have received any spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is no doubt that we have to know the Lord through the outward things, but we must see Him through the inward things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we do this, our way will not only be straight, but we will be able to be a guide to others.</S>
