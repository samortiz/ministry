   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jesus Christ, the God-man</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eventually that type was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord Jesus came, God came.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," and this Word became flesh John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know this is Jesus in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He came in the incarnation, He "tabernacled" v. 14 . This indicates that He Himself as the living tabernacle was the fulfillment of the tabernacle in Exodus 40.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jesus as the tabernacle is not a building but a living, organic Person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This One who is the tabernacle is a divine Person, a wonderful Person, a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first impression the Bible gives concerning the tabernacle is that it is an organic thing, an organic person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even more it is an organic human mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The tabernacle is the God-man, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the end of the Bible is the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of the tabernacle Rev 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tabernacle in the two Testaments, both Old and New, is actually a living person of two natures the human nature and the divine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus was a man composed of divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Holy Spirit is the divine element, the divinity, and the human virtue is the human element, humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Jesus' conception is of the divine element in the human element.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This conception brought forth a child of two natures divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This child was not only human. but also divine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was a God-man, and this God-man was the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let me stress strongly that this is a tabernacle in the biblical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible the tabernacle is a living person as a composition of the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of this, the New Jerusalem cannot be a literal city, nor can it be a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the biblical sense, tabernacle means a living person as a composition of divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Tabernacle and the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Israel first built the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then when they entered into the good land, God revealed to them through David 2 Sam 7:2, 5-13 that He wanted to have something solid and not portable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The tabernacle was a "portable" house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It could satisfy God temporarily but not permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wanted something solid built on a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The temple was not movable or portable, but something settled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>David knew God's heart and prepared all the materials for the building of the temple 1 Chron 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God had given him a son, Solomon, who would build the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This temple was the enlargement of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When it was finished, the things from the tabernacle were brought into the temple 2 Chron 5:1, 5 , indicating that the two were actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus in John 1:14 is revealed as the tabernacle, but in John 2:19-21 He indicates that He is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" v. 19 . Jesus' word here indicates that His body was the real temple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When He said He would raise up the temple in three days, we know He raised up a house of God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The house of God that Jesus built up in resurrection is not only Himself but includes His believers also Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus this temple built in and by the resurrection of Jesus is a corporate one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This temple is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is the temple 1 Cor 3:16 .</S>
