   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Nadab and Abihu were sons of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Aaron was the high priest chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What these two men did was not rebellion and resistance against God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were burning incense to serve God and please God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But they did something that God had not commanded, something that God had not ordained; therefore, they received God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sons of Aaron assumed that since God had not forbidden the use of other fire to burn the incense, that strange fire would surely be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They did not realize that, in the matter of serving God, we should not do something that God has not specifically commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They did not realize how strict God is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In God's work whatever He has not commanded, He forbids.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If men do it, they commit a mistake and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because these two committed such a presumptuous sin, God slew them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although they were the sons of Aaron and were priests waiting on God, He could not forgive them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What they did was not cheating, law-breaking, fornication, or robbery, as was the case with the sons of Eli.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They did not rebel against an obvious command from God to intentionally commit what God had forbidden.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, they purposely intended to serve God and please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They purposely and personally prepared two censers and used the fire they brought to light the incense, assuming that they would gain God's favor in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Little did they realize that, even though their intention was good, they were following their own idea in coming before God to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did what God had not commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Little did they know that doing something beyond God's will is sin and offends God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In every matter concerning God's service, God does not consider something good merely because our intention is good.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our intention may be good, but if we act presumptuously, God will still punish us for the presumptuous sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may not see much severity in God's dealing with us in our work today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the numerous works that come out of strange fire will be consumed before the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May God open our eyes to realize what is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only are fornication, robbery, deceitfulness, extortion, unrighteousness, and filthiness sins, even "doing God's work," "preaching to save souls," "rendering help to others," and "leading others," are also sins if they are not done according to God's command.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God will judge these sins just as He will judge the sins of unrighteousness and filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever you do apart from God's command is a service of strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The record in 1 Samuel 13:8-14 concerning Saul's offer of the burnt offering should be a great warning to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There were three reasons why Saul made the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, he saw the people scattering away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, Samuel did not come at the appointed time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Third, his enemies, the Philistines, had pitched in Michmash and gone down to Gilgal to fight against him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, he took it upon himself to offer the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Saul did not commit a sin of fornication, robbery, or extortion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was just making an offering to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In his heart he was afraid God would not be pleased if he did not make supplication.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>So he thought if he made more supplication, God would certainly accept him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He assumed that if he could do a little more service to Jehovah, he would be able to deliver the people out of the hands of the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not realize that this was not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee" 1 Sam 13:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Therefore said I" was not God's command v. 12 . God wants us to serve Him according to His instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He does not want us to work according to "I thought" and "I assume."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everything that is done according to what one thinks or assumes is altogether rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What God wants is that man would be after His heart's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What God stresses is not what we have done, but what we have made subject to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Obeying is better than offering burnt offerings, and hearkening is better than the fat of rams.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are oftentimes like Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We rush into many things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We believe that God would not delay, so we do not wait for God's time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We only see our need and the need of the circumstance; we forget to wait for God's time and rush into things which God has not commanded us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers, Saul lost his throne because he was too enthusiastic, too hasty to supplicate, and too eager to sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But how justifiable were his reasons for doing this!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet God said, "I would seek a man after My own heart and anoint him to be king."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God does not want a man who can barely wait or who can labor in many works.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God does not want outstanding people or fruitful people who can save and revive many.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, He wants some who are after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If it were up to us, we would surely prefer a person like Saul because he was an outstanding man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Saul was anointed king and stood among the people, "he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward" 1 Sam 10:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We only care for the outward appearance of man, while God does not want a man with an attractive face, but one who seeks after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May our goal never be great performances that please others and ourselves, but rather be touching God's heart and pleasing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only this kind of person can be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is seeking after this very kind of person.</S>
