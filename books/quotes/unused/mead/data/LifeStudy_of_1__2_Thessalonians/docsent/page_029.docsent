   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TERMINATION OF EVERYTHING NEGATIVE, NATURAL, AND OLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen a little of what it means for the church to be in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us go on to consider what it means for the church to be in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a great matter to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be in Christ means that there is no sin, flesh, self, natural life, old creation, death, or Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are in Christ, everything negative has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin, death, the self, the flesh, Satan, and the old creation have all been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For those who are in Christ everything other than God has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we realize what has been terminated in Christ, we shall know that it is shameful for so-called churches to designate themselves by certain names.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, in China there was a group called the American Presbyterian Church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Recently in southern California I saw a sign which read "The Orange County Chinese Taiwanese Church."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A brother recently told me about a group called the San Francisco Chinese Mennonite Church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no room for any such names or designations in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who take a name such as these indicate by doing so that they are not the church in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fact that they have a name indicates that many things among them have not been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This implies that with respect to the church everything natural, everything negative, everything of the old creation, has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that in the church there are no Chinese or Americans, no Japanese or Koreans, no French or Germans.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the church there is room only for Jesus Christ the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the significance of the church being in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We in the Lord's recovery claim to be practicing the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we make such a claim, however, we need to check to see whether we are still holding to our culture or disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Regarding this matter, sometimes we expect others to sympathize with us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On occasion sisters have said to me, "Brother Lee, don't forget that we are sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Bible, we sisters are weaker vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in the Lord Jesus Christ there are no weak vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we should not expect anyone to sympathize with our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as you want others to sympathize with you, that is an indication that in your experience you are not buried with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the church to be in the Lord Jesus Christ in a practical way, we all need to be terminated and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to die and then be placed in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is to be in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I say this, does it seem that I am comparing the Lord Jesus Christ to a tomb?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Listen to what Paul says in Romans 6:3: "Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse clearly says that to be baptized into Christ is to be baptized into Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How, then, can we be in Christ without also being in His death?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be in Christ is to be buried, terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you like to hear such a word?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether we like to hear it or not, it is the truth that to be in Christ is to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During special times of conference or training, saints come together from different cities and regions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Outwardly, no one says anything in favor of his locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But deep within we may be proud of coming from a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our heart we may say, "You have to realize that we are from such-and-such place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our place is the best."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To think in this way is to exalt ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we claim to be of a certain place, we are excluding ourselves from the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church must be only in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
