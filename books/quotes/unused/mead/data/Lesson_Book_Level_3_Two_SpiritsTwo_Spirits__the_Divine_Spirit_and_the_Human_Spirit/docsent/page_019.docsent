   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Not Separate from Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Holy Spirit today is the seven eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians argue that the Holy Spirit of God is separate from Christ, but the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you think of your eyes as being separate from you?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is ridiculous to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I look at your eyes, I look at you, and when you look at me with your eyes, you look me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The eyes of a person express that person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To say that the Holy Spirit is separate from Christ does not correspond with the pure revelation of the Holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Day by day, we sense that Someone is looking at us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This Someone is the Spirit, who is Christ Himself....Our Christ is not a blind Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the Christ with the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Often, He transfuses His elements into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At other times, He observes us like a flashlight, saying, "What are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Are you fighting with your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Stop!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have you not had this kind of experience?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Day by day we experience this watching, observing, and transfusing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This watching, observing, and transfusing take place through His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His eyes are the Spirit, and the Spirit is simply Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not believe it, you will miss the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS, SEVEN LAMPS,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>AND SEVEN EYES FOR GOD'S BUILDING A. The Lamps and the Building</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The lamps in Exodus 25 are for the building up of the tabernacle, especially for the move in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without light, it is impossible to move.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The light is for the move, and the move is for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seven lamps, therefore, are for the building up of the tabernacle, God's dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seven lamps in Zechariah 3 and 4 are for the recovery of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principle is the same in the rebuilding of the temple as it was in the building of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same is true of the book of Revelation....Revelation begins with the seven local churches and it ends with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although this book contains the judgment of God, this judgment is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Judgment is not for judgment; it is for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Jerusalem, God's eternal dwelling place, issues out of this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. The Stone with Seven Eyes</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Zechariah 3:9 says, "For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Revelation 5, the seven eyes are of the Lamb, but in Zechariah they are upon a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, "And I say also unto thee, That thou art a stone, and upon this rock I will build my church" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>. Here the Lord refers to Himself as the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Matthew 21:42 He said, "Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The stone referred to here is the very stone with the seven eyes in Zechariah 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The verses show us clearly that the stone is just Christ Himself and that this stone is related to the building of God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is the Lamb-stone with seven eyes for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>C. Cleansing and Infusing</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because your condition is not pure, some of you are still under the seven burning lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are still involved with certain things that need to be searched and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Mainly we are not under the flaming lamps, but under the infusing eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are you under the searching lamps or the infusing eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am happy to be under the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose you are about to quarrel with your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The seven eyes will immediately become the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At such a time, you need to repent and say, "O Lord Jesus, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am still in the flesh, and I am so pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Lord, thank You for Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I confess my failure and I apply Your blood to my situation."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever you do this, the seven lamps turn into the seven eyes looking at you, and immediately you are once again under His transfusing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ's essence and certain of His attributes are transfused into your being.</S>
