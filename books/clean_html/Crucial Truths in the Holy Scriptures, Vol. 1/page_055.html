<h2 class="head3">From Satan</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Release to the captives,...and...release those who are oppressed&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 4:18; cf. Acts 10:38).</p>
<p>In the past, we were Satan&rsquo;s captives under his oppression. The death of the Lord on the cross destroyed Satan and released us from under his hand, giving us freedom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:13; see also Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>Satan has a kingdom, and he controls all the people in his kingdom. The authority of darkness in Colossians 1:13 is the kingdom of Satan. When we were sinners, we were in his kingdom of darkness and under his authority and cruel control. When we believed and received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation through His Holy Spirit of power and His resurrection life, the Lord delivered us out of the kingdom of darkness, that is, out from under Satan&rsquo;s authority. He also transferred us into His own kingdom of light, making us His children of light who enjoy freedom in the light.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 3:3; see also John 17:15; Matt. 6:13).</p>
<p>Satan is evil, so the Bible calls him the evil one. In the past we were ill-treated and corrupted under his hand. The Lord delivered us out from under his hand, and He will also establish us and guard us from him. This was the Lord&rsquo;s prayer for us as He was about to leave the world, and it should be our frequent prayer. God is faithful, and He will accomplish this thing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">From the World</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:4).</p>
<p>The present evil age is the part of the world that is before our eyes; it is used by Satan to seduce, cheat, and control people. In the past, we were under the seduction of the present evil age, we were tricked by Satan to come under his control, and we were unable to keep ourselves from following the customs and fashions of this evil age. The Lord offered Himself up and accomplished redemption not only to deliver us from sin and Satan but also to deliver us from the present evil age, which is the world under Satan&rsquo;s hand. He delivers us out of the customs and fashions of this evil age so that we may have freedom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You died with Christ from the elements of the world&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:20).</p>
<p>The elements of the world are the religious ordinances and philosophies of the world (cf. vv. 8, 21-22). Satan, through human wisdom and cleverness, invented the religions, ordinances, and philosophies in the world to keep men in bondage. Since we are joined to the Lord and died together with Him to escape the world, we were also delivered from the bondage of worldly religions, ordinances, and philosophies. Now we enjoy the freedom of His salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<p>The world is filled with all kinds of corruption. This corruption comes from human lusts. People live in corruption and give their lusts free rein. Before we were saved, we lived in our lusts and could not stop ourselves from fulfilling them. When the Lord saved us with the life of God, we were delivered from the corruption which is in the world by lust. Now we enjoy freedom in God&rsquo;s holy nature.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You were redeemed from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:18-19).</p>
<p>The vain manner of life of the people of the world has been handed down from their fathers. It has been passed on from generation to generation, so it is hard to escape. The redemption accomplished by the Lord on the cross and the precious blood He shed brought us back to God. This delivered us from the vain manner of life in the world passed on to us through the generations. We have been freed to live in God&rsquo;s holiness.</p>
