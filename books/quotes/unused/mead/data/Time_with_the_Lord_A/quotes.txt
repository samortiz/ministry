[1]  According to the present situation nearly all Christians know how to study, memorize, meditate, and search the Scriptures for knowledge, but very few know how to come to the Word of God to enjoy the Lord and to receive spiritual nourishment.
[2]  As people who have God living within them, we need to set aside some time each day to come to the Word of God to enjoy Him, to feed upon Him, and to receive spiritual nourishment.
[3]  Even half an hour for reading and praying is too short, but surely we can spend half an hour with the Lord every day to pray-read His Word, and the best time for this is in the morning.
[4]  This thirty minutes daily should be spent not asking the Lord to do many things, but simply staying in communion with Him and enjoying Him.
[5]  If we do not know how to pray-read, we will pray in the following way: first, we will rise early in the morning, feeling that we must pray.
[6]  Then we will try to pray like this: "Lord, I thank You that You are so good...that You have given me peace...that You have protected me from all kinds of danger..."
[7]  O Lord, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.'"
