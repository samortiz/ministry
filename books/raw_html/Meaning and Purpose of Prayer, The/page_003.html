        <h2 class="head2">To Express God</h2>
<p>The first meaning of prayer is to absorb God, and the second meaning is to express God. Both of these meanings are related. To express God means to let Him speak, that is, to let God be expressed. Prayer is not our speaking or expressing ourselves. Prayer is our letting God speak and express Himself.</p>
<p>In Genesis 18 Abraham prayed for Lot and also for Sodom (vv. 23-33). However, the end of that chapter says, &ldquo;Jehovah went away as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham&rdquo; (v. 33). Although it was Abraham who prayed, it was Jehovah who spoke. It was Jehovah who finished speaking and who expressed His intention.</p>
<p>Whenever we pray, we should let God speak and let Him finish speaking. In the New Testament Martha had much to say. When Martha&rsquo;s brother, Lazarus, died and the Lord came, Martha did not let the Lord speak first. As soon as she saw the Lord, she said, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died&rdquo; (John 11:21). The Lord said to her, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live...Do you believe this?&rdquo; (vv. 25-26). Martha replied, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 27). What Martha said did not correspond with what the Lord revealed to her. Because she kept speaking, the Lord&rsquo;s words could not get into her. Everything she said was an expression of herself. That was not real prayer; it was man&rsquo;s natural crying out. Real prayer is our coming to God and letting God speak and express Himself instead of speaking our own words and expressing ourselves. We are often like Martha in our prayer. Our only care is to express ourselves, not to let God express Himself.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should not say anything when we pray. We should speak when we pray; however, the question is, What do we say? In our prayer we should say what God is saying within us. God speaks within us, and to pray is to repeat what He has spoken back to Him. This is the principle of Psalm 27:8: &ldquo;When You say, Seek My face, / To You my heart says, Your face, O Jehovah, will I seek.&rdquo; Such prayer is according to God&rsquo;s speaking within us. Therefore, the words we utter in prayer are an expression of the speaking within us. Without is man&rsquo;s speaking, but within is God&rsquo;s speaking. Once God speaks within, we speak without. Prayer is not our asking for something through speaking; it is our expressing what God has spoken within us. Hence, our prayer becomes God&rsquo;s expression. This is real prayer.</p>
<p>For example, we hear that the church needs to pray for a certain special meeting or for the revival of the church. Just as we begin to pray, we sense a word from the Lord telling us something concerning our inner condition and our situation. We should stop praying and forget about the revival of the church or the special meeting and follow the inner sense; we should speak the words that the Lord has spoken. If we sense the Lord&rsquo;s rebuke, saying, &ldquo;You are full of the flesh,&rdquo; we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am full of the flesh.&rdquo; If we sense that the Lord is saying, &ldquo;You are full of the self,&rdquo; we should immediately say, &ldquo;Lord, I am full of the self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are times when we let God speak, and we pray forth our inner sense. However, only a portion of our prayer is according to the inner expression, because we add many of our own cries. This is our being tempted to beseech God for something. God may give us the sense that we are full of the flesh and the self, but we often add many things when we pray according to this sense. For example, we may pray, &ldquo;Lord, cause me not to have the flesh any longer and not to be in the self.&rdquo; The problem is that such a prayer is our own crying out; it is not an expression of the speaking from within. Sometimes instead of touching the inner sense, we ask God to do things according to what we think. Such prayers are vain.</p>
<p>In Psalm 27:4 David said that he desired to behold the beauty of Jehovah and &ldquo;inquire in His temple.&rdquo; David did not say &ldquo;cry out&rdquo; or &ldquo;beseech&rdquo; but &ldquo;inquire.&rdquo; To inquire is to ask God. Abraham&rsquo;s prayer in Genesis 18 is a good example of inquiring. When God told Abraham that He would judge the sinful city of Sodom, Abraham said, &ldquo;Will You indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed destroy...it?&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). We would have said, &ldquo;God, You must save Sodom. There are fifty righteous men in that city; hence, You must save them.&rdquo; Abraham did not pray in this way; rather, he inquired about what God would do if there were fifty righteous men in the city, and what He would do if forty-five were righteous, and God told Abraham what He would do. When Abraham inquired about ten righteous men, God said, &ldquo;I will not destroy it, because of the ten&rdquo; (vv. 28-32). By this, Abraham understood God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>Although it was Abraham who continued to inquire in that prayer, it was mainly God speaking, not Abraham. Hence, at the end of the chapter the Bible says, &ldquo;Jehovah went away as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham&rdquo; (v. 33). The best and most valuable prayer is not one in which we speak but one in which God speaks. The best and most valuable prayer is not one in which we cry out or beseech but one in which we inquire and let God speak. To cry out is to tell God the things of man, but to beseech is to beg for the things of God. The best prayer is to inquire. To inquire is to let God speak so that the words spoken are God&rsquo;s speaking within man, God&rsquo;s expressions. This is the best prayer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to pray means to absorb God and to express Him. Every prayer should touch God and let Him pass through us and be expressed. When we pray in this way, we will be anointed by God and be mingled more with Him. Then we will know that God is our everything. We will also see that He is always with us and is our supply in every need.</p>

	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
