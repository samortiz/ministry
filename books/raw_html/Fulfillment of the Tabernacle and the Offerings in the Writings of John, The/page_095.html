<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN NINE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 9:1-41; 6:33; 7:38-39; 8:12</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the signs in chapter nine of the Gospel of John. This chapter contains an interesting story, a story of the Lord’s giving sight to a man who was blind from birth. According to verses 6 and 7, the Lord Jesus “spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay, and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which translated means sent). So he went and washed and came seeing.”<p>When I was young, I thought that this story was rather amusing. I thought that it was very unusual for the Lord to spit on the ground, make clay of the spittle, and then anoint the blind man’s eyes with the clay. Then He told the blind man to walk a distance to the pool of Siloam, and there to wash away the clay from his eyes. I could not understand the significance of this story.<p>The Gospel of John is a book of signs. In chapter one we have the sign of the Lamb with a dove upon Him (1:29, 32); in chapter two, the sign of the changing of water into wine (2:1-11); in chapter three, the sign of a brass serpent lifted up on a pole (3:14); in chapter four, the sign of Jacob’s well at the foot of a mountain (4:6, 20); in chapter five, the sign of the pool of Bethesda around which lay many who were sick, blind, lame, and withered (5:1-3). All these signs are pictures with a particular spiritual significance. The case of the Lord’s giving sight to the blind man in chapter nine is also a sign with spiritual significance.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF A BLIND MAN TO MANIFEST THE WORKS OF GOD</h2><p>John 9:1 says, “And as He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.” This signifies that as fallen people, descendants of Adam, we all were born blind.<p>I would ask you to consider your situation before you were saved. Before you were saved, you did not know where you came from or where you were going. You did not know the significance of the universe, and you did not know yourself. You did not know these things, because you were born blind. I can testify that I was born blind. As one who was blind from birth, I did not know spiritual things before I was saved. Is it not true that you also were born blind?<p>According to 9:2, the Lord’s disciples said to Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?” The disciples’ question indicates that they still held certain religious concepts. According to their concept, they regarded this man’s blindness as being the result of some sin committed either by him or by his parents.<p>The Lord answered His disciples by saying, “Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him” (v. 3). Here the Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, “Do not ask whose fault it is that this man is blind. You ask whose sin caused him to be blind. But I say that neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but this blindness is that the works of God might be manifested in him. You need to drop your religious concept.”<p>We all were born blind, but our blindness gives the Lord an opportunity to manifest the works of God in us. How wonderful that God has the opportunity to manifest His marvelous works in us! Our blindness gives Him a good opportunity to manifest His works. Therefore, we may say to the Lord, “Lord, without me, You would not have this opportunity to manifest Your works. If I had not been born blind, You would not have the way to manifest Your wonderful works in me. Lord, my blindness gives You an opportunity to express Yourself in Your works.”
