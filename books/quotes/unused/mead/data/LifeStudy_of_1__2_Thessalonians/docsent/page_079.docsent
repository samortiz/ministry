   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF THE HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The soul is the person himself, but the heart is the person in action.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that whenever you act, you act by your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we may say that our heart is our representative in action.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have something in our inner being that represents us, and this representative is our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a brother says to his wife, "Dear, I love you," this means that his heart loves her.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, whenever we hate something, it is our heart that does the hating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we enjoy something or dislike something, it is our heart that enjoys or dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, our heart is our representative, the acting commissioner or ambassador, of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the heart is our representative, Solomon says in Proverbs 4:23, "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To keep our heart is actually to guard it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Hebrew word rendered "keep" means guard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should guard our heart above all because out of it are the issues of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Issues" here implies sources and springs as well as issues.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the heart is related to the sources of life, the springs of life, and the issues of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First we have the source, then the spring, and then the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Out of the heart come all the issues of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As human beings, we have life, and this life acts through our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Using the illustration of electricity and a switch, we may say that the heart is the switch of our inner being, of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the flow of electricity depends on the switch, so our daily living is dependent on what our heart switches on and off.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our heart is the switch of our human life, of our daily life, of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word "life" in Proverbs 4:23 implies an organic element, the element of life; it also implies our daily living and activities, in fact, our entire human life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the word life in this verse is inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As human beings, we have a human life, and this human life has an organic element and also a daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The switch of this life is the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose as a brother is studying the Bible he is disturbed by the barking of a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Bothered by this sound, he shouts at the dog.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The thought and intent of shouting at the dog has its source in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It also springs from the heart and issues from it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As he is reading the Bible and is disturbed by the dog's barking, something within this brother's heart motivates him to shout at the dog.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shouting is an issue that springs out from the source of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is an illustration of the heart as the acting representative of our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The activities and movements of our physical body depend on our physical heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In like manner, our daily living depends on our psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way we act and behave depends on the kind of heart we have.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A RENEWED HEART</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we are fallen and sinful, our psychological heart is corrupt and deceitful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Jeremiah 17:9, our heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A better translation of the Hebrew would say "incurable" instead of desperately wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our heart is corrupt, rotten, to such an extent that it is incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the condition of the psychological heart of all descendants of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Turning to God</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But God in His salvation promises to give us a new heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ezekiel 36:26 says, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The new heart in this verse does not refer to another heart; it refers to a renewed heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first characteristic of this renewed heart is that it turns to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The turning of our heart to God is a very healthy sign that He has renewed it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A corrupt heart is always away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our heart is away from Him, that is an indication that our heart is still corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some may ask how they can know if their heart has been renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sign of a renewed heart is that it turns toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The sign of a corrupt heart is that it turns away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, we can know if our heart has been renewed by whether it is turned to God or away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In God's salvation the renewing of the heart is once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, in our experience our heart is renewed continually because it is changeable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps when you were saved, your heart turned to God in a very strong way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But after a period of time, your heart may turn away from Him somewhat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To a certain extent at least, your heart may turn away.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then by God's mercy your heart may turn fully to Him once again.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Through fellowship with a saint, through coming to the meetings, or by some other gracious means, your heart may turn to the Lord once again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When your heart was turned away from Him, it became somewhat corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when your heart came back to the Lord, it was renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to say, "Lord, I thank You that in Your mercy You have visited my heart and turned it back to You."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This turning to the Lord is the first characteristic of a renewed heart.</S>
