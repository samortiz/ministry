   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVE CHRIST TO BUILD UP THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Lord s recovery God s desire has been made more than clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen God s eternal purpose, His ultimate intention.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that God wants us to live Christ that the Body may be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although these are simple words, we all have to realize nothing is more crucial in the Bible than these two points.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I was young and seeking after the Lord, I was charged, taught, and helped to be overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was helped to overcome sin, the world, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was told how to be holy, and I was taught how to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to our experiences these are good, but these are not the crucial and central points in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The central points in the Bible are that we need to live Christ and that the Body needs to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you check your spiritual situation according to overcoming, according to holiness, or according to spirituality, you may be satisfied to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if you check your spiritual situation with the living of Christ and the building of the Body, you surely would not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Experientially speaking you may be somewhat overcoming and yet still not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may be somewhat holy and yet not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even you may be very spiritual and yet not live Christ very much.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, you may be all of these things and yet care nothing for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may not have one bit of the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within the past fifty years I have seen many spiritual people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have contacted nearly all of the spiritual giants during the past half century, either directly or by reading their writings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 1958 I was invited to a very spiritual place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After I had been there a while three of the five leading ones came to me to complain about the non-building situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may be overcoming, holy, and spiritual, and yet not have much experience in living Christ and in the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may overcome sin to a certain extent, yet you live Christ very little.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And as far as the building up of the Body, your experience is nil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we have seen the light in the recovery that God wants us to live Christ and to have the Body built up, I don t believe many among us would consider that they are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we test our spiritual situation according to this measurement we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is not much measure of the living of Christ and not much measure of the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now I would ask the two brothers on the platform to tell us why we do not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have been here for many years; we have the Life-studies of so many books of the Bible, yet we do not live Christ, and we are not that much builded up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to ask two brothers to open themselves to us and to consider what is the thing that hinders them, restricts them, and frustrates them from further experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What frustrates them from the further building up of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just in a few words I would say it is because I m so occupied with Satan, not in a sinful way, yet my whole being is constituted with an element other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And this causes me not to hunger and not to seek the light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a part of me like this and I stand with it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Too often I agree with it and allow it to have its way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I don t disagree and don t resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I passively allow it to have its way because I m spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I m waiting for God to do something about it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many times I recognize that there is no Christ and no building, but I don t resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is all I can say.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Okay, now it is your turn.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Lee, quite frankly I m glad you asked this question of me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This last week I ve been thinking a lot about this and even this morning I prayed about it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have been pray-reading through Matthew in my morning watch, and this morning I read verses in Matthew 6 concerning the giving of alms and praying in public.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I began to open to the Lord about this matter of peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I saw that I was occupied daily, even moment by moment, with something that is not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not sin and it is not the world, but it is peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I saw that the kingdom people should not do something simply to get recognition from other people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let me say this: both of your speakings are quite mixed up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The thing that frustrates both of you from living Christ and from being built up in the Body is not Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not a matter of desiring the recognition as mentioned in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You need to have your understanding rescued from all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To say Satan occupies you is a kind of deceiving excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I must tell you strongly that none of these things is the frustrating factor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The frustrating factor within you that keeps you from living Christ and from being built up in the Body is simply your peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Don t blame Satan that much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Satan didn t do that much.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Your peculiarity did everything.</S>
