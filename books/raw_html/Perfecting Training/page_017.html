 <h2 class="head1">PECULIARITY&mdash;THE EXPRESSION<br />
OF THE NATURAL LIFE</h2>
<p>We have previously pointed out that opinion is the embodiment of the self. But we have to realize this matter of peculiarity is much deeper than opinion. In principle our peculiarity is the expression of the natural self or the natural life. We may even say that peculiarity is the last or the final expression of the natural life. To be peculiar is not to be sinful or to be bad or to be evil. But it is to be biased; it is to be warped. Let me also diagnose our brother&rsquo;s problem. I don&rsquo;t believe humor or being humorous is his problem. According to his peculiarity, deep within him there is a factor. I would say that the factor within our brother may be that he always wants to be not common, but to be different from all others. This is the hidden factor that causes him to have the humorous, outward manifestation. Actually everyone&rsquo;s peculiarity is caused by a certain factor within. Just to deal with the brother&rsquo;s jokes or humor is simply to cut off some branches. The root within him is not the joking; the root within him is the desire to be different from others and not common. In principle we all have such a factor within us which causes us to be peculiar. You have to realize that to be peculiar is not wrong; it is not evil; it is not sinful; it is not bad. It is not hating people or damaging anything, but it is the ultimate expression of our natural being. This is the most hidden factor that frustrates all of us from experiencing Christ. I believe for many years this factor within our brother has been frustrating him very much from the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>I would encourage all of you to fellowship and to pray about these three things: culture, opinion, and peculiarity. Just to speak of our culture is too general, and opinion is also something on the surface. The subtle, hidden thing that most of us would not condemn is our peculiarity. I do believe that many of us have condemned our opinion again and again, but not many of us have condemned our peculiarity. If these three things could be thoroughly dealt with in the church life&mdash;culture, opinion, and peculiarity&mdash;I do believe Christ would have no frustration to be our enjoyment. These are the basic problems among us. We don&rsquo;t need to talk that much about worldliness, about sin, about evil things. But these things&mdash; culture, opinion, and peculiarity&mdash;are here frustrating us.</p>
