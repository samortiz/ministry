<p>During Paul&rsquo;s time the churches were brought into the purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation. But this wonderful condition was short-lived and was soon damaged (2 Tim. 1:15; 4:10, 16). By the time of Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom in about A.D. 67, the churches had declined and degraded. By a quarter of a century later Paul&rsquo;s vision was nearly lost. It was then that John began to do a mending work.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John, the Epistles of John, and Revelation were written by John around A.D. 90. The divine revelation was completed through the ministry of Paul, but it was spoiled by the degradation of the church. After a quarter of a century God used John to do a mending work. As a result, some aspects of the divine revelation became even stronger than they were previously. In Revelation John reveals that the Spirit is now the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit (1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6). John also reveals that the local churches are golden lampstands (1:12, 20). This revelation is an intensification. We must see that we are not only in Paul&rsquo;s completing vision but also in John&rsquo;s mending vision. John&rsquo;s vision not only corresponds to Paul&rsquo;s vision; it is even stronger than Paul&rsquo;s vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING DIVIDED OVER DOCTRINE AND<br />
THE MIXTURE OF POLITICS AND RELIGION</h2>
<p>After John died, beginning in the second century the divine revelation was nearly lost again because there were many doctrinal contentions concerning the person of Christ and the Divine Trinity. Some said that Christ is God, not man. Others said that Christ is man, not God. Still others said that Christ is neither fully God nor fully man. These teachings concerning the person of Christ are heresies that resulted in battles over the truth.</p>
<p>Apparently, the dispute concerning the person of Christ was a guarding of the truth, a protecting of the faith, and a contending for the truth. However, when Christians fell into doctrinal contentions and became divided, they no longer paid attention to the truth of life and the experience of life. They did not know the Body of Christ, nor did they see the revelation and light of the local churches.</p>
<p>In A.D. 306 Constantine became the emperor of Rome. In order to stop religious debates among Christians and to maintain peace and order in the Roman Empire, he gathered the great teachers of the Bible and held a council in Nicaea in A.D. 325. This council issued the Nicene Creed, which is still recited in the Roman Catholic Church and in Protestant denominations. Between A.D. 325 and A.D. 570, for about two hundred and fifty years, many councils were held, and numerous issues related to the truth were resolved.</p>
<p>Although Constantine the Great was considered the leader of Christianity, he also held the pagan title of Pontifex Maximus. He used silver, clothing, and many other material things to encourage thousands of unbelievers to be baptized, and he made Christianity the state religion. In this way he corrupted the church and brought many Gentile customs into the church. This was the outward condition of the church at that time. Some pious men, however, did not approve of these actions, and in order to guard the truth, they met secretly. However, the Lord&rsquo;s church on the earth was divided and corrupted.</p>
<p>Around A.D. 590 the papacy was formally established, and the pope&rsquo;s authority was confirmed and recognized. Hence, the Roman Church is also known as the Roman Catholic Church. The word <em>catholic</em> means &ldquo;universal.&rdquo; The Roman Catholic Church prohibited the laity from reading the Bible; only the clergy were allowed to read the Bible and only according to the pope&rsquo;s interpretations. Thus, the Bible was locked up until the Reformation in the early 1500s; the Bible was locked up for ten centuries. Historians call this period in the Middle Ages the Dark Ages because the truth and light in the Bible were locked up; hence, the whole world fell into spiritual darkness.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Great Mystery-Christ and the Church &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
