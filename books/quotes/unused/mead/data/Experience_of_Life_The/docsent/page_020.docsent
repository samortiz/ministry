   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LIMIT OF OUR DEALINGS WITH SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The limit of our dealing with sins is similar to that of our clearance of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we deal with sins, we should do it until we have life and peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we follow our consciousness in dealing with sins, we will feel inwardly satisfied, strengthened, refreshed, and quickened; we will also feel joyful, restful, comfortable, and secure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our spirit will be strong and living, and our fellowship with the Lord will be free and without hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our prayers will be releasing and with authority, and our utterance will be bold and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these senses and experiences are the conditions of life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the limit of our dealing with sins, and this also is the result of our dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we have said before about dealing with sins thoroughly implies that we deal with sins to such a state of life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>V. THE PRACTICE OF DEALING WITH SINS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have previously said that there are two aspects with regard to the object of dealing with sins: one is the record of sin before God, and the other is the actual deed of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we practice dealing with sins, therefore, these two aspects must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, the record of sin must be abolished; and, second, we must deal with the actual committing of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The abolishing of our record of sin before God is based upon the redeeming work of our Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our Lord bore for us the righteous judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His blood satisfied the requirement of God's law on our behalf; therefore, all our record of sin before God has been abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if this objective fact is to become our subjective experience, there is still the need of application.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We will speak of this application by dividing it into two stages: before we are saved and after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 10:43 says: "Every one that believeth on him shall receive remission of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are the words of the Apostle when preaching the gospel to the unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He told them that all the sins they committed before being saved would be forgiven if they would only believe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The abolishing of our record of sin before we are saved depends upon our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The application, therefore, is through our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First John 1:9 says that "if we confess our sins, he God forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These words were written by the Apostle to those who are saved, and they refer to all the sins we commit after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we become conscious of them in His light, we must confess them before God; then we will be forgiven and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The abolishing of our record of sin after we are saved, therefore, depends upon our confession.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here the application is through our confession.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not confess, God will not forgive or cleanse.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The moment we confess, we obtain forgiveness and cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we confess while still in this world, we obtain forgiveness while still here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not confess while here, we will still have to confess in the coming Kingdom before we can obtain forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This forgiveness is called the forgiveness in the Kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In conclusion, we obtain forgiveness for all the sins committed after we have been saved through our confession.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This confession is our dealing before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How should we deal with the actual committing of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we have offended God, we must deal with it before God and ask His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have sinned against man, we should deal with it before man by asking man's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If our act of sinning against man involves only a moral matter, we have only to confess this and apologize before man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If it also involves a loss of money and profits, then we should pay accordingly the amount we owe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This act of apologizing and reimbursing applies not only to sins committed after we are saved; we must also deal with all those sins committed before we were saved; we must deal with them one by one before man according to the inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This dealing with sins before man is the major part of this matter of dealing with sins, and we should take heed to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we deal with sins before man, there are four basic principles we should remember and by which we should abide.</S>
