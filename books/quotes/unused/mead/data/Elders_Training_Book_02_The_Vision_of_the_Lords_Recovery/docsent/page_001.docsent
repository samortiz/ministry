   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>FOREWORD</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During February of 1984 over three hundred and fifty brothers from six continents gathered in Anaheim, California with Brother Witness Lee for a two week international elders training.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The messages that were released at that time are the contents of this four volume set.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Book one presents the essential aspects of the ministry of the New Testament; book two sets forth the vision of the Lord s recovery; book three covers the way to carry out the vision; and book four emphasizes other crucial matters concerning the practice of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those of us that were in these meetings were deeply convicted of our need to be further enlightened by the Lord concerning God s economy and concerning the intrinsic essence of the New Testament ministry which is for the carrying out of this divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the Lord s recovery is continually spreading throughout the world, these messages are more than crucial and urgently needed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We believe that they will render a great help in preserving all the saints in the central lane of God s economy, without any deviation, for the fulfillment of His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our hope and expectation is that these messages will become a governing and controlling vision for all in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May we prayerfully consider all the points presented in these books and accept them without any preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>November, 1985</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Benson Phillips</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Irving, Texas</S>
