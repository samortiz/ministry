   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION THREE EXPERIENCE CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE TWO NATURES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A TALK WITH YOUNG BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A great number of people who have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior have discovered a new experience soon after they have believed: in their hearts it seems that there are two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two natures are incompatible with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of the two natures, one is evil and the other is good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes, when the good nature gains the upper hand, a person becomes very loving, patient, good, and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes, when the evil nature prevails, the person becomes very jealous, ill-tempered, wicked, and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those believers who are under this kind of condition experience sudden ups and downs in their life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes, their spiritual condition seems to be on the mountaintop; at other times, it seems to be in the deep valley.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of spiritual life is also like the waves of the sea, at times high and at times low.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Believers under this kind of condition are bewildered!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is there the joy?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is there the sorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why do we sometimes love a certain person that much and have the ability to tolerate so much of others ridicule?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why at other times are we so void of love and so impatient?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When such a person is at his spiritual peak, he experiences unspeakable joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he is spiritually low, he is filled with sorrow and depression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before such a person believed in the Lord, he did not have much feeling even when he sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But now it is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He may speak a wrong word or commit a wrong act by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Formerly, these things would have been considered trivial, and the conscience would not have been bothered at all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But now, he falls into much self-condemnation .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although no one condemns him, he rebukes himself for doing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such self-condemnation is quite unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It causes the believer to feel ashamed and embarrassed, to feel guilty and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only after he finds out that the Lord has fully forgiven his sins and he has recovered his spiritual joy can he feel happy again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, this kind of happiness does not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those believers who remain on this level of life soon find themselves caused to stumble again and their previous joy once more lost!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Soon after, they find themselves committing the same sin they committed before!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems so natural to fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is as if a power from within has overpowered them in an instant; they are led uncontrollably to speak the wrong words and do the wrong things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Under such a condition, the believers invariably become penitent.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They invariably make many vows and resolutions before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They set up for themselves many ordinances to bind themselves, in the hope that they will not commit the same error again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time, they ask for the cleansing of the Lord s blood afresh and seek for another filling of the Holy Spirit by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After this, they seem quite satisfied and think that their last sin is behind them, that from now on they are on their way to holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the fact always turns out contrary to their wish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Soon, perhaps a few days later, they fail again!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once more they fall into deep remorse, bemoaning their own failure and feeling sorrowful at heart; their hopes for holiness have been dashed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All their resolutions and regulations cannot help them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although they may receive the Lord s forgiveness after this, it becomes difficult for them to believe that they can keep themselves from sinning again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although they still pray that the Lord would keep them, their heart is full of doubts.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They begin to wonder if the Lord can really keep them from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Young believers frequently fall into this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Almost daily they come under self-condemnation and sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes they may condemn themselves several times a day or even several dozen times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such a life of wandering in the wilderness causes them to doubt even their own regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Does not the Scripture say, He cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God 1 John 3:9 ?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They think that if they always sin, it probably means that they are not yet regenerated!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The despondency and disappointment at such times are difficult to express even with their tears.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since these ones have experienced much failure, they make up their mind to be on the alert, to resolve to fight the last battle against the indwelling sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They remind themselves to watch out for their former weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They try purposely to improve themselves in areas where they constantly failed before.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They resolve as best they can to put off the sin which so easily entangles us Heb 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This of course affords them much help in their outward conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet the inward activities of sin continue as before; there is no quelling of its energy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the end, they fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Consider the example of the temper.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After a believer realizes that his besetting sin is his quick temper, he will try to control himself in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This may work with lesser irritations; it may work in one or two temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, though he may hold back his temper temporarily, further irritations from others will cause his temper to break loose.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He may succeed a few times, but as soon as he becomes a little careless, he loses his temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At the time of the temptation, he may experience much conflict in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, he thinks that he should not lose his temper and should be gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, he considers the unreasonableness and offense of the other party, and he feels it necessary to vindicate himself by punishing such behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This kind of conflict is found commonly among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Unfortunately, the result is often failure rather than victory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once they exhaust their patience, they fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A genuinely regenerated person often goes through this kind of experience at the beginning of his Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do not know how many tears are shed because of defeat in this conflict!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>My dear brothers, do you have the experiences we have mentioned?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do you want to know the reason for them?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do you want to overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May the Lord bless what we are discussing today so that we will learn to grow in His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before we speak of our present condition, we should first understand the kind of person we were before we believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After that, we will speak of our condition after we believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We know that we are persons made up of three parts the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The spirit is the organ with which we fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Animals have no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, they can never worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The soul is the seat of our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our will, mind, emotion, and sentiments are all functions of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The body is our outward shell.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Although man has become fallen, he still possesses these three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After man is regenerated, he still has the same three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When God created man, He created him with a self-consciousness; man was a living creature with consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He had a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hence, he was different from other lower kinds of creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He had a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, he was different from the angels of light, who are purely spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The center of man was his spirit; it controlled his whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It controlled his soul and his body.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Man was living totally for God; the emotions of his soul and the demands of his body were all headed up by his spirit, and they were for glorifying God and worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But alas, man fell!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This fall did not annul any of the three elements in man.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, the order of these three elements has been upset.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The condition in the garden of Eden shows us clearly that mankind rebelled against God; his love for God ceased, and he declared his independence from God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Genesis 3:6 says, And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food this was the lust of the body, which comes first and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired this was the love of the emotion in the soul, which comes next to make one wise this was Satan s suggestion, And ye shall be as gods, knowing 3:5 ; this was the spirit rejecting God, and man satisfying the cravings of the soul and the body; this comes last .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In this way, man fell, and his spirit, soul, and body were all affected.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The spirit became subject to the soul, and the soul was controlled by its many senses.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The body developed many abnormal cravings and lusts, which enticed the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Originally the spirit took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Now the body takes the lead to satisfy its lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In the Bible, this lust of the body is called the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>From this time on, man became flesh Gen 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This flesh is now man s nature after he sinned; it is now his natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Our nature is the life principle or constitution that directs our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Since the time of Adam, everyone born of woman bears this sinful nature; all of them are of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>After understanding the origin of the flesh and how the flesh is just our sinful nature, we can now consider the character of this flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We cannot expect this flesh to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Human nature is hard to change.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In fact, it will not change.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The Lord Jesus said, That which is born of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We should focus on the word is.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>No matter how much a person reforms, improves, and cultivates himself, the flesh is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>No matter how much a person tries to perform charitable, benevolent acts, send relief aid, love others, or serve, he is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Even if he can do all these things, he is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Since it is the flesh that is born, it will be the flesh that will result.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>No man on earth can change his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Neither can God in heaven change man s flesh, that is, man s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Since God saw that it was impossible to mend, improve, or change man s sinful nature, He brought in the present wonderful way of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We know that the Lord Jesus died for us on the cross at Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We also know that when we believe in Him and receive Him as our Savior, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>But why does God deliver us from death to life once we believe in His Son s name?</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If this believing does not involve an exchange in our life, which is different from a mere change , will not God be delivering a man who is still full of sin into heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>There must surely be a profound message here.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>After we have believed in the Lord Jesus, God does not leave us to walk according to the old sinful nature, that is, the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>He sentenced the Lord Jesus to death because He intended, on the one hand, that the Lord become sin for us, and on the other hand, that the old Adamic creation be crucified with Him, so that He could give us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior, God gave us this new life with its new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>At the time we believed, He dispensed into us His own life, the life of God, with the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>This nature is entirely new; it is totally different from our old sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This nature does not come from an improvement of our old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This mysterious transaction took place at the instant we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This is regeneration, which is to be born from above and to receive God s life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>This regeneration is not something that man feels.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Rather, it is the work of God s Holy Spirit in our spirit, recovering our spirit s lost position and installing God s life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>All those who have genuinely believed in the Lord Jesus have the Holy Spirit working in them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Those who believe only with their mouth or their head are not regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>All those who have believed with their heart are saved Rom 10:9 and are surely regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Now, two natures emerge in a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>One is the sinful nature, the flesh, which is the nature of old Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>The other is the spiritual life, the new spirit, which bears God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Brothers, you have believed in the Lord Jesus, and you know that you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>For this reason, you are regenerated already.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>You should now know that there are two natures within you.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>These two natures are the cause of your numerous conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>The reason you fluctuate up and down and alternate between victory and defeat is that two natures are exercising their influence over you.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>These two natures are the key to the riddle of your life of struggling.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>For a young believer to have such experiences of inward conflict and condemnation proves that he is regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>An unregenerated person is still dead in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Although he may at times be condemned in his conscience, such feeling is very ill-defined.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Without the new nature, it is obvious that a person will not experience the conflict between the new nature and the old.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>The Bible clearly describes this conflict between the new nature and the old.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>In Romans 7, Paul vividly portrayed this kind of life of conflict through his own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>He said, For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do v. 15 . This is the conflict of the new and the old natures.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>The description here is that of the experience of a newborn believer.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>At such times, he is still a babe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>He is in the infancy of his spiritual life, and he is still childish and powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>The I in the what I will and what I hate refers to the new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Although the new nature desires God s will and hates sin, the other nature, the old nature, is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>This, together with the weakness of a person s will, compels that one to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>However, the new nature does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Now then it is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me v. 17 . The first I is the I of the new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Sin is another name for the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>Therefore, this verse means that the one who sins is not the new I, but the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Of course, this does not remove man s responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Paul went on to describe the positive contradiction between the old and the new natures, that is, the contradiction between the sinful nature and the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice....I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members Rom 7:18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>This is indeed the common experience of all believers: to will to do good, yet be unable to do it, and to will to oppose evil, yet be unable to reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>When temptation comes, a power the law suppresses our desire for holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>As a result, we speak what we ought not speak and do what we ought not do.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>Despite many resolutions and vows, we are unable to stop this power from working.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>In Galatians Paul described again the conflict between these two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>The old nature and the new nature are enemies of each other.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>Both strive to gain absolute supremacy over us.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>The old nature has its desires and its power, and the new nature has its also.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>The two natures exist in us simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>Hence, there is the constant conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>They are like Esau and Jacob in the womb of Rebekah; the two were diametrically opposed to each other, and at times they fought with each other in the womb.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>When the Son of God was on earth, all the powers on earth plotted to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>In the same way, while the Son of God lives in our heart as our new life, all the lusts in our flesh strive to remove Him.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>Before we go on, we should first understand the characteristics of the two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>The old nature was born of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>In it, nothing good dwells Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>The new nature is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>It cannot sin 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>The new and the old natures are completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>Not only do they come from different sources; even their functions are different.</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>However, both exist in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='197' RSNT='1' SNO='197'>The old nature is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='198' RSNT='1' SNO='198'>And those who are in the flesh cannot please God Rom 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='199' RSNT='1' SNO='199'>The new nature is the new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='200' RSNT='1' SNO='200'>God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='201' RSNT='1' SNO='201'>Without comparison with the new nature, the old nature, humanly speaking, is not too bad, despite some self-excusing inclinations and lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='202' RSNT='1' SNO='202'>Yet, when a person is regenerated, the new nature comes in with the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='203' RSNT='1' SNO='203'>When both the new and the old natures are put side by side, the true characteristics of the old nature are exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='204' RSNT='1' SNO='204'>With the new nature as a contrast, the old nature is exposed to be evil, worldly, and devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='205' RSNT='1' SNO='205'>The new nature is holy, heavenly, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='206' RSNT='1' SNO='206'>Because the old nature, with the passing of time, has become so deeply intertwined with the person himself, it takes quite a period of time to remove this old nature in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='207' RSNT='1' SNO='207'>The new nature has just come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='208' RSNT='1' SNO='208'>Since man s flesh and sinful nature have become too strong, the growth and function of the new nature are suppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='209' RSNT='1' SNO='209'>Of course, we are only speaking from man s point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='210' RSNT='1' SNO='210'>This is like the thorns choking the growth of the seed of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='211' RSNT='1' SNO='211'>Because the two natures are opposite one to another, when temptation comes, a person experiences fierce conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='212' RSNT='1' SNO='212'>Since the old nature is strong and the new nature weak, a person often ends up doing what he does not desire to do and not doing what he does desire to do.</S>
   <S PAR='213' RSNT='1' SNO='213'>Since the new nature is holy, when a person fails, he feels repentant and condemns himself, and he pleads for the sin-cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='214' RSNT='1' SNO='214'>Brothers, by now, you should understand the reason for your conflicting experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='215' RSNT='1' SNO='215'>This kind of conflict shows most assuredly that you are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='216' RSNT='1' SNO='216'>The most crucial question now is: how can we overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='217' RSNT='1' SNO='217'>In other words, how can we reject the power and work of the old nature, and walk according to the aspirations of the new nature, and thus please the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='218' RSNT='1' SNO='218'>Let us read three verses:</S>
   <S PAR='219' RSNT='1' SNO='219'>But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='220' RSNT='1' SNO='220'>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit ; But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh vv.</S>
   <S PAR='221' RSNT='1' SNO='221'>25, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='222' RSNT='1' SNO='222'>These three verses tell us two ways to overcome the flesh, that is, the sinful nature, the old nature, and the old Adamic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='223' RSNT='1' SNO='223'>Actually, the two ways are merely two aspects, or two phases, of one way.</S>
   <S PAR='224' RSNT='1' SNO='224'>The cross and the Holy Spirit are the unique way to overcome the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='225' RSNT='1' SNO='225'>Other than this way, any human resolutions, determinations, or vows to charity are destined for failure.</S>
   <S PAR='226' RSNT='1' SNO='226'>We have seen that all our failures are caused by the tenaciousness of the sinful nature; we sink to such a low condition because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='227' RSNT='1' SNO='227'>Hence, whether or not we will overcome depends on whether or not we are able to deal with this sinful nature, which is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='228' RSNT='1' SNO='228'>Thank God that though we are helpless, He has the way.</S>
   <S PAR='229' RSNT='1' SNO='229'>He has prepared a way for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='230' RSNT='1' SNO='230'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for us, but He crucified our flesh with Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='231' RSNT='1' SNO='231'>Hence, all those who belong to Christ Jesus and are regenerated have their flesh crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='232' RSNT='1' SNO='232'>When He died on the cross, our flesh was crucified there as well.</S>
   <S PAR='233' RSNT='1' SNO='233'>Both the substitutional death and the identifying death have been accomplished by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='234' RSNT='1' SNO='234'>Both are fully accomplished .</S>
   <S PAR='235' RSNT='1' SNO='235'>Formerly, we believed in His substitutional death and were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='236' RSNT='1' SNO='236'>Now, in the same way, we believe that our flesh is crucified with Him, and we are brought into the experience of the death of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='237' RSNT='1' SNO='237'>We know that the flesh is always the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='238' RSNT='1' SNO='238'>This is why God gave us a new life and a new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='239' RSNT='1' SNO='239'>But what shall we do with the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='240' RSNT='1' SNO='240'>Since God considered it hopeless and impossible, He decided to terminate it, that is, to put it to death.</S>
   <S PAR='241' RSNT='1' SNO='241'>There is no better way than to cause the flesh to die.</S>
   <S PAR='242' RSNT='1' SNO='242'>Hence, they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='243' RSNT='1' SNO='243'>This puts the flesh to death.</S>
   <S PAR='244' RSNT='1' SNO='244'>This is what the Lord Jesus has accomplished; He has accomplished it already.</S>
   <S PAR='245' RSNT='1' SNO='245'>By crucifying our flesh with Him, it becomes possible now for us to put to death the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='246' RSNT='1' SNO='246'>This has been accomplished without any effort of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='247' RSNT='1' SNO='247'>How can this co-crucifixion become our experience?</S>
   <S PAR='248' RSNT='1' SNO='248'>We have said that the way is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='249' RSNT='1' SNO='249'>Romans 6:11 says, So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='250' RSNT='1' SNO='250'>Sin here refers to the sinful nature which is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='251' RSNT='1' SNO='251'>By ourselves, we cannot cause the flesh to die.</S>
   <S PAR='252' RSNT='1' SNO='252'>The only way is by reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='253' RSNT='1' SNO='253'>Reckoning is an exercise of our will and our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='254' RSNT='1' SNO='254'>This means that in our daily life, we should adopt the attitude that we are dead to the flesh, that we believe in God s word, and that we consider all God s words to be true.</S>
   <S PAR='255' RSNT='1' SNO='255'>God says that our flesh has been crucified with the Lord Jesus; I believe that my flesh is indeed crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='256' RSNT='1' SNO='256'>On the one hand, we believe that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='257' RSNT='1' SNO='257'>On the other hand, we adopt the attitude that we are truly dead.</S>
   <S PAR='258' RSNT='1' SNO='258'>If we do this, we will have the genuine experience of dying to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='259' RSNT='1' SNO='259'>If we reckon this way, we will see the cross freeing us, and the flesh will become powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='260' RSNT='1' SNO='260'>It is true that once we reckon ourselves dead, we will experience instant victory.</S>
   <S PAR='261' RSNT='1' SNO='261'>However, many people experience a gradual deliverance from the power of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='262' RSNT='1' SNO='262'>This is either due to their own foolishness or to the lingering of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='263' RSNT='1' SNO='263'>If we persist in faith and if we take the proper attitude in our will, we will eventually overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='264' RSNT='1' SNO='264'>However, this does not mean that henceforth there is no more sinful nature in us and that only the new nature remains.</S>
   <S PAR='265' RSNT='1' SNO='265'>If we say this, we fall into heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='266' RSNT='1' SNO='266'>Not only does this obscure the teaching of the Bible, but it betrays the experience of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='267' RSNT='1' SNO='267'>Until we are delivered from this body of sin, we will never be free from the flesh the sinful nature which comes from the body of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='268' RSNT='1' SNO='268'>Even though we have accepted the work of the cross, the fact that the flesh still exists means that we must continually walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='269' RSNT='1' SNO='269'>Only by doing this, will we by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='270' RSNT='1' SNO='270'>The cross is the instrument by which we crucify the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='271' RSNT='1' SNO='271'>The Holy Spirit is the power by which we keep the flesh from resurrecting.</S>
   <S PAR='272' RSNT='1' SNO='272'>On the negative side, we should believe in the co-crucifixion of the cross for the elimination of a life in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='273' RSNT='1' SNO='273'>On the positive side, we should walk according to the Spirit so that the flesh will have no chance to be rekindled.</S>
   <S PAR='274' RSNT='1' SNO='274'>Many believers experience the resurrection of their flesh because they fail in this one point.</S>
   <S PAR='275' RSNT='1' SNO='275'>Every time we walk contrary to the Holy Spirit, we give opportunity to the flesh to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='276' RSNT='1' SNO='276'>If in everything we walk according to the Spirit, the flesh will not have any opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='277' RSNT='1' SNO='277'>A person can read about this way of overcoming the flesh, the sinful nature, from the Bible; he can hear about it from others.</S>
   <S PAR='278' RSNT='1' SNO='278'>But only when he encounters it in his experience will he realize that it is real.</S>
   <S PAR='279' RSNT='1' SNO='279'>I often tell others that they can experience such a matter the minute they believe.</S>
   <S PAR='280' RSNT='1' SNO='280'>Yet for myself, it took me a long time before I experienced it!</S>
   <S PAR='281' RSNT='1' SNO='281'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='282' RSNT='1' SNO='282'>Many times we merely strive.</S>
   <S PAR='283' RSNT='1' SNO='283'>Although we say that we trust in the cross, thirty percent of the time we trust in ourselves and in our own reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='284' RSNT='1' SNO='284'>Many times God allows us to be defeated so that in the end we would realize that nothing is trustworthy in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='285' RSNT='1' SNO='285'>Even our own reckoning with which we reckon ourselves dead is of no merit.</S>
   <S PAR='286' RSNT='1' SNO='286'>This is why it is true to say that as soon as we truly reckon, we have the experience of victory, and it is equally true to say that we enter such experience only through a gradual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='287' RSNT='1' SNO='287'>Brothers, by now you can understand our two natures and the way to overcome the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='288' RSNT='1' SNO='288'>While you are reading, you can exercise your faith to reckon yourself dead to sin, and you can pray that the Holy Spirit of the Lord will apply the cross of the Lord Jesus deeply in you, so that you can overcome sin in your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='289' RSNT='1' SNO='289'>After this, you should resolve to walk by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='290' RSNT='1' SNO='290'>Previously, you have failed in your resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='291' RSNT='1' SNO='291'>Now, you should ask the Holy Spirit to strengthen your will, so that it will be able to incline itself to the new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='292' RSNT='1' SNO='292'>The will is like a rudder; it can turn the whole ship.</S>
   <S PAR='293' RSNT='1' SNO='293'>However, a rudder that does not work is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='294' RSNT='1' SNO='294'>After the Holy Spirit has strengthened you, you should exercise this will to walk according to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='295' RSNT='1' SNO='295'>Remember that the flesh never disappears; it is always there.</S>
   <S PAR='296' RSNT='1' SNO='296'>If you walk by the Holy Spirit, you will be able to crucify the flesh on the cross continually.</S>
   <S PAR='297' RSNT='1' SNO='297'>Otherwise, the flesh will cause suffering to you.</S>
   <S PAR='298' RSNT='1' SNO='298'>The meaning of walking by the Spirit is to trust in the Holy Spirit in a calm way in everything, so that you will bear the nine-in-one fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='299' RSNT='1' SNO='299'>The Lord will lead you experientially step by step into the mystery of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='300' RSNT='1' SNO='300'>However, on your part, you should be faithful.</S>
