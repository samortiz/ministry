   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>He not only was one who "trusted in themselves that they were righteous" but also "exalt ed himself" v.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>14 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Self- exalting ones go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a preacher, I have never seen a proud person become saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man wants to be saved, he must admit that he is a helpless and hopeless sinner, unable to save himself and unable to trust himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He must admit that he deserves hell.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He needs to prostrate himself before the cross to beg for grace and believe in Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified in a shameful way to be his vicarious Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How humbling this is!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without humbling ourselves, who can do this?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is nothing under heaven more humbling than to believe in the Lord Jesus as the Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Worldly people are very unwilling to confess that they cannot do good!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Self-exalting ones are not willing to come to the despised cross to seek grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A self-exalting man cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He likes to say that he can do good and can patch up all his wrong doings with his own good works.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if he cannot, he will try to bear his own responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is hard for him to confess that he is a sinner and that Jesus Christ is his Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Oh, proud one, please do not be so proud anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Humble yourself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, your pride will cause you to go to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, the Pharisee did not ask God for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He thought that a person as qualified as he was did not need to ask God for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a righteous man like the Pharisee is sufficiently qualified to be saved, why ask God for grace?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since he already has done good works, why is there a need for him to lose face by asking for grace?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although he went up to the temple to pray, the Lord said that he "prayed these things to himself."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please read verses 11 and 12 again and see whether or not he prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not come to the temple of God saying, "God, I have this and that shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please fill me."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He did not say, "God, I cannot save myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please save me."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, he said, "God, I thank You, because I can be good without Your help.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I never did this or that evil thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, I have done many good things."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not pray!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did not beseech God!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He thought that he was the top person and that he was good to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did not come to pray; he came to give a report!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He came before God just to give Him a report and to let Him know all his merits.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He seemed to be saying, "God, I thank You, I did not do many sinful things; instead, I did many good things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am afraid that You do not know about it, so I came to give You a report."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not ask God for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was truly a good man, according to his own estimate and others' evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But he was an outsider to God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He had never seen God; he did not know God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So he dared to boast before the God of all holiness and all goodness!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the eyes of his heart had not been completely blinded, he would not have been so foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though he and all the others thought he was a good person, in God's eyes he was still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was not justified, and he needed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If he would not be saved, he would perish and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way that a great sinner needs a Savior to redeem him and suffer the penalty of sin for him, this so-called righteous person needs the same in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But he was blind to this need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He never knew God or God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, he did not know that he was also a sinner before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He also needed a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was too self-content and too proud!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He thought that he was capable and able!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When he arrived in hell, he surely was shocked and thought he had gone to the wrong place!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Little did he realize that this very place was his real home!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Pharisee had already perished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to take this case as a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He made two great mistakes regarding salvation: 1 he thought that in order to be saved he should do good, and 2 since he was good, he was surely saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He did not know that these thoughts were absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we read Ephesians 2:8-9, we can see that we are not saved by our good works but by believing in the grace of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already" John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether a person will be saved or will perish depends on whether or not he believes and receives the salvation that has been accomplished by the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It does not depend on our own goodness or badness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since we are not saved by doing good, someone who is just good cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Dear readers, do not think that you can be saved by accumulating good works little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I know and God knows that you are unable to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even if you are able, the God of all goodness does not consider your goodness as good.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Good works can never save you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You cannot buy God's salvation by doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You should first be saved, then do good works.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not change the order, thinking that first you should do good works, and then you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Please come now and receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now we are going to see the wicked person who was saved, and find out how wicked he was and why he could go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was a tax collector Luke 18:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>According to the situation in Jewish society at the time, a tax collector was the most despised among all classes of people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Chinese consider a robber to be the worst man and a harlot to be the worst woman.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have a saying, "a man-robber and a woman-harlot."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For the Jews, the lowest, most ignoble, wicked, and dirty profession for a man was to be a tax collector!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For a male to be a tax collector and a female to be a harlot is the most despicable thing!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But the Lord Jesus said that even though he was despised by men, he was justified by God; he was saved and could go to heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In those days the Jews were under the dictatorship of the Roman government, and the Romans taxed the Jews by the system of collecting tribute money.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The government would set the amount of tax in a certain place and then hire people to collect it.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>These tax collectors collected tribute for the Roman government.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When they took the job of collecting tribute, they would extort a tribute of their own choosing, so that the excess tax would be theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As a group, they helped evildoers do evil and cared for even the smallest, trifling amounts.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They only cared for their own gain; therefore, they were considered by society as the most low and despised of men.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This was the tax collector in the eyes of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If you asked a Jew which kind of person was the worst, he would certainly answer, "a tax collector."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But the Lord Jesus said that the tax collector would go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Wicked men can go to heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the sinful and wicked, such as this tax collector, can be saved, what is possible for those who are less sinful!</S>
