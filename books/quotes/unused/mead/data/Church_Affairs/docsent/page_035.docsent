   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Going to the Other Extreme</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, today we cannot go to the other extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people do so, thinking that there is absolutely no method in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I want you to pay attention to this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are people who study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You need to see that there are definitely methods in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just look at the arrangement at the time of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You will see that there was definitely a method to carry out affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Frankly speaking, even if you had only one or two thousand people, you would be unable to deal with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you were like the apostles with over ten thousand people, there would be total confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We see that the record of the Bible, however, only touches the matter lightly and then goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are not too many words, but just one phrase: Distributed to each, as anyone had need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Behind these few words, however, much work was done.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, I want you brothers to be able to see that during the time of the apostles there were methods for doing things in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But God did not want to leave these methods for later generations to imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God s Spirit is working in a certain place, a method for doing things will naturally come out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Lord blesses greatly on a certain occasion, a method will come out spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the spiritual blessing dies out, the method for doing things will die out with it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have no desire that the days of the methods for doing things would be even one day longer than the days of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We hope, brothers, that you will find a way between these two extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are groups of people, such as the Protestants, who always pay attention to the method.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please remember that the less water a glass has, the more people examine the exterior of the glass.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the glass is no longer used to hold water, it is hung up on the wall as an antique.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>People always pay attention to external things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that God does not allow such things to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, it is not that there are no methods.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Chapter six of Acts shows us very clearly that since the problem of a few widows of the Hellenists was not solved, the apostles felt that this matter was not taken care of properly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There were only a few widows who had an unresolved problem among more than ten thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet the apostles were not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Remember the words that Paul spoke to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It seems that Timothy recorded the names of the widows in a record book.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in the Bible you cannot find out what a widow s book is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was mentioned in a casual way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seems that Timothy was very familiar with this record book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul did not say to set up a record book of a certain size, nor did he say how to fill it in. He did not say any of this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He only spoke of enrolling the widows.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that at that time everyone knew about this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later, he simply said not to enroll anyone in a careless way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A problem was discovered only those sixty years old and above should be enrolled and the matter was thus settled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not say where this record book came from or where it should go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Prayer Being Needed</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>concerning How to Carry Things Out</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not know whether you know this way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Bible there are arrangements and there is a record book, but the Bible does not emphasize the details related to this record book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God does not want to spend the effort to speak even two more sentences about it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is there is sufficient for us when we need to carry out some affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a principle that there is the need for a record book.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The principle of a record book is here, but as to the way of setting up this record book, you and I need to pray: Lord, we know that in the early church there was a record book, but we do not know how to set it up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, teach us how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We know that there are arrangements in the church on the one hand, and we need to endeavor before God to find the way on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is not willing to lay out before us in the Bible a detailed form of a record book that we can conveniently use to know how to do the work so that we do not need to pray at all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please remember that God is not willing to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers, I want you to see this before God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not pay attention to the method for doing things, because that is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once you pay attention to the method, you will make things dull and deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The methods will be set up in such a strong way that one day, when the spiritual blessing is lost, the empty frame of a corpse will still remain.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Neither do I want the brothers and sisters to be careless, not expending even a little effort to find out how to take care of affairs, nor ever considering a way to do things in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Bible does not tell us how to work, but there is a principle in doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today we need to seek out that way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not that God does not have a way; God does have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let us be careful never to be so spiritual that we do not have any methods at all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There was still a method there Distributed to each, as anyone had need.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We still need to carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>THE METHODS THAT WE SEE TODAY The Need for a Service Office</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If there were only seven or eight believers in a local church or if there were only two or three gathered into the name of the Lord, we would not need a business office.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If there are a good number of saints in a locality, one hundred, several hundred, or more than a thousand, it would be difficult and confusing without a business office.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the first problem.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today we want to see something regarding the methods the apostles used to do things in their time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Principle of the Record Book</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>From my point of view, the second thing that I want to specifically point out is the principle of the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the principle of the widows being enrolled in the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If the record book were a method instead of a principle, then God would have told us the length and the thickness of it and its format.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But God described the record book in a very brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, you are able to know that there is a principle of the record book.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If anything in God s Word is described with only one phrase without any details, then you know that that matter is a principle in the Bible and is, therefore, not in detail.</S>
