   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>8 Some people may have doubt about our practice of receiving others, a practice which is based only upon whether they are Christians and which leaves the responsibility of attending the bread-breaking meeting to them.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may fear this is not safe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, we should realize that the fellowship among Christians is too spiritual a matter, with which no human hand should interfere nor defend.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, if we are spiritual rather than being in the mind, we will see the lordship of the Holy Spirit in His power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, if our acquaintance with the Holy Spirit is but a knowledge of the mind rather than of our experience, confusion is the sure consequence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Have we not acted in the meeting according to the direction and guidance of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have given Him the unlimited place of exercising His headship to choose and use His vessel rather than accommodating an arrangement of man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, why not trust the Holy Spirit to keep the purity of the fellowship in the bread-breaking meeting, and why not trust Him to urge the saints to come or to hinder the saints from coming to this meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we really give ground to Him to exercise His lordship, there is no need to replace it with a closed form of receiving that is of human invention.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We also considered the question regarding the distribution of God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some, seeing the vast land of China, are tempted to attain the position of director over all of God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How good this seems from a human point of view, because workers would then be distributed evenly, no one area having either too many or too few.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We would say, however, that regardless of how man seeks after God's will, the Holy Spirit is always the unique Executor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He never needs man to be His manager.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to exercise such faith in the lordship of the Holy Spirit that we will never form an economic center for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man delights to divide money equally with all of God's servants so that no one will gain too much or too little.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if we do this, where is the lordship of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the past ten years we have endeavored to the best of our ability to give the Holy Spirit the complete lordship in this matter, letting Him direct the saints themselves or the local meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The result has been: "He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must allow the Holy Spirit to exercise His lordship in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No matter how we have sought after His mind, we are never His assistants.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must allow the Holy Spirit to do everything according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must also be clear whether the Holy Spirit is now exercising His authority or if we have set ourselves up as a guard over the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>9 The reason for the lack of life in the present meetings is that man's hands have been substituted for the lordship of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the beginning, during the past century, it was not so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to what we have heard and read about the meetings a century ago, they were filled with life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time there was not the matter of receiving others for fellowship as we know it today; the Holy Spirit was the only leader in the work and in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was only after man's failure the Bethesda incident , that man's hands began to take control of the matter of receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Church history reveals to us that each denomination started in revival.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At such times the Holy Spirit began His work through His own chosen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the first period of such a work, the Holy Spirit was honored and held all the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The blessing flowed out like rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in order to keep the blessing and maintain the truth, men invented many rules, systems, and an organization rather than pursuing the ruling of the Holy Spirit in each believer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consequently, after a certain period, the work of the Holy Spirit was stopped, but the system, the regulations, and the organizations remained, and these gravitated towards more strictness as time went by.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>10 Now we must make our position clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not stand in such an open position that will tolerate any matter that would bring shame to our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No, absolutely not!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Neither do we stand in such a closed position that we close our fellowship according to the human will rather than the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What we stand upon is a spiritually closed fellowship, which means that all of our fellowship must be completely in the Holy Spirit without the slightest mixture of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to enjoy this kind of fellowship, the flesh must be thoroughly dealt with by the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The flesh has no share in this kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not enough to refuse the "evil companion"; the whole life of the flesh must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The power of the cross must be experienced through the Holy Spirit in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The knowledge of this in our mind is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This alone is our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, we are as open as the first churches in receiving all Christians, and we are as closed as the Holy Spirit in rejecting everything that is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many people whom you presume to be in your fellowship, but in reality they are really not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The numbers of these people may be far beyond our expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How sad this is!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many believers who have been received under strict examination are not living in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They think they are in fellowship and are qualified to break bread because they do not have any obvious sin!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do we not agree that this standard of fellowship too low?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The danger of man's choice often is that those who should not be in fellowship have been received, while those who should be in fellowship have been rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Has not this situation arisen many times among us?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if we would leave the choosing entirely to the Holy Spirit and be willing to stand aside and fully trust in Him, this difficulty would not arise.</S>
