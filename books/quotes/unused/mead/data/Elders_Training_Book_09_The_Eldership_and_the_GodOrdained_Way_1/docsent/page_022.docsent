   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The very crucial part in God's government was God's instant speaking through the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among the people of Israel, there were the elders on the one hand and the priests on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the Scripture does not clearly indicate how the elders were produced, it does tell us how the priests were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God chose the entire nation of Israel to be a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He intended for every male Israelite to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the children of Israel fell and failed to arrive at God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, God turned His choosing of the entire nation of Israel as priests to a family, the house of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The house of Aaron became a house of priests to replace the nation of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Aaron as the father was appointed by God to be the high priest and all his sons became the priests Exo 28:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the way the priests were produced in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among the priests was the high priest with his priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The most important part of these garments was the breastplate on the ephod Exo 28:15-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the breastplate were twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>17-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I read an article years ago concerning the Urim and the Thummim written by a Hebrew scholar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to this article, the twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel were composed of eighteen of the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The remaining four letters were put on a piece called the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word Thummim indicates perfection or completion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, on the breastplate with the additional piece called the Thummim, all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, according to this article, the Urim, which means light, was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Normally the twelve stones of the breastplate were under the shining of the Urim.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the priest went into God's presence with the breastplate, suddenly a stone inscribed with a certain name became dark.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This darkening of a particular stone was God's instant speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was in this way that letter by letter, the high priest was able to spell out a word, then a sentence, then a paragraph, until the full judgment of God was determined.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was necessary to have the complete Hebrew alphabet of twenty-two letters so that any word could be made.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The writer of this article said that it was through the Urim and the Thummim that the sin of Achan was discovered in Joshua 7.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the Urim and the Thummim, they knew that the one who sinned belonged to the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually the family and the person were found out vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The breastplate of the high priest is called the breastplate of judgment in Exodus 28:30 because it speaks for God instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever there was a problem that could not be decided or resolved by the written law, the high priest brought the breastplate into the presence of God to wait on God and to read the letters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then he received the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the way to receive God's instant revelation concerning His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, this is why some scholars have called this divine administration in the Old Testament a theocracy.</S>
