   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us summarize what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The future of Christians is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For a saved Christian the question of the new heaven and new earth, including all eternity, is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the age of the kingdom is controversial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one dares to say anything about what will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we have to solve today is the problem of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the kingdom there are many ranks of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many will reign with Christ because they have worked faithfully and have undergone persecution, reproach, and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may not have undergone persecution, reproach, and suffering, but they do not have sins either.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They have lived a clean life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although they have done nothing that deserves special merit, they have at least given a cup of water to a little one for the sake of the Lord's name Matt 10:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will also receive a reward, but their reward will be very small.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the age of the kingdom, some Christians will receive a reward in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some will receive a great reward; others will receive a small reward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who will not receive a reward are also divided into a few categories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One group will not enter into the kingdom at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible does not tell us where they will go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It only says that they will be kept outside the kingdom in the outer darkness Matt 8:12; 22:13; 25:30; Luke 13:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They will be left outside the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, there will be many who, in addition to not having worked well, have specific sins not yet dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are saved, but when they die, they still have sins which they have not repented of and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They still have the problem of sin with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These ones will be temporarily put into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will come out only after they have paid all their debts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This will last at most until the end of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not know how long this period will actually be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are still many things which we are not clear about concerning the future, but the Bible has shown us enough.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although there are details which we have not yet seen, we do know what the children of God will face.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some will receive a reward; some will go into corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some will be put into prison, and still some will be cast into the fire and be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The matter of our salvation is quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a man trusts in the Lord Jesus, both salvation and eternal life are settled for him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after a person is saved and up until he dies, his works, that is, his failures or his victories, will determine his fate in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our God is a just God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, our salvation is free, and those who believe will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can overturn this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, we cannot sin at will just because we have received eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we bring forth thorns and thistles, we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the Lord Jesus cannot disassociate us from our sins and if we have not settled everything in our lives, God has no choice but to chastise us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has no choice but to cleanse us with specific punishments, so that we can be together with Him in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is a just God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What He has prepared is also just.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once we have seen these things, we must learn the lesson and take the warnings from God.</S>
