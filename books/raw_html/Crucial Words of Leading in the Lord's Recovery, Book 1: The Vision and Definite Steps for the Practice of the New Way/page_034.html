<h2 class="head1">SOME SPECIFIC PRACTICES IN CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Focusing on the Fa&#231;ade</h2>
<p>Now we will fellowship further on how to seriously carry out the change of system. The way of religion is to have a Sunday service that is mainly a fa&#231;ade, but our way is to have all the saints functioning organically. Once there is a fa&#231;ade, the organic function of the believers is put aside, and the believers are killed. We must drop the concept of putting on a show. We do not care for the fa&#231;ade; we care only for the fulfilling of our organic function. In the spiritual service, any kind of fa&#231;ade kills people. This is true even in our daily life. A normal living should be without any fa&#231;ade. For example, in a family the husband wipes the windows, the wife cooks the three meals, the daughters wash the dishes, one of the sons sweeps the floor and dusts the furniture, another one cleans the restroom, and the youngest one mops the floor. Is there any fa&#231;ade? No, rather, every one of them is functioning. It is when they invite guests that a fa&#231;ade is put on for people to see. Once they have a fa&#231;ade, no one has to do anything, nor can anyone do anything. Therefore, no family can put on a fa&#231;ade every day. If a family puts on a fa&#231;ade every day, it would no longer be a family but a restaurant, and all the members would be &ldquo;choked to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today our changing the system is to remove the fa&#231;ade and recover the true condition of our daily life. I implore the co-workers and elders to have a change in concept. We should never think that our meeting hall is so big that there is therefore the need for a fa&#231;ade. If an elder in hall one puts on a fa&#231;ade, hall one will be killed. Therefore, never put on a fa&#231;ade.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we ignore the need of the actual situation. We truly understand the ideas of the people in our society. The majority of people who want to join Christianity desire to attend Sunday services and hear good sermons. This is the reason that I stress that we need to have a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day where a proper message can be given. Besides this, we need to have a &ldquo;home life,&rdquo; which is our small group meeting, with no fa&#231;ade. Hence, do not be bothered by the &ldquo;dragging&rdquo; situation in the small group; rather, welcome it, because it shows that we care for all the members.</p>
<p>Whether or not we can have a successful small group hinges on the co-workers and elders. If we are not willing to labor on this matter, the small groups will eventually be &ldquo;dragged&rdquo; into Hades and will become nothing. Hence, I beseech the elders and co-workers to labor diligently. We must have the determination to labor on this and to be persistent to the end. In this way, the &ldquo;dragging&rdquo; of the small group will be the &ldquo;singing of the songs of ascents&rdquo;; the more it is &ldquo;dragged,&rdquo; the higher it goes.</p>
<p>At present there are four hundred small groups in Taipei. If every small group can bring in a new one each week, we will bring in 1,600 in a month, and almost 20,000 in a year. This could never be achieved through the big meetings. Moreover, the new ones are not strangers invited off the street; rather, they are all related to the members of the small groups. Because they are their friends, relatives, and neighbors, it is more likely that they will remain. Furthermore, since all the members function organically, they spontaneously will have a love for the new ones. For example, a sister may not know how to love and take care of children when she is single, but after she is married and has children, she spontaneously loves and takes care of her children.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a small group the conversation is more intimate. The small group lends itself to the mutual shepherding and caring. No one puts on a fa&#231;ade. The small group has so many advantages. There is no fa&#231;ade but much supply. Without a fa&#231;ade and without rituals, religion is knocked down and the functions of the members are manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Elders Taking the Lead<br />
to Promote the Small Groups</h2>
<p>The elders must promote the small groups in every meeting hall. Ask the saints to set a time and place to have small group meetings and to let their friends, relatives, and neighbors know about the meetings. The meeting time should be flexible. It can be from 7:00 P.M. to midnight. Everyone needs to be in a meeting once a week. We want the saints to function organically to take care of people and shepherd them. Even if some people work late and come home at 10:00 or 11:00 P.M., they should still be able to come to eat, drink tea, and meet. Some may have something to do late at night, but they should still be able to meet with the group and then go and take care of their business. We do not even need to be so legal in the matter of having snacks. We do not need to begin with singing hymns and reading the Bible, and then serve snacks after the meeting is over. It does not need to be this way. We must simply make sure that every week we have a small group meeting. Even though this kind of meeting requires more work, it helps all the members to develop their organic function, to take care of one another, and to incite one another to love.</p>
<p>There is no fa&#231;ade in the group meeting, and there is no opportunity for people to show off. Instead, there are many advantages. This is the life pulse in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The best way to gain people for the Lord is to open all of our homes to contact, nourish, and cherish people. Do not rely on the way of holding big gospel meetings. That way does not work. Once we have a podium, there is the appearance of a law court, the putting on of a fa&#231;ade; this is religion, and it kills people. We do not trust in the big gospel campaigns but in the homes of the brothers and sisters.</p>
