<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>ROMANS</h1><p>For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled. (Rom. 5:10)<p>In this verse of the Scriptures two matters are mentioned: the first matter is the death of God’s Son, and the second is His life. This verse tells us that while we were enemies of God, we were reconciled to God through the death of the Lord Jesus and the problems between us and God were solved. Moreover, since we have been reconciled, we will be saved in the life of the Lord Jesus. Being reconciled to God through the Lord’s death is one thing and being saved in the Lord’s life is another thing. Here, our being saved refers not only to our being saved by believing in the Lord, but even more to our being saved by the Lord step by step, after we believe in Him, from the old creation and the self into His glory. On the negative side, we were saved through the Lord’s death to be reconciled to God, thereby solving the problems between us and God. On the positive side, we are being saved in the Lord’s life from the old creation and the natural being to enter fully into the glory of God.<p>And not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation. (v. 11)<p>In this verse whom refers to the One who is in resurrection. The Greek word for boasting means “to boast” and also “to exult.” This is to say that since we were reconciled to God through the Lord’s death, we now have God as our boast, our exultation, our rejoicing, and our enjoyment in the Lord’s resurrection through His life.<p>For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. (8:2)<p>That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit. For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace. (vv. 4-6)<p>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you. (vv. 9-11)<p>For you have not received a spirit of slavery bringing you into fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father! The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. (vv. 15-16)<p>And not only so, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body. (v. 23)<p>Moreover, in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness, for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. But He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers; and those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified. (vv. 26-30)<p>Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord. (1:3-4)<p>I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. (12:1)<p>For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. (14:17)<p>Holy here is an emphasized word. In Greek Holy comes after the Spirit, meaning that the Spirit is the “Holy”; hence, the Holy Spirit.
