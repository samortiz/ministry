         <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CENTRAL VISION OF THE BIBLE&mdash;<br />
BUILDING THE HOUSE OF GOD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECTIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Central Vision of the Bible&mdash;Building the House of God&rdquo; can be considered the highlight of the Bible and also the essence extracted from the whole Bible. The content of the Bible is wonderful. The first two chapters are one section, the last two chapters are a section, and the chapters from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 are another large section.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Genesis 3 through Revelation 20</h2>
<p>Let us consider the section from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20. In the beginning of Genesis 3 there is a serpent. This serpent seduced man and injected sin into man; consequently, death was brought in. From this point forward, the serpent, sin, and death continue until Revelation 20. However, during this period God has His work of grace. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to deal with the serpent and work righteousness into man so that, through faith in the Son of God, man can be justified by God and thereby have life and live (Rom. 1:17).</p>
<p>In this large section of the Bible the serpent, sin, and death form a background that is in contrast to Christ the Son of God and to the righteousness and life He brings. In other words, we can say that this major section of the Bible speaks of the serpent, sin, and death in contrast to Christ the Son of God, righteousness, and life. The Son of God is versus the serpent, for the Son of God was manifested that He might destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). The Son of God brought in righteousness to deal with sin, which was brought in by the serpent. Moreover, the righteousness brought in by the Son of God gives man life, and this life deals with death, which was brought in by sin (Rom. 5:21, 12). Hence, on one hand, the serpent, sin, and death are present, but on the other hand, there are Christ the Son of God, righteousness, and life.</p>
<p>The first three items are in opposition to the second three items, and all the stories in the Bible develop from these. Every event in the Bible includes these factors. In Genesis 3 the serpent, sin, and death came in. Then God said that the seed of a woman would bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head (v. 15). In addition, God prepared coats of skin for the sinners, Adam and Eve (v. 21), to cover the shame of their nakedness. The coats of skin typify Christ as the Lamb of God with the righteousness of God to deal with sin. After hearing God&rsquo;s word, Adam named his wife Eve, which means living, &ldquo;because she was the mother of all living&rdquo; (v. 20). This indicates that life came. Although the serpent brought in death, God&rsquo;s salvation brought in life.</p>
<p>Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 speaks, on the negative side, concerning the serpent, sin, and death and, on the positive side, reveals Christ the Son of God, righteousness, and life. When Christ came in the New Testament, righteousness and life also came (Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; John 1:4). At the end of Revelation Christ will judge the serpent, sin, those who followed the serpent and are defiled by sin, and death. In chapter 20 the serpent will be bound and cast into the abyss for a thousand years (vv. 1-3), and then he will be cast into the lake of fire (v. 10). All those who are defiled by sin will be judged and cast into the lake of fire as well (vv. 12-13, 15; 21:8). Finally, even death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire (20:14). This large section of the Scriptures from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is a story of two sides: of the serpent bringing in sin and death and of Christ dealing with the serpent, righteousness dealing with sin, and life swallowing up death. The three negative items of Satan, sin, and death are resolved in Revelation 20, the end of this section.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Two Chapters of Genesis and<br />
the Last Two Chapters of Revelation</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Similarities</h2>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis form a section, and the last two chapters of Revelation also form a section. The content of these two sections marvelously reflect each other. First, both sections contain the tree of life. The tree of life is first spoken of in Genesis 2:9 and is not explicitly mentioned until Revelation. In Genesis 3 the way to the tree of life is closed (vv. 22-24). After these verses the tree of life seems to disappear, but it is spoken of again in the last two chapters of the Bible. Hence, the first and last sections of the Bible reflect each other, having the tree of life as their focus. Second, both sections contain a river. There is a river in Genesis 2:10 and also in Revelation 22:1. Third, both sections contain three kinds of materials&mdash;gold, pearl (bdellium), and precious stones (Gen. 2:11-12; Rev. 21:18-21). Fourth, both sections speak of a counterpart, a wife (Gen. 2:18, 21-24; Rev. 21:9). These four points are the main content of the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible. If we remove these four points from Genesis 1&mdash;2 and Revelation 21&mdash;22, these four chapters would not have much content. Therefore, the content of the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible truly reflect each other.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
