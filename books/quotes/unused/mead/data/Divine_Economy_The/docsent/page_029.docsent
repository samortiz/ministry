   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING THE PRODUCT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 1:19-23 tells us that when Christ was resurrected, the power to raise Him up was surpassingly great.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That power surpasses everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It surpasses the tomb, Hades, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a surpassing great power uplifted Him to the heavens, subjected everything under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things for the purpose of producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the church is the product of Christ's surpassing resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we were regenerated two thousand years ago, the church also was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we were to speak about these things to some, they may feel that we are dreamers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, we are not dreamers, but we are talking about matters in another universe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This universe is not the natural universe, but the universe of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not belong to the universe of nature, but to the universe of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is the product of Christ's resurrection, the result of the life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is altogether not natural, but purely a matter in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we live by our natural life in a natural way, we are no longer the church because the church is absolutely a matter in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church was not created by God but resurrected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 2 God did not create Eve; He only created Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam was created, but Eve was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam was created by God, but God did not create a wife for him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam Gen 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible sleep signifies death 1 Thes 4:13; John 11:11-14; 1 Cor 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then God opened up Adam's side and took one of his ribs and builded this rib into a wife for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Adam awoke, he saw a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This wife was not something in creation but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Something living came out of Adam and that was Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God used Adam's rib to build a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This wife was not created but built in resurrection, and this wife is a figure of the church according to Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church was not created by God but something resurrected out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just like Adam, Christ was "put to sleep" on the cross and His side was opened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Out of the Lord's pierced side came blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The blood is for redemption to take care of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The rib out of Adam's side signifies the unbreakable eternal life, and the water out of the Lord's side also signifies the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The bone of Adam typifies the divine life that is also signified by the water flowing out of Christ's side.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>None of the Lord's bones were broken on the cross John 19:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This signifies that His divine life cannot be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His physical life was killed, but nothing could break His divine life which flows out to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With the rib, God builded a wife, and with the flowing water, God produced the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the church is not something created by God but something produced in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the church is altogether a matter in resurrection, we must abandon all our natural ways to do things, and abandon our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is in resurrection, and the church is one with Christ just as Eve became one with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They two became one flesh, and Christ and the church became one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul refers to the matter of Christ and the church as the great mystery Eph 5:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 is the result of the divine life dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through the surpassing resurrection of Christ, the life of God in Christ has been dispensed into all His believers, thus producing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord for the resurrection of Christ, through which we were regenerated and the church was produced!</S>
