It is mountainous and has more than twenty small villages. In 1928 a few brothers and two sisters heard the Word in Ch'iao Tun Men and were saved. The most marvelous thing was that one of them was a famous gambler (Brother Lee Kung Lieh). He had some schooling in the past, and after being saved, he became very zealous and obeyed the Lord. In 1930 they rented a house on Wu Tai Mountain for meeting. It has three rooms; one of which is a hut. Now there are about twelve brothers and five sisters who break bread to remember the Lord. They have all been saved over the past five or six years. Two or three brothers are capable of bearing the responsibility for speaking the Word on the Lord's Day morning. Brother Lee Kung Lieh is responsible for the affairs of the meeting. Now their work is very much in one accord. However, their knowledge of the Bible is immature. We should pray for them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Lan Sung Yang</H2><P>Lan Sung Yang is about twenty miles from Wu Tai Mountain. Since 1928 there have been four or five saved brothers meeting there in a small hut. Brothers Su Chieh Min and Lee Yi Lan are the responsible ones. Brother Su was a school teacher; until recently he could not be free for the Lord's work, so he quit his job as a teacher and is wholeheartedly learning to work for the Lord. He also farms a little rice and potatoes to provide for his wife and children. His living is very hard. Brother Lee had a small business before he was saved, but it was entangling him in his work for the Lord. He now farms and works zealously for the Lord to help the meeting there. However, there are no baptized sisters in the meeting. They feel that the building for the table meeting is not so appropriate or good. We should pray for them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Fan Shan</H2><P>Fan Shan is about ten miles from Lan Sung Yang. It is very mountainous. In 1931 some zealous brothers and sisters returned from a conference in Ch'iao Tun Men and were enlightened and strengthened by the Lord to rise up strongly in one accord to leave a certain denomination. At that time they began meeting in Brother Kuo Jih T'ung's living room. Now there are six brothers and three sisters in the table meeting. Brother Chen Shu Yao is responsible for the affairs of the meeting. Sister Chen is very zealous. However, they have many business affairs to distract them. We should pray for them that they can faithfully serve the Lord so that the meeting and work can go on.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Five Localities in P'u Men</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Ma Jan</H2><P>In Ma Jan there were three brothers, Fan P'ei Chen, Wen Ching Yi, and Fan Yun Shan, who were zealous seekers of the Lord in the Ma Jan Independent Church. In recent years they were enlightened by the Lord through The Present Testimony to know that in order to faithfully obey God and be in God's work they must depart from error. In August of 1933 there were more than twenty brothers and sisters in one accord. They met in Brother P'ei Chen's house for the table meeting. The number of those who come to listen to the Word has increased over time. If they could rent another quieter house for their meetings, it would be better. I hope the brothers and sisters who are of the same mind will pray for the meeting in Ma Jan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Yun Che</H2><P>Yun Che is about ten miles from Ma Jan and fifteen miles from Fan Shan. It is a remote mountain village with several dozen households. In about 1929, there were five saved brothers and three saved sisters. None of them could read. They met in a grass hut. Now they can read the Bible. On the Lord's Day they meet in the morning to remember the Lord and in the afternoon for the preaching of the Word. They bear this responsibility themselves. Occasionally some workers go to visit them and witness their zealous pursuit. The Lord's grace is really with them. Two brothers, Lin Wei Ch'ing and Hung Ts'ai Min, are responsible for the affairs of the meeting. May the Lord grace them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Meeting in Lee Chia Ching</H2><P>The brothers meeting in Lee Chia Ching are Lee Kuan Hsin and Lee Hsi T'ui. They used to meet in an Independent Church in P'u City (about five or six miles away). In 1929 they received the Lord's light and leading and realized the importance of leaving man's tradition and obeying the Bible. They were very much moved by the Holy Spirit to have a prayer meeting in Lee Chia Ching. The Lord had prepared the situation for them, and many were saved there. At that time the Lord wanted them to meet in Lee Chia Ching. To their surprise they were placed in charge of a house. Now there are about thirty brothers and sisters breaking bread together. Kuan Hsin and Hsi T'ui are responsible for the affairs of the meeting. May the Lord grace them with His presence that His work may be greatly revived.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
