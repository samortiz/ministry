   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING, PRESENT WORD OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By these few words, Peter became quite clear that the Lord need not pay the tribute.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He came to realize fully that the Son is free.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the Lord said, in effect, Nevertheless, lest we offend them, we should pay.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we say Yes, Jesus may say No. When we say No, He may say Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In my experience very often when I said Yes, the Lord Jesus would say No. And then when I followed Him to say No, He would then say Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seems that He is a real trouble-maker.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not such a simple lesson to learn to do whatever the Lord says, regardless of what He has said in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Peter learned his lesson in a hard way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said that He would pay the tribute to keep from offending the others, but He would not give money to Peter for him to pay it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No, Peter needed to go fishing to find some money in the mouth of a fish, money that would be sufficient for both the Lord and himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I were Peter, in a sense, I would not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord gave him a difficult task.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Go fishing, and find the money in the mouth of the first fish that comes up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not know how long Peter had to wait for that fish, but I am sure that by that experience he learned a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He may have said, O Lord, from now on I will never forget the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I will never forget what I heard from the heavens at the transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The next time someone asks me a question, I will answer according to what I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was a good lesson for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, the fish came, and the money was there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then he paid the half-shekel for the Lord and for himself, and the problem was solved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was by such a simple matter that the Lord caused Peter to know that today it is not Moses who gives the commandment, but Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord says to pay, we pay; when He says not to pay, we do not pay.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now Peter paid the half-shekel not according to what Moses said, but according to what Christ said.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now to pay the poll tax is not a matter of keeping the law of Moses, but a matter of keeping the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In that sense, there is no need to obey the law of Moses any longer that is over.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, Christ is the present and living Law-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should forget about Moses and apply Christ in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He says to pay, we pay.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He says not to pay, we do not pay.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not a matter of listening to Moses, but a matter of listening to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not a matter of paying or not paying, but a matter of what Christ says.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because Christ today is within us, it is not a matter of doing or not doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is altogether a matter of listening to the living, present word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not a matter of cutting your hair short, for example, or of wearing it long.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is absolutely a matter of listening to the living word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is today s New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE NEW MOSES AND THE NEW ELIJAH</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this test, the Lord Jesus made it clear to Peter that He is today s Moses, He is the present Law-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The old Moses is over; the old Moses was finished at the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the new Moses, the unique Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should listen to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This Moses is in contradiction to us; that is, when we say Yes, He will say No. Furthermore, He has a stronger argument to prove that He is right.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then after we are convinced that we should follow Him, He may say something different.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Either way, the case is in His hand, because today He is the living Law-giver; therefore, whatever He says is right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not say anything, but let Him do all the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When He says Yes, we say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When He says No, we also say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The problem with Moses is that when he gives the commandment, he simply gives the commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He does not supply the strength to fulfill that commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moses told the people to pay the half-shekel, but he did not offer the strength to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moses said, Pay! but he offered no payment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, when Christ asks us to pay, He supplies the payment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the Lord gives the commandment, He affords the strength to fulfill it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is the present, living Law-giver with the strength to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Moses of the old dispensation is over; Christ is the Moses of the new dispensation, the new Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, Christ is not only the present Moses, but He is also today s Prophet, the Prophet who is living in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He prophesied that a fish would come and that a piece of money would be found in the fish s mouth, money sufficient to pay the half-shekel for Him and for Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This was not a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It was not like the so-called prophecies of today that say, Thus saith the Lord: There will be a big earthquake, and Los Angeles will fall into the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What does a so-called prophecy such as this have to do with our daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The prophecy of Jesus was not so great.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was such a small thing, but it had a real meaning for Peter s daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This Jesus is the real Prophet, the living Prophet, the Prophet in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He does not give a lot of teaching and doctrine, but He gives simply a little prediction with a living instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we will take His word and go along with His instruction, we will receive the help.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not need the big terms and the big teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need something living and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We do not need a great prophecy that has no meaning, but we need a few little words that teach us some lesson and supply some need.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By this we can realize that Jesus is the living, present Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do not need the Moses and Elijah of the old dispensation any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Christ is everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you will not misunderstand me, I will say also that because we have Christ, we do not need the Bible in the same way that we need Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To uplift the Bible to the level of Christ Himself could even be an insult to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If I wrote you a letter a month ago, yet today while I am here in your presence you will not talk to me but merely quote my letter, that would be an insult to me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In a sense, the Bible is the letter of Christ to us, and we need to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, when Christ Himself comes, we should go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I believe you can understand what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If there is a group of people on this earth who love the Bible, surely I must be one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Nevertheless, I would tell you that the Bible cannot be on the same level as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The written Word of God cannot compete with the living Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A picture or a photo cannot compete with the real person.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I love the Holy Bible, but I would not uplift it to the same level as the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I love the Bible, but I love the presence of the Lord more.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It must be Jesus only.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He is the One who says Yes or No to me, and He is the One who predicts things in my daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is my law and He is my prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He is my living Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is today s New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In God s economy, there is only one person, one man, one center.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is Christ, not Moses or Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Christ is the One who gives the commandments, and He is also the One who prophesies.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is by His prophecy that we may know how to keep His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Christ is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He is all we need.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is not Christ and something else.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>It is Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There is no more Moses or Elijah, but Jesus only.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He is today s Moses and today s Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He is not only the living Law-giver, but also the living Prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He is today s everything!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He is the One who is qualified to give the commandments, and He is also the One who predicts and affords the strength to fulfill what He commands.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He gave the commandment to pay the half-shekel, and He predicted the way to get the money to pay it.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is Christ today in the New Testament service.</S>
