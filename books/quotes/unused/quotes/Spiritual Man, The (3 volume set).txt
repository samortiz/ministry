The following explanation by the author himself on the nature of the book is quoted from an announcement in Issue No
The most frustrating experience of believers today is that in seeking for progress on the spiritual path, they do not find the proper way
Almost every chapter begins from the position of the sinner and goes on step by step toward the peak of spiritual life
Thank the Lord that since the publication of this book in the fall of 1928, believers from various places have put in orders for it
The Bible does not speak of 'the overcoming of sins,' but 'the deliverance from sin' and 'being freed from sin'
God's way of salvation is not for us to overcome sin, but to crucify our old man so that we are delivered from sin and the power of sin
We thought that if we were right in the spiritual facts and principles, outward terminology would not matter much
He has shown us how an inaccurate term can lead to inaccurate truths, and how accuracy in terminology is equally important
The readers should know that the various truths mentioned in this book are not meant to be all that can be said about them
Among the spiritually seeking believers there is always the danger of excessive subjectivity concerning one's own spiritual experience
The Bible does permit believers to relate their own experience; this is something that the Holy Spirit would lead men to do
Experiences that are as wonderful and profound as the rapture 'to the third heaven' should better wait 'fourteen years' to be mentioned
During the past few years, the truths in this book particularly those in Volume Three have released many from the authority of darkness
The degrees of spiritual life mentioned in this book are also quite varied from one section of the book to the other
If he will read the book again after a while, perhaps after half a month or a month, he will find that he will understand more of them
When many believers first get the taste of a certain level of spirituality, they think that they have already attained to that level
When a believer has tasted a certain level but has not entered fully into it, he can take advantage of the teachings of this book
If we see in God's light, we will have the knowledge of ourselves, and at the same time we will not lose our broadness in the Lord
If a believer limits God's way of salvation and is satisfied only with victory over sin, he is short of God's will
It is good to overcome sin, but unless one overcomes the natural narrowness and the supernatural evil, he is not perfect
The result of our study is that with every spiritual experience, such as regeneration, there are specific changes within our inner man
After we have studied this subject, we have found that the Bible divides a man into three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body
Later on, we will consider the function of these three parts, in particular, the functions of the spirit and the soul
Today this teaching is very much lacking in China, and that is why we cover the subject in detail in Section One
Those who are not familiar with this kind of distinction should just remember the conclusion for now, and should go on to read Section Two
We are not concerned with the bluntness of the style; our aim is only to convey the spiritual meaning of the word
Others such as Otto Stockmayer, Jessie Penn-Lewis, Evan Roberts, and Madame Guyon have given similar testimonies
Does the Lord only want us to help others not to sin, on the negative side, and become zealous, on the positive side?
If it pleases Him, may He bless it so that my brothers and sisters will grow in spiritual life and overcome in spiritual warfare
If a man has never set out to write a book like this, he will not realize in reality how many difficulties there are
Therefore Jehovah's word to them will be:/Rule upon rule, rule upon rule;/Line upon line, line upon line;/Here a little, there a little'
When readers come to these places, they should realize that in actuality, there are no contradictions; they only appear to be so
When we read a book like this we have to be careful lest we receive its teachings in the mind only thinking that we have acquired everything
After reading a book of this nature, it would be very easy for us to unconsciously have excessive self-analysis
In this way, we may advance much outwardly, but in reality, the self-life will become more difficult to reject
When we expect to see holiness filling us, yet find that our condition is not as we have expected, we will naturally feel uneasy
Real spiritual life depends not on continuous analysis of our own feelings and thoughts but on looking away to the Savior!
We commonly consider it to be soulish when one is too emotional, and we think that to be soulish is to be emotional
At one time we might have considered the emotion and the excitement in the soul to be good and might have walked according to them
In short, if a believer over-suppresses his emotion, he will only become a person living in his mentality and will not be a spiritual person
My request now is that in our sickness we should differentiate between the things that come from ourselves and the things that come from God
If you have the courage and the patience to go on after reading Section One, God will perhaps bless you with the truth contained in it
May You preserve Your children in this end time and deliver them from the corrupted flesh and the wicked evil spirits
What we have covered is but an outline of these subjects; there are still many areas which we have not covered
The soul is the invisible part, the psychological part within man, and the body is the visible part, the outward form of man
In addition to being different terms, the soul and the spirit are actually two different substances; they are not the same
Thessalonians 5:23 says, 'The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete'
Many times they take something soulish as spiritual, constantly remain in a soulish living, and do not seek after spiritual things
The most important thing is whether or not a believer is willing to be humble and to receive the teaching of the Holy Spirit
If he is the Holy Spirit will in his experience separate his soul from his spirit though he may not even have the knowledge about this truth
In the beginning, God created the figure of a man with the dust of the earth and then breathed into his nostrils 'the breath of life'
The spirit that was received in the beginning is not the life of God that we received at the time of our regeneration
The life which we received at the time of our regeneration is the life of God Himself; it is the life represented by the tree of life
When the spirit caused the body to come alive, man became a living soul, a living person with his own consciousness
In other words, the soul and the body are fully joined to the spirit, and the spirit and the body are incorporated into the soul
Before Adam fell, his spirit and his flesh were of course not in conflict with each other daily as it is with us today
The soul served as the linking chain, the seat of man's personality, making it possible for man to exist independently
In the same way, the spirit and the body were two independent elements, but after they combined, the combination became a living soul
The soul bears the characteristics of the combination of the spirit and the body; it is the product of the union of the two things
The body is the 'world-consciousness,' the soul is the 'self-consciousness,' and the spirit is the 'God-consciousness'
He communicates with the outside world of senses through the body; the world and the body interact with one another
When the spirit wanted to do something, it communicated to the soul, and the soul activated the body to follow the order of the spirit
The spirit first communicates the exultation to the soul, then the soul expresses this exultation through the organs of the body
When the spirit controls the whole being, it is because the soul has yielded itself and has taken a lower position
The apostle said in 1 Corinthians 3:16, 'Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you'?
Although they are very close, they are not the closest, because they are still outside the veil and cannot enter into God's presence
In this place there is much light, everything is clear and obvious, and the priests come in and out to serve God
Further in, there is the Holy of Holies behind the veil, which is unreachable by human light and is a place invisible to the human eyes
All the actions in the outer court and the Holy Place are determined by the presence of God in the Holy of Holies
The holiest place within the temple and the place which all other places are subject to and depend on is the Holy of Holies
Before man fell, although there were many activities and works with the soul, they were all under the control of the spirit
According to the teaching of the Bible and the experience of the believers mans spirit is composed of three parts or it has three functions
The spirit contains the function of the conscience, although this does not mean that the spirit is the conscience
From these verses we see that the spirit includes at least three parts the conscience, the intuition, and the fellowship
Although an unregenerated person has not received life, he still has his conscience, intuition, and fellowship
With some, the manifestation of the spirit is more, while with others, the manifestation of the spirit is less
The reason we study the main features of the spirit is to show that man has a spirit which is independent of his other parts
Because the believers have long been controlled by the soul, they have become very weak in their knowledge of the spirit
In addition, because the main functions of the spirit towards God are lost and dead, they have become accessories to the soul
When the functions of the mind, emotion, and will in the soul become strong, the functions of the spirit become obliterated
Even after a believer is regenerated, there is still the need for the work of dividing the soul from the spirit
If we search the Scripture , we will find out that the spirit of an unregenerated person seems to do the same work as that of his soul
A man does not lose the organ of the spirit and does not cause the spirit to disappear just because his soul has taken control
Everything included in man's personality, that is, every element that constitutes him a man, is a part of the soul
The reason for this is that the soul is the location of man's personality and the chief element of his personality
If we study the Bible carefully, we will find that the three main elements of man's personality belong to the soul
The setting, the lifting up, the refusing, and the choosing are all functions of man's will, and they all issue from the soul
Some who have studied the Bible have pointed out that there are three words for life in Greek: bios, psuche, and zoe
They are distinguishable because in some places psuche can be considered the soul or the life, but not vice versa
On the other hand, the soul and man's own life are inseparable because the two things are fully integrated within man
We have seen many verses that prove that the soul contains the faculties of the mind, the emotion, and the will
We know that man's thoughts, imaginations, judgments, feelings, emotions, stimulations, and desires all come from the soul
All the things in the natural realm that are included in man's personality are the various faculties of the soul
In Exodus 12:16, 'That which every man must eat' is, in the original language, 'That which every soul must eat'
In Leviticus 2:1, 'When a person brings a meal offering' is, in the original language, 'When a soul brings a meal offering'
In Amos 6:8, 'The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself' is, in the original language, 'The Lord Jehovah has sworn by the soul'
In Luke 12:19 the foolish rich man spoke comforting words to his own soul, meaning that he spoke comforting words to himself
The above examples show that in these cases, if we translate the word into 'soul' or 'life,' it would become meaningless
Matthew 16:26 says, 'For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life ?
From this study we draw the conclusion that the human soul encompasses everything that makes up the person as a human being
Whether it be God or the devil, no one can work on us without the consent of our will, because man's will is free
Under normal conditions, the spirit is like the lady of a house, the soul is like the steward, while the body is like the servants
When the lady of the house needs something done, she charges the steward, and the steward in turn directs the servants to do it accordingly
Unfortunately, man fell, failed, and sinned, so that the original, proper order of the spirit, soul, and body was overturned
God's original goal was for man to receive and digest God's spiritual life with the truth and reality in this spiritual life
If that were the case, the soul-life would have been fully filled with the spirit-life, and man's whole being would have become spiritual
We know that between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man's soul did not choose the tree of life
He also promised that the fruit of all trees except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil could be eaten freely
The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the fruit that uplifts man's soul and dampens man's spirit
When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, surely his soulish life developed and was uplifted
Once the soulish life develops and is uplifted, the spiritual life is suppressed, loses the knowledge of God, and becomes as dead
Most servants of God would agree that the tree of life here is the life that God gives to man in His Son Jesus Christ
If we understand the origin of the soul and the principle of its life, we will be greatly helped in our spiritual life
When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his soulish life developed, and he fell into the place of death
Once she decided to answer the question, she had to exercise her mind, and her soul had to act contrary to the spirit and beyond its limit
The enemy tempted her by telling her that if she would eat, her eyes would be opened, and she would be like God, knowing good and evil
And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise'
As a result her spirit rebelled against God, and she wondered whether God had forbidden her to eat because His intention was wicked
Not only the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes made the demands, but the curiosity in the soul urged her to pursue further
The activity of the soul can many times be detected in the pursuit for wisdom and knowledge, including spiritual knowledge
Since man's fall came from the pursuit of knowledge, God used the foolishness of the cross to destroy the wisdom of the wise
If a man desires to be saved, he has to believe in the foolishness of the cross in order that he would not trust in intellectual power
When we read the word of the apostle, we find that Adam sinned purposely and was not like Eve who sinned through being beguiled
All the devil's works go from the outside to the inside, while all the works of God's Spirit go from the inside to the outside
We must be careful to realize that the soul is the organ of mans personality it is the part that expresses mans free will and is mans master
If we study the nature of Adam's sin, we will find that besides rebellion, there is also the matter of independence
Man wants to have knowledge that God has not given to him and tries to gain the things outside of God by exercising his own will
To be soulish is to turn away from God and to freely seek after what God has not given, in particular, to seek after knowledge
Within a man, the tree of life cannot grow vigorously by the side of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
The spirit has God-consciousness; it knows God's voice, fellowships with God, and has a very keen knowledge of God
Thereafter, man may have religion, morality, education, ability, power, and mental and physical health, yet he is dead to God
When the inner man within him became disorganized and fallen, his outer body was destined to death and destruction
Soon after, through the soul's suppression, the spirit was merged with the soul, and the two parts became closely knit together
Sometimes a fallen one can have a spirit that is stronger than his soul or his body and that can still rule over his whole being
Their spirits are dead to God but alive to Satan and receptive to the operation of the evil spirits within them
The lusts of the body, its feelings and demands, are all summoning the soul to obey, to carry out their commands, and to gratify them
The result of such a fully soulish condition is to mock, to go on according to one's own lusts, and to make divisions
The world thinks that man's intellectual power and his reason are almighty, that he can find out all kinds of truth in the world by his mind
Even when a man is soulish, many times he still realizes the uncertainties of this life and seeks for eternal life in the coming age
Indeed, unless intellectual power comes under the leading of the Holy Spirit, it is unreliable and is very dangerous
Since the soul once obeyed the body to rebel against God's demand, it has to continue its obedience to the body
The authority of this body is so great that it causes the soul to become powerless to withstand it and only be its obedient slave
Sin has killed the spirit, and now spiritual death has come to all men so that all men die in sin and transgressions
Sin has also caused the soul to become independent so that the soulish life now becomes an independent and selfish life
Not only has death 'passed on to all men,' but according to the literal translation of this phrase, death 'passed through all men'
The righteousness accomplished by the one man Christ becomes the righteousness of all mankind, both past and present
As Abraham gave to Melchisedec a tenth of all and also received the blessing from Melchisedec, so Melchisedec is greater than Levi
We know Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Levi; therefore, Levi was the great-grandson of Abraham
When Adam transgressed, all were in his loins, and when Christ was judged, the lives of all regenerated sinners were also in His loins
His hands His feet His forehead His side and His heart were all pierced by men pierced by sinful human nature and for sinful human nature
Although He had the power to avoid these sufferings, He gave His body over willingly to suffer these indescribable pains and agonies
He chose to drink the cup given Him by God and would not drink the cup that would result in the loss of consciousness
Even his body belonged to his master; therefore, the cross, the most shameful punishment, was applied to runaway slaves
We were slaves of lust, temper, habits, and the world; we were sold to sin; but He died for our enslavement and bore all our shame
Because He bore the curse and the shame of the cross, all who believe in Him no longer need to bear the curse and the shame
It was a fact that in the unfathomable eternity 'I and the Father are one' , and this remained true when He was on earth
When He saw the death of Lazarus, perhaps He thought about His own death, so He 'was moved with indignation in His spirit'
When He was on the hill of Golgotha receiving God's judgment, He cried, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me'?
Many bulls surround me,/The mighty bulls of Bashan encompass me, / They open their mouth at me,/Like a ravening and roaring lion'
His spirit, on the one hand, felt God's forsaking, and on the other hand, was resisting the evil spirit's sneering and mocking
The necessary punishments for the body, the soul, and the spirit of the sinner have all been executed upon the Lord Jesus
From now on, whoever is willing to receive the cross will be regenerated by the Holy Spirit and receive the life of the Lord Jesus
We should therefore keep in mind that God always deals with man by means of mans spirit and also accomplishes His plan through mans spirit
Otherwise, death will come, and the spirit will be severed from its union with God and become disconnected from the life of God
We have mentioned before that this does not mean that man no longer has a spirit, but that the spirit yields its high position to the soul
When man's spirit obeys the urge from his 'outward man' in the form of ideals and desires, the result is his loss of fellowship with God
Those who are dead in 'offenses and sins' are those who fulfill 'the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts'
Man has the conditions of anxiety curiosity joy pride compassion debauchery delight astonishment shame love regret excitement and happiness
Man has ideals, imaginations, superstitions, doubts, suppositions, investigations, inferences, examinations, analyses, reflections, etc
One may repent of offenses, be sorrowful for sin, and resolve to improve with tears; yet this is not salvation
In the matter of salvation, man's will, emotion, and mind are not the basic or primary items; rather, they are secondary, subordinate
For this reason every worker for the Lord ought to understand that our natural abilities cannot cause anyone to be born again
If they do, all of the fruit will only be in the realm of the soul and will not penetrate deeper into man's spirit
The sinner spirit, soul, and body with all his sins, has been completely judged in the Lord Jesus on the cross
On man's side one work still remains; that is, by faith he must join himself spirit, soul, and body unto the Lord Jesus
The sinner must exercise faith to believe into the Lord Jesus, to be joined unto His death, and thus be one in His resurrection
We must be careful not to consider the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus and our co-death with Him as two separate matters
The faith by which a sinner believes in the substitutionary death of the Lord Jesus is the believing into Christ to be joined to Him
if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection'
We must avoid the thought that man ought to have the experience of dying and resurrecting with the Lord before he can be born again
Our being born again is our co-resurrection with the Lord because the Lord's death terminated the problem of our sinful life
The apostle Paul in Philippians 3 told us that every Christian still needs to pursue to know 'the power of His resurrection'
Many Christians are born again and have participated in the Lord's resurrection but lack the manifestation of the power of resurrection
Because the old spirit was dead, the Holy Spirit puts the uncreated life of God inside it, causing it to have life and to live
The soul became the life of the spirit, the 'self' became the life of the soul, and the lust became the life of the body
After mans regeneration the Holy Spirit rules his spirit causing his spirit to govern his soul then through the soul to rule over his body
That is, regeneration not only restores us to the condition of Adam before his fall, but it also affords us something additional
As the angels were called sons of God, Adam was also called a son of God , because he was created directly by God
What we Christians obtain at regeneration is God's life, a life which was possible for Adam to obtain, but he did not obtain it
Man's deadened, fallen spirit is made alive by receiving God's life imparted through the power of the Holy Spirit
Because this life is God's life, which can never die, all who have been regenerated have this life and are said to 'have eternal life'
Man, once born of God, despite how long eternity may be, has a relationship and position which cannot be canceled
After regeneration there is still an immensely great capacity in God's life that will allow him to advance unceasingly
It was not only his nature or merely any one part of his being which was fleshy; it was 'I' as a person, the whole being of Paul was fleshy
It is very clear here that the flesh in biblical usage refers to all that is in man when he is still in an unregenerated state
At the fall of man, the soul rejected the authority of the spirit and became enslaved to the body and its lustful desires
Flesh is that part of the body which is full of consciousness and it is through the flesh that we receive our feelings of the physical world
What the flesh consists of is not flesh alone although it includes flesh but also the man who walks after the consciousness of the flesh
He says that if you wish to overcome the flesh, you need to put to death the practices of the body 'by the Spirit'
No man in the world is regarded by the Bible as non-fleshly for all men are subjected to the control of the flesh
Since all men are fleshly, the word sarx is used in speaking of the carnality of man as well as of man himself
Whatever a man may have inborn in him or may have derived from nature when he was born of his parents is flesh
Good he is, however virtuous he may be, whatever talents he may have, or however kind and intelligent he may be, he is fleshly
In view of the Lord's word, whether man is of the flesh is not dependent on any consideration other than whether he is born of the flesh
Since he is born of the flesh, he is flesh and will remain as flesh, regardless of the amount of work or energy spent on him
If he is, then neither by any human means nor by the power of God or miracles can he be changed into something other than flesh
The Lord Jesus has said that every unregenerated man, born but once of man, is flesh and is in the realm of the flesh
The soul is subjected to the allurements of the lusts of the body and in pursuit thereof commits many unspeakable sins
Indeed, when man is in the flesh, the passions for sins, which act through the law, operate in his members to bear fruit to death
Because the strength of the flesh is exceedingly weak , it cannot satisfy God in fulfilling any of His requirements
That those who are of the flesh do not keep the law is, of course, not unusual; it shows that they are of the flesh
Although the power of God is great, God is not able to change the nature of 'the flesh' into something pleasing to Him
Because the flesh is in such a deplorable state before God, He warns His saints to hate 'even the inner garment spotted from the flesh'
God does not change the flesh of man but, instead, gives man a new life so that it may cooperate with Him to bring the flesh into death
Their mind is the 'mind set on the flesh' which is 'enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be'
The law decrees that he who keeps the law lives by the law, and he who does not keep it shall be condemned unto perdition
The answer is the whole law, for 'whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all'
Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin'
The more man strives to keep the law, the more conscious he is of his being full of sins, incapable of keeping the law of God
Since all men are sinful God prepared to save them and His way of salvation was by sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin
As He also has the likeness of the sinful flesh of man, He is very intimately affiliated with sinners of the flesh in the world
Those who are fleshy sin against the law and cannot fulfill the righteousness of God, so they must perish and suffer the punishment for sin
The Lord came to the world, took on the likeness of the flesh of sin, and wholly identified Himself with all fleshly men
He is sinless and need not have suffered punishment, but when He received the punishment, He had the likeness of sinful flesh
In the original text, the word born in the sense of to be born anew refers to giving birth, meaning we are born of God
When God saves us, He must restore in us the position of the spirit so that we may again have fellowship with God
The condition for a man to be regenerated is not that he has to do a special work, but that he must believe into the Lord Jesus as Savior
Just as people in the world cannot build a house in the air, so also we cannot help an unregenerated person to grow
Every believer should definitely know that he has been regenerated, that he has received a new life that he did not have originally
John 1 has already told us that a man is born anew because of his believing in the name of the Son of God and his receiving Him
We need to explain here what is included in man's flesh and how the Lord Jesus in His redemption deals with the elements of the flesh
If a believer desires to understand the spiritual life, he should not be confused about these two elements of the flesh
Although the Bible never tells us to be crucified for our sins, the Bible does tell us that we should bear the cross for our self
The book of Galatians shows us very clearly the relationship between a believer and these two aspects of the flesh
On the one hand, it tells us, 'But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts'
Without the teaching of the Holy Spirit, one might assume that the flesh is no longer there because his flesh has already been crucified
On the other hand, the Bible also tells us, 'Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh
It reveals to us clearly that a person who belongs to Christ Jesus, one who already has the Holy Spirit abiding in him, still has the flesh
Through the cross, Christ fully delivered the believers from the power of sin so that sin can no longer be the lord
Through the Holy Spirit, Christ abides in the believers so that they may daily overcome their self and utterly obey Him
When they hear of full salvation, they naturally grasp the grace for forgiveness of sin and neglect the grace for deliverance from sin
Because once a person is born again once he receives a new life this new life demands that he depart from the rule of the flesh to obey God
As soon as this life enters a man's spirit, it requires him to depart from his former master, sin, and completely obey the Holy Spirit
The flesh seeks to have man forever subject to itself, while the spiritual life seeks to have man utterly obedient to the Holy Spirit
They should have known that it was precisely because they were regenerated that they were having such a conflict
The new desire naturally is not willing to remain in corruption and filthiness but seeks to walk according to God's will
God gives His life to man at the time of regeneration for the purpose of destroying the self of the flesh through His life
It is through such a war that God makes the believers seek after and hold fast to the complete victory in Christ
If a believer has not obtained such a full salvation because he does not know it, through such a war he will seek to know it
If these believers do not easily give up but continue to press on faithfully, then they will have much fiercer battles
For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man'?
One cannot eliminate the works of the flesh if he does not realize that these works are the products of the flesh
By that time they should have grown into adulthood, but on the contrary they had withered away, so much so that they remained babes
As a fleshly sinner can become a regenerated believer, so can a regenerated believer who is still fleshly become spiritual
A person is regenerated because he believes in the redemption accomplished for him by the Son of God on the cross
Although they had knowledge of all things, they did not have the power to express what they knew in their practical lives
Rather, one must have a life that is completely obedient to the Holy Spirit before he can hope to be taught by the Holy Spirit
To such a person, spiritual knowledge only strengthens his carnality and helps him to deceive himself into thinking that he is spiritual
For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man'?
Men of the world are naturally fleshly, and therefore, it may be excusable for a newly regenerated person to be of the flesh
If there are still many things in our life that bear the semblance of the worldly people, then we are still of the flesh
When believers are still fleshly, they are usually overcome by the sin dwelling within, so that they have many battles and they commit sins
The requirements of our body may generally be classified under three categories: nourishment, procreation, and defense
We should not take the matter of food lightly, for too often many carnal believers have stumbled in this point
It was also because of the matter of eating and drinking that the Corinthian believers caused many of the brothers to stumble
Such fruits are anger and strife borne of man's so-called temper which have their origin in the flesh and are therefore sins of the flesh
Many sins have been produced directly and indirectly out of self-defense because sin is the motivating power within
If we analyze the numerous sins of the world one by one we shall see that they are generally related to the three categories mentioned above
It is only when God, by His Spirit, reveals the true condition of the flesh to man that man can deal with the flesh according to God's view
In Galatians 5:19-21 the sins of the flesh are compiled in a list so that there is no possibility for anyone to misunderstand
Anyone who would like to know whether or not he is of the flesh needs only to ask himself if he has done any work of the flesh
One who is of the flesh need not commit all the works enumerated in this list before he is reckoned as being of the flesh
Believers who have constantly committed the most defiling sins will naturally realize that they are of the flesh
They think that since they do not have the more defiling sins, they are no longer walking according to the flesh
Factions, divisions, sects' may appear to be cleaner in comparison with 'fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
May we pray over these three verses one by one before God at this time, so that our eyes may be opened by the Lord to know ourselves
Such a person must have an awareness of sin a second time; as a Christian, he must also convict himself concerning sin
He may have supposed that what God says is true, but he still does not know that God's perception is never wrong
Since many believers do not understand God's way of salvation, they try to overcome the flesh by making war against it
They hope with all their heart that God would grant them greater spiritual power to enable them to overcome their flesh
Little does he know that as to the subduing of the lusts of the flesh, these rules and regulations are absolutely ineffective
Man always desires to use his own methods and simply cannot bring himself to believe that he is really so corrupt
The lesson must be learned, so the Holy Spirit patiently allows him to learn of his self little by little through experience
Even when He dwells in the believers, His intention is not to help in the improvement of the flesh but to war against it
There are many believers you can say the majority of the believers who were not filled by the Holy Spirit when they believed in the Lord
After believing in the Lord for many years, they are still entangled by sins and have become fleshly believers
It is because many believers do not have the clear revelation of the cross from the beginning that they have only believed half of the truth
If the reader has completely believed the two sides of the work of the cross, this section will not be that deeply related to him
We want the reader to be clear that it is not necessary to believe the two sides of the work of the cross at separate times
In the past it was through this cross that sinners obtained regeneration and knew that they had been redeemed by the Lord from their sins
On one hand, the Savior died for the sinner on the cross to redeem him from sin so that the holy God can righteously forgive him
Rather, his spirit regains the control, the body becomes the servant on the outside, and the soul is the medium in between
If he does, he has 'crucified the flesh' on the cross he 'is' not crucifying nor 'will' he crucify, but he 'has' crucified
They who are of Christ Jesus,' whether strong or weak, 'have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts'
The believers in Corinth committed adultery, had jealousy, strife, divisions, and lawsuits, and committed many other sins
Since we are crucified with Christ, at the moment Christ was crucified on the cross, our flesh also was crucified on the cross
Whether people have the experience or not, God's Word says, 'They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh'
If we want to have the way to experience the crucifixion of the flesh, we do not need to pay attention to experience
If we are firm on this point the flesh has been crucified we will be able to go on to deal with the flesh in our experience
Those who want to have the experience should not care first for their own experience but only believe in God's Word
Now, the only questions are how do we deal with what He has done and what is our attitude toward what He has accomplished
Now the questions are whether we believe that this is real and whether we want this to be accomplished in our life
Some only know that their flesh has been crucified with the Lord Jesus on the cross and do not pursue the practice
Otherwise, even though we eagerly pursue experience, relying vainly on our own efforts, we will not have the experience
You died' you died with the Lord Jesus because, when the Lord Jesus died, He crucified your flesh on the cross
Therefore,' you now need to practice applying the death of the Lord to put to death all the practices of the members
The death of the Lord is the most authoritative death, the most fatal death, and whatever meets it cannot but die
The evil practices of the flesh at all times and in every place are ready to come out and be manifested from our body
Unless the Spirit empowers the believer with the power of the holy death of the Lord Jesus, the believer cannot overcome
Whenever a believer is not walking by the Spirit and being led by the Spirit, right away he is walking by the flesh
The real condition of the flesh which God reveals to us in Romans 7, after verse 5, is the real condition of the believer himself
If for one moment the believer stops walking by the Spirit, he right away becomes the kind of person about whom we are speaking
Whenever the believer does not walk according to the Holy Spirit in chapter eight, there immediately is the experience of chapter seven
With the flesh, the law of sin' means that no matter how he served the law of God with his mind, his flesh always served the law of sin
No matter how our life in the Holy Spirit is growing and rooted, the flesh has not changed its nature and still serves the law of sin
We need to realize that even though we can put to death the flesh and cause it to be annulled , it nevertheless still exists
Whether it is the flesh or 'the fleshly nature' as people have called it, it always exists within the believer
Before we are separated from this body, we can never be separated from our flesh such that it has no possibility to operate again
If Paul still had the flesh according to which he might war , who would dare to say that he did not have 'flesh'?
Herein is a fact: children born of regenerated and sanctified parents are also fleshly and need to be regenerated even as the worldly people
No one can say that the children born of sanctified believers are not fleshly and have no need of regeneration
The reason that the believers' children have a sinful nature is that the believers have a sinful nature and have passed it on to them
Sometimes his feelings and his desire are not perfect and are mostly more base than those of Adam when he was sinless
Unless man's flesh has been rooted out from within man, he can never have the perfect feeling, desire, and love
If a believer does not walk according to the Holy Spirit and still gives ground to the flesh, the flesh will exercise its dominion again
If a believer walks according to the Holy Spirit , no matter what sin devises, it cannot cause the believer to stumble
In this way the body is not reigned over by the sinful nature and is free to be the temple of the Holy Spirit and to do the holy work of God
Because the believers answer God with the vital yes and answer the flesh with the vital no accepting the Lords death they obtain freedom
In this life, before the separation from the body, this 'yes' to God and 'no' to the flesh have to always continue
Good discernment, watchfulness, prayer, and sometimes fasting are necessary that he may know how to walk according to the Holy Spirit
If we are now willing to put to death the practices of our body by the Holy Spirit, we will experience the accomplishment of the cross
Since God has such grace and such a way of salvation, if we make the mistake of still living according to the flesh, it our responsibility
Since we have such a salvation, it is no longer as though we are debtors to the flesh and are obliged to pay it
What God has arranged for you is to put all the ability and activity of your flesh under the power of the death of the Lord Jesus' cross
You should talk less about life and talk first about death, because if there is no death, there is no resurrection
According to the Bible, the works of the 'flesh' are divided into two kinds : the unrighteous and the self-righteous
When the flesh commits sins, rebels against God, and breaks the law of God, it is clearly opposed to the spirit
The soul is the principle by which man lives; it is also his very self which is composed of the faculties of his will, mind, and emotion
Even though the conduct of this part of the flesh is not as defiling as that of the other part, it is still at enmity with the Holy Spirit
The believers have not learned to hate their flesh the entire flesh but hope only to be freed from sins, which issue out from the flesh
They know to reject the activities of the flesh, but they do not know that the flesh itself should be destroyed
According to the teaching of the Bible, there is no one in the world who is not of the flesh, because all sinners are born of the flesh
What one does by the flesh one does by himself; such works cannot perfect the works which the Holy Spirit has begun
The apostle always tore down the works of sinners because he considered their works as being unable to save them
The apostle seemed to be saying, 'You cannot be saved by your own works, but you have been justified by believing in the Lord'
Of course, trying to please God is also a righteous deed of the flesh, except that such deeds cannot please God
As far as the soul is concerned, all the activities of the will, the mind, and the emotion are not necessarily as defiling as lusts
He does not realize that as the evil acts of the flesh belong to the flesh, so the good deeds of the flesh also belong to the flesh
If the goodness of the flesh is not eradicated, no matter what the believer does, he cannot be delivered from the power of the flesh
Since the flesh can do good and if the believer allows it to do good, he will soon see the flesh doing evil also
God's purpose is that the believers would be completely free of the old creation and enter completely into the new creation in experience
God wants man to come completely helpless before Him, submitting wholly to His Holy Spirit and waiting on Him humbly and trustfully
They do not have a teachable heart that is willing to wait on God and to let Him reveal His truth in His light
The time spent in the employment of human methods and arrangements is more than the time spent waiting before God
The time spent on preparing the items and sections of the message far exceeds the time spent on receiving the power from above
If the believers want to understand the works of the flesh, there is no other need than to put the flesh to the test
Anything that one can decide according to one's own will and for which one does not need to seek God's will is of the flesh
As long as the flesh is allowed to live and is given the opportunity to be active, it is willing to do anything, even submit to God!
The experience of the believers shows us that what is of the Spirit in the beginning can easily become something of the flesh
Oftentimes when one receives a truth, one receives it of the Holy Spirit, but after a while this truth becomes the boasting of his flesh
The believer also feels that this life is very simple and very sweet and that henceforth nothing will hinder him from obtaining this life
He does not depend completely on the leading of the Holy Spirit to accomplish all the work, nor does he wait on the Lord
The greatest error of a believer is that after having overcome sins by the Lord, he does not continue in the same way to sustain this
If the believers would maintain the attitude of the flesh being crucified Satan would have no way because the flesh is the workshop of Satan
If the 'flesh' not only a part of the flesh is really under the power of the Lord's death, then Satan will be unemployed
Since the believers in Galatia did not know this, they fell into the state of biting and devouring one another
They did not realize that as long as the flesh can serve God with its own ability and its own ideas, it can serve sin as well
At this time, it would be good for the believers to refresh their memory concerning God's verdict on the flesh
No matter how much the believers trust the flesh, God has said it is of no profit and does not help the spiritual life
If he is good, he sets up another righteousness apart from the Lord Jesus and loses the original purpose of the law
Man can think up many ways to do good deeds to improve and to advance but since these actions originate from the flesh God is not pleased
If he has accomplished something on his own, no matter how good and how effective the work is, God can never be pleased
Frequently, when the believers think that they are progressing spiritually, the Lord tries them in order that they may know themselves
It is after having gone through many years that the believers gradually realize the unreliability of their own flesh
Unless the believers have gone through many painful failures, they are always self-dependent and always think that they are capable
Because the believers cannot be rid of the influence of the flesh for a moment, self-judgment cannot cease for a moment
We ought to know that this kind of work of the Holy Spirit is as essential in the saints as it is in the sinners
May we have more of the conviction of the Holy Spirit so that we may forever place the flesh under judgment and may not let it take control
Whereas he had boasted in the past of the righteousness of the self, he now realized that it was nothing but dung and nothing but sin
Because the flesh is very subtle, the believers must moment by moment have the deeper work of the Holy Spirit through the cross
Once the believers see the standing of their own flesh before God, the cross and the deeper work of the Holy Spirit are indispensable
If one is faithful in submission, gradually he will experience more deeply what the cross has already accomplished
Not only the 'passions' and 'lusts' of the flesh have been 'crucified,' but 'the flesh' has also been 'crucified'
The flesh with its power and work may be excellent, but it can only manifest its capability in matters suitable to its own taste
If this life of the flesh has not undergone the work of the cross, it lives in the believers just as it lives in the sinners
The life of the flesh can become the vitality of the believers; they can draw strength from it to live on the earth
It can help the believers to have strength in serving God, in meditating on the truth, and in consecrating themselves for the work
Sometimes they completely depend on the power of the Spirit, while at other times they also have a heart of self-reliance
The believers should acknowledge that their flesh is qualified for nothing but to suffer the death of the curse
Once the believers see the value of the flesh as God sees it, they can have the experiential fellowship of the cross
Before the Holy Spirit can gain complete control in the believers, the flesh must be committed completely to the cross
May we let the Holy Spirit pierce deeply into our flesh with the cross of Christ so that the cross may become a real experience in our life!
If we are in union with Him in the likeness of death, we will also be in union with Him in the likeness of living
If the death of the flesh is not genuinely maintained, the resurrected and ascended life is merely a falsehood
We should never consider that we are already spiritual and advanced and that the flesh has no power to seduce us any more
The enemy wants us to leave the realm of the cross in order that we may become those who are outwardly spiritual but inwardly fleshly
It is while such ones are thinking that they are delivered from the flesh that they are being deceived by the flesh
If we live with a heart of faith and submission, then we can expect the Holy Spirit to do a most divine and marvelous work in us
Take this as the secret of Christ's life in us the Holy Spirit dwells in the deepest part of our being, our spirit
If we let the Spirit do a deeper work by the cross, then the circumcision which we have received will become more real day by day
For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh'
With this kind of trust and obedience, the flesh will be abased and kept in its position of curse and will lose its power
After you have gained a victory, do not consider that you are now safe, lest you give opportunity to the flesh and your fall become imminent
Right after the teaching of the crucifixion of the flesh and of walking in the Spirit, the apostle says, 'Let us not become vainglorious'
If we cover the weakness of the flesh before man because we want to receive glory, we will give the flesh an opportunity to work
Although there is much that you love to talk about, if you are not depending on the Spirit in speaking, you should not say anything
We should put to death what we think to be the best without any consideration, not for any other reason than because it is of ourselves
If, unfortunately, one fails, he must examine himself, confess his sin, and ask for the cleansing of the precious blood
It is not the work of the Holy Spirit alone nor that of the precious blood alone, but you yourselves also must do the work of cleansing
One should not only cleanse himself from his sinfulness but also cleanse himself from all the deeds of the flesh
He does not have to wait until he has been a believer for a period of time and has failed many times before he can receive this good news
For the sake of many, let us review what we have received through the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus
There must be the oppression from the power of sin, the inclination of the old man, and the carrying out of the body
When the Lord Jesus went to the cross, He not only brought our sin there, but also brought us, our beings, there
As the crucifixion of Christ is an accomplished fact, similarly the crucifixion of our old man is also an accomplished fact
We are shown without any ambiguity that we are crucified with Christ, and this co-crucifixion is an accomplished fact
The Spirit of God must give us a revelation so that we may know that we are in Christ and that we are in union with Him
Once a person has God's revelation, this truth spontaneously becomes powerful in him, and he also has the power to believe
Many people do not have the living faith but only have the mental understanding because they do not have God's revelation
Let us pray to God until He gives us a revelation so that we can truly say that we know that our old man has been crucified with Him
Formerly, when 'sin' instigated, our 'old man' responded to it, and consequently the 'body' carried out the committing of sins
The first is mentioned in verse 11: 'So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus'
The failure of many is that they want to feel, to see, and to experience, but they do not believe the Word of God
As long as we believe His Word and reckon that what He has done is real, His Holy Spirit will give us the experience
As long as we are not willing to give up something and if we have any resistance, it is still possible that sin might return to rule
Whenever we are defeated, we can definitely say that it is because we have failed either in our faith or in our obedience
We should learn to live by faith in Christ, never looking at ourselves, thinking about ourselves, or employing ourselves outside of Christ
Whatever God asks of me, no matter how difficult it is, no matter how much it is contrary to the flesh, my heart is always willing
The will, mind, and emotion of this life are active without any restraint, so that the experience of such a believer is still of the flesh
Unlike many philosophers, we do not think the flesh is intrinsically evil, but we admit that the body is the sphere where 'sin' rules
Before we reckon ourselves as dead to 'sin' and yield our body to God, 'sin' possesses our body, 'sin' is the master of our body
Because of this we see 'our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled'
For those who incline toward the will, the focus of their living is their own preference, and they are not willing to obey God's will
Those who incline toward the emotion seek pleasures in their feelings, considering this to be the supreme living
If sin reigns in the body, according to the temptation of sin the soul-life exercises its will to decide and to carry out what sin desires
Before the fall of man, it provided all its energy for the spirit's direction, but after the fall, it entirely follows the coercion of sin
Ever since man became flesh, this sin which reigns in the body has become the nature of man, enslaving the soul which is the life of man
As far as the inclination and desire of our living are concerned, it is according to sin that we conduct ourselves
His experience at this time is very changeable and also very painful, alternating between victories and defeats
It is because, even though the cross has worked and dealt with the sinful nature of the believer, the soul-life is still existing!
The defiled old man within the believer has become dead indeed, yet his soul is still the strength of his living
At this time the spiritual life is newborn and has not reached the stage of maturity to be able to express all the virtues of God's nature
Such deeds and works are the mingling of what is of God with what is of man, expressing the heavenly wishes by the earthly strength
Self, however, may not necessarily be filthy, may not necessarily oppose God, and may not necessarily be abominable
Although it is not sinful to labor in order to save people, to do it according to one's own ideas and methods is surely full of self
He does not know that although the old man has died to 'sin' and the body of 'sin' has been paralyzed, 'sin' has not died
Now 'sin' is a deposed monarch who will exhaust all his energy, seizing all the opportunities to regain his throne
Deliverance from sin is only the initial victory that God has given us in order that we may have more victories continually thereafter
He does not know that apart from sin there are two powers now within him: the power of the spirit and the power of the soul
Whether or not a believer is able to go on to become a spiritual man depends on how he deals with these two kinds of power within him
If he rejects the power of the soul and depends solely on the power of the spirit, he will succeed in becoming a spiritual man
By appropriating the power of the Holy Spirit, he lives on this earth not seeking his own will but the will of the Lord
The principle of his entire living is no longer controlled and influenced by his emotion; rather, it is to live quietly in his spirit
In his daily living he continues to make the soul his life and depends on the power of the self for everything
The believer must learn to know that overcoming sin is merely a general state of every believer and is not something extraordinary
A believer should proceed to learn the complete lesson which may be more difficult but which is always deeper to hate his own life
It is not only to forsake all sins but also, from God's point of view, to deliver up this sinful life to death
The life which is really in the Holy Spirit not only does not commit sin but also does not allow the self to live
We do not mean that the experience of a soulish believer is entirely of the soul, though believers of this type are many
They know in general the spiritual walk of life, and the Holy Spirit has enabled them to have a spiritual living
With some it is because of the lack of understanding, but with many it is because of their unwillingness, for they love their own soul-life
Whenever action is needed, he comes to God solely, fully conscious of his own impotence, to ask God to give him a promise
Because the spirit is surrounded by the soul, as if buried inside the soul, it is often influenced by the stimulus of the mind
When soulish believers hear the teaching of the dividing of spirit and soul, they want very much to know where their spirit is
Since many believers never have any real experience in the spirit, naturally they cannot distinguish their spirit from their soul
Before a believer's walk of life becomes completely spiritual, he will have the experience of a mixed spirit and soul as described above
If a believer carefully examines himself in the light of God, he will see that he has these two lives within him
Some can live entirely in the world of feelings and ideals; some live sometimes by their soul and at other times by their spirit
They study biblical prophecies to know the things of the future that they may have the ideal information to satisfy their curious mind
Having the error of some kind of self-deception, they think that whatever they understand mentally is what they have experienced
Soulish believers often have an attitude of self-righteousness, though sometimes it cannot be detected easily from the outside
We should hold fast to the major truths recorded in the Bible, but we certainly can let others have the liberty concerning minor points
The mind of soulish believers is often disturbed by evil spirits so that their thoughts become confused, mixed up, and sometimes defiled
Sometimes they are extremely happy and stirred in their emotion, as if a fire were burning or a treasure had been found
Sometimes when their heart is not burning, they suddenly have a feeling of loss and become dejected and unhappy
They readily suspect that others' attitude toward them has changed; thus they become sorrowful, sad, and resentful
People, things, and affairs in the world often invade their inner man, causing them to lose the peace in their spirit
If you place a soulish believer in a joyful environment he will be joyful but if you place him in a difficult situation he will be sorrowful
When they have such a feeling, they think that they have reached the supreme state and have made great strides on the way to spirituality
They think that when they have such a feeling, their spiritual condition is at the highest point; otherwise, they think it is at the lowest
It is not that they have not considered what to speak but rather that once they speak they cannot restrain themselves
When other people talk too much, they realize that it is inappropriate, and they criticize secretly in their heart
They also like to hum and intone as if by reciting some poems they have the marvelous feeling of transcending the worldly
Very often they have the thought of escaping from the world and living in seclusion because they see the worsening condition of the world
Most soulish believers have a great deal of spiritual knowledge, but their experiences can never match what they know
They receive grace to have knowledge, but unlike spiritual believers, they do not receive grace to have humility
To those who are closely associated with them, they give the impression of having a certain 'stiffness,' a hard shell
They are not like spiritual believers whose outer shell has been broken so that they are approachable and kind to others
They are not yet like their more spiritual brothers who gladly accept what God has arranged for them, whether exaltation or rejection
Little do they know that if they have obtained God's grace, it is easier for them to have a spiritual walk in life than zealous believers
They cannot ignore their feelings and talk to the Samaritan woman with an empty stomach or speak to Nicodemus with weary eyes
Drawn about with much serving' and 'troubled' in heart are the characteristics of the works of every soulish believer
It is very easy for soulish believers to find shortcomings in others although they are not necessarily stronger than others
When they investigate and correct the shortcomings in others, they often have a sense of self-satisfaction, exaltation, and pride
Sometimes when they help people, what they do may be good and legitimate, but often their motive is not proper
Since soulish believers lack real spiritual insight, their actions unconsciously follow the direction of the 'sudden thoughts' of their mind
Because they themselves presume that there 'ought' to be such a need in people, they utter useless words in trying to help others
They rely either on their own illustrations, interpretations, and clever ideas or on their own persuasive power
When they see anything wrong in others or are told of some difficulty, they pretend to be experienced believers trying to help
When they are helping others, they always pour forth everything which has been stored in their mind and exhibit one thing after another
Even when there is a tremendous need, when they should speak to help others, they keep their mouth tightly closed
They can sit beside those talkative believers and criticize them in their heart, but their tacitness is not in any way less soulish
Because soulish believers have not been deeply rooted in God and have not learned how to be hidden in God, they are often visible
While working, they use spiritual words as the material for their speaking, although perhaps without their heart
If they become so happy and boast to such an extent when ten persons are saved, what will happen if a thousand persons are saved?
After some successful work in their preaching, soulish believers always have a thought that they are very wonderful
They think that others treat them in this way simply because they are without eyes to recognize that they are the prophets from Nazareth
Under such a condition they often think that soon the church of God will see a great evangelist, revivalist, or writer in them
Since they have many gifts, good thoughts, and rich emotions, they can easily arouse people's interest and stir their heart
What people see is what they 'have,' and it stops there in them so that they cannot cause others to receive spiritual life
If the children of God are willing to apply God's light to illuminate themselves, their spiritual life will not be as it is today
The seeking of the mind and its receiving and spreading of truth are the main manifestations of one's being soulish
When his emotion is cooled down, even though his feelings may become cooler, he is still very bewildered in his mind and in his will
When we see an ambitious child having high self-esteem and being boastful and self- exalted, we feel shameful for him
As he is fervently doing work for God, even though he does not depend on God's power, he thinks he is doing God's work
They have not yet received the personal revelation from the Holy Spirit that can make them aware of the evil of their natural life
To do this, one must be honest, humble, and willing to eliminate what the Holy Spirit enlightens him to eliminate
Although he has many gifts, he simply uses these gifts and never cares for the will of the Lord who gave him the gifts
When the Holy Spirit shines on a believer with light for the first time he repents in the light and is willing to put the soullife to death
We should have a heart without fear to let the Holy Spirit expose all the pitiful places of our soul-life one by one
We should by faith trust God's appraisal of our life and be willing to wait for the Holy Spirit to reveal our life to us through the Word
When believers have not reached or are not willing to reach what God wants them to reach, they are inevitably in danger
Only in this way will he then be able to understand God's will, work with the Holy Spirit, and overcome all the schemes of the enemy
Many believers do not understand the work of the spirit and cannot distinguish between what is spiritual and what is soulish
Consequently, they greatly utilize much soulish ability to live and work, and even suppress the life of the spirit
When a believer lives in the soul, he always walks according to the thoughts, imaginations, plans, and visions of his mind
The spirit will be unable to work to make the believer obtain ability and guidance to fight the battle and to worship
Many of the things we see in Galatians 5 as 'works of the flesh' are naturally the lusts which issue out of man's body
If the life of the old creation continues to exist in the believer he will join together with the nature of the old creation before too long
The flesh' is the factory of the devil, but the work of Satan on the soul is no less than his work in the body
A believer may only know that the enemy can tempt man to sin but may not know that he can also give thoughts to man
The enemy troubles the believer again and again and confuses the believer, letting him, although having hated sins, still love his own life
What we would now emphasize is that the believer was saved to be delivered not only from his sins, but also from his natural life
If a believer is delivered from the power of sin and the soul-life, layer by layer, the work of the enemy will be a great failure
He can easily put misunderstanding and prejudice into mans mind unconsciously causing man to have doubts toward Gods truth and mans honesty
The emotion part of the soul-life of a believer is also very likely to be pushed by the enemy into doing his work
All this renders the small voice of the Holy Spirit and the delicate function of the intuition of man's spirit suppressed and unable to work
In Revelation 12:11 we see that not loving the soul-life even unto death is one of the great conditions for overcoming the devil
Because a soldier of Christ often has a kind of sympathizing and caring for himself and has a deep love of his own life he loses the victory
If the enemy can cause a believer's heart to be filled with anxiety for himself, the enemy will always be victorious
No matter how much a believer understands the truth or how zealous he is in warfare, the soul is always the dangerous spot
The worst thing is that when a believer becomes more spiritual, his soulish portion becomes much harder to detect
Here we must give a warning that in God's ordination we should reject all things we have received from Adam our life and our nature
In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus at least four times called His disciples to renounce their soul-life, to put it to death, to follow Him
Although the Lord Jesus spoke about the soul-life in all these four callings, He had a special emphasis in each
In Matthew 10:38 and 39 the Lord Jesus said, 'And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me
These verses call us to lose our soul-life for the Lord's sake, to hand this life over to the cross to be dealt with
Because God's will is at variance with the intention of our household, we must for the Lord's sake become estranged from our dearest ones
He said in verse 37 He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me
Matthew shows the believer the choice he should make concerning his own affection: he should love the Lord more than his household
Luke shows the attitude the believer should hold toward the love originating from his own soul-life: he should hate it
It is thus by putting the soul to death being willing to die that the believers are able to break away from the soul's power
We need to take note that this soul-life, humanly speaking, is legitimate and natural to possess; it is not filthy like sins
The Lord's calling is for us to overcome the natural and, for God's sake, to renounce even man's legitimate right and be blended with God
Although the soul-life was given to man by the Lord of creation, God desires that men not live according to this life
Those who know the heart of God do not want to stop at God's natural gifts; rather, they desire to rest in the God who gives the gift
Christians are very willing to leave the Ur of Chaldea, but they seldom see the importance of offering on Mount Moriah what God has given
What our Lord wants is very meaningful because man's affection is a function which is very difficult to control
When the faculty of affection is stimulated, the whole being of the believer very easily loses its spiritual normality
If the Lord cannot have the first place in the matter of affection, it is hard for Him to take charge in other things
Not only must we hate what we love, but we must also hate that faculty from which the love issues, that is, our soul-life
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
Because Peter was setting his mind on the things of man, he was reluctant to see his Master bear any suffering of the cross in the flesh
Peter asked the Lord why He would not be 'merciful' to Himself, but the Lord's reply was that one should 'deny himself'
Every time we are willing to choose the narrow way of the cross to suffer for Christ's sake, the soul-life suffers loss
If we pay attention to the situation of the foregoing passage, we will understand the wickedness of the work of the soul-life
Peter spoke this word shortly after he had received the revelation of God, thereby understanding the mystery which man cannot understand
God the Father had personally revealed to him that the lowly Jesus whom the disciples followed was the very Christ of the living God
We should know that spiritual revelation or wonderful knowledge cannot insure that we will not be controlled by the soul
The soul-life of those with higher knowledge and more experiences might be more hidden than others and more difficult to eliminate
Without applying the cross to deal with the soul-life, the soul-life will always be preserved in man without being lost
His heart was not bad, and his intention was very good, but this was merely his 'human affection' which issued out of his soul-life
We see that there is a possibility of being soulish in serving, adoring, and expressing our love toward the Lord
We also see that the soul-life is not acceptable even in the matter of loving the Lord and sympathizing with the Lord
Although such an expression of Peter's love was for the Lord, such love for the Lord was a manifestation of how Peter himself was
Every breaking of the intention of the soul is a practical application of the dealing of the cross to the soul-life
He is not afraid for man to pray and love the Lord, but he is afraid that man would not use his own soul-life to love the Lord and pray
Believers should not consider that they are spiritual just because they now love the Lord and long for the heavenly things
The Lord's calling is that we should deny the self and take up our own cross, thereby causing us to lose our soul-life
We should have a heart disregarding our self, and through the power of God we should give up our life for others' sake
We should note carefully that what the Lord Jesus says here is not something which can be accomplished once for all by making a great effort
Rather, it requires that we daily bear our own cross through the power of the Lord's cross, determining to deny the self until it is lost
In Luke 17:32-33 our Lord has a similar word, but what is pointed out there is concerning the things of the world: 'Remember Lot's wife
With a believer who is consecrated to the Lord, there is no need for him to regress and go back again to the path of the world
When the soul-life really reaches the point that it is lost, none of the things of the world can truly touch the believer's heart
A believer who has lost his soul-life can spontaneously and without any pretense give away his cloak when he is sued for his tunic
In this world, it is not by how much we have gained that we are counted rich, for actually, the richer we are, the more we lose
If our hearts have not been cut off from loving the worldly belongings, our soul-life has not yet been under the working of the cross
Hebrews 10:34 says that certain believers were robbed of their family possessions, but this they 'accepted with joy'
In the beginning he 'counted as loss' all things; later he truly 'suffered the loss of all things' that he might gain Christ
Their spirits will be separated from all things worldly and will be enabled to live in God without any hindrances
He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life'
Although His work was very prosperous outwardly, He knew that if He did not die, He could not give life to man
All talents, gifts, knowledge, wisdom, and power that issue from the soul-life are unable to cause the believers to produce many grains
Just as the Lord Jesus had to die in order that He could bear fruit, so also the believers must die that they may be able to bear fruit
The Lord indicated that although the power of the soul-life is good, it is useless in God's fruit-bearing work
How could those who are unwilling to deny the soullife and watch and pray in such a way guard themselves from being intruded by the soullife
When we die and can neither see nor feel anything, God not ourselves will be able to use the soul-life to impart His life to us
The Holy Spirit, through the transcendent life of God, is afforded the opportunity to be the life of these faculties
Putting the soul-life to death does not mean that henceforth our mind, emotion, and will are completely abolished and become emptiness
When He was in the garden of Gethsemane, He 'offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears'
The faculties of the soul do not vanish, nor does the believer become a sensationless, unsympathetic, and icy, cold person
The soul in the sense of the faculty of the soul still exists; but the soul in the sense of the life of the soul must be denied completely
Only this can enable the Holy Spirit alone to use each faculty of the soul without any interference of the natural life
His death only caused Him to be free from the soul-life and caused His life, the life of God's Spirit, to be manifested greater and brighter
If a man without God's life is dead, although his spirit remains forever, he cannot resurrect in eternal life as the Lord did
Only the Holy Spirit can reveal to us how indispensable resurrection is and thereby cause us to know how indispensable death is also
What a God-seeking believer should fear the most is the activity of the soul beyond the limitation set up by God
The calling of the cross of the Lord Jesus is for us to hate our soul-life so that we find the opportunity to lose it and not preserve it
The Lord's intention is that the self must and should be sacrificed and offered up completely so that the Holy Spirit may work
, of the soul-life to the cross and maintain a steady attitude of hating the soul-life, it will seize the chance to rise up
If the soul-life is not lost through death but is allowed to be mixed with the spirit, the believers will continue to fail just as before
Sometimes it is the extra activities of the mind that cause the quiet spiritual life to be affected and become disorderly
The mind, will, and emotion of the soul oftentimes rebel against the spirit by not obeying the command of the spirit
The dividing of the soul from the spirit is not merely a doctrine; the believer must have and can have such an experience in life
The willingness of a believer to cooperate causes him experientially to have a pure spiritual life without being affected by the soul
In Hebrews 4, the Holy Spirit tells us of the function of the Lord Jesus as a High Priest toward the believers
The Bible speaks of how the Lord Jesus is carrying out His work as the High Priest for the spirit and soul of the believers
All the insides that were hidden, which could not be seen or known before, were opened up and laid bare without concealment
Each has its own place, and one can distinguish what is from the soul and what is from the spirit without any confusion or mixture
If a believer wants to have a steady life in God, he needs to understand what is the meaning of piercing into the spirit
The dividing of soul and spirit is not only the separating of soul and spirit, but the dividing of the soul itself
If the word of life is to reach to our spirit, it has to divide the soul first, for the spirit is surrounded by the soul
The sacrifice has to be laid upon the altar; then the priest can use the knife to divide the sacrifice into two halves
Only then can they expect the Lord Jesus to fulfill His duty as the High Priest to divide the soul and spirit of the believers with His word
Believers should fulfill the condition of their side and trust the rest of the experience to the hands of their faithful High Priest
If we do not put ourselves on the altar, our High Priest has no way to divide our soul and spirit with His sharp knife
If a believer is willing to gain the experience of the dividing of spirit and soul, he should put himself wholly on the altar of the cross
He should maintain the attitude that until the dividing work is done, he does not want the High Priest to stop working
Believers must be careful not to fall into sins and trespasses while seeking the experience of the dividing of spirit and soul
If the Lord is to divide our spirit and soul, He will, according to the need of circumstances, allow us to bear the cross
Walking by the Spirit is a condition that safeguards us and is also the condition in which to have our spirit and soul completely divided
If we have truly given ourselves to the cross, our High Priest will surely fulfill His duty to divide our spirit and soul
Once He sees that we have fulfilled the necessary requirements for Him to work, in due time He will surely divide our spirit and soul
It is not that since you have prayed and asked the Holy Spirit to work and guide, everything is all right and will be accomplished
Are we willing to seek His life to fill our spirit, in order to deal with the soul so that it cannot be active?
If we are willing to come into a completely spiritual living, we absolutely have to submit to the Lord and to all His teachings in the Bible
When the time came, the Lord Jesus' body the reality of the veil was crucified on the cross, so that the veil was split from top to bottom
It is the work of the cross that causes the real veil of the holy temple, both in heaven and on earth, to be split
Finally, this will cause what we previously kept in the spirit through faith, to be known now even in our soul
The priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's house'
Concerning the aspect of the soul affecting and controlling the spirit, the work of the cross is to divide the soul from the spirit
Once we were full of our own ideas, having many desires and ambitions; now we only consider the will of God to be good and thus rest in God
Now, through the working of the cross, the soul-life that formerly rebelled against the will of God completely surrenders to the will of God
Now what we seek first is the kingdom of God and His righteousness, believing that God will take care of our daily needs
The soul-life has been dealt with through the cross by the Holy Spirit, so it can no longer be anxious for itself
Previously, miracles were rare and strange to us; now we live in the God who performs miracles, knowing He will provide every need
Since the power of God serves as our backing, questions concerning our daily life such as eating and drinking become very insignificant
So then let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator'
To speak of Him as the Lord of creation is to make His power known, to make known how the whole universe is under His hand
Before, when we were suffering, we were afraid of man, but now we know that everything is in His hand and has His arrangement
Now we know that everything in the universe, whether of man, the natural, or supernatural, is in His careful and wise arrangement
Now we no longer dare to have faith in ourselves, to be independent, or to serve the Lord according to the whims of the soul
Now he no longer wants to steal the Lord's glory and give it to the self , but he magnifies the Lord in his soul
Only this kind of person considers his life of no account as if precious , but lays down his life for the brothers
If the heart of loving oneself is not lost, then when the Lord calls us in reality to bear the cross for Him, we will shrink back
Because the soul-life is specifically rejected daily, one can, for the sake of the Lord, consider his life 'of no account as if precious'
The way His soul felt about the shame despising it and enduring the cross is the goal for those of us willing to tread the path of the cross
Only in this way will a believer be able to know how to walk according to the spirit, not according to the fleshly soul or body
Naturally, he restricts the life of the spirit and lets the natural life of the soul continue to act as the principle of his living
After they have the experience of overcoming sins, they no longer go forward because they do not know the work of the spirit
He subjectively thinks that his experience is spiritually solid, which will keep him from progressing in the spiritual path
He fell, became the leader of the authority of darkness, and was separated from God and all the virtues of God
Only God's Son, who shed His blood to cleanse us from our sin and give us a new life, can bring us back to God
All God's work begins within man, from center to circumference, unlike Satan who works from the outside to the inside
Regeneration causes man to receive a new spirit on one hand and, on the other hand, causes his old spirit to be resurrected
The spirit which man originally had, although it has been enlivened, may still be defiled and needs to be sanctified
When God's life enters into our human spirit, it enlivens our spirit which was in a state like a drunken stupor
What we lost in Adam was the spirit which died; what we receive at regeneration is this dead spirit which has been enlivened
We not only obtain what we had lost in Adam, we also receive a new spirit with God's life which Adam never had
As a result of seeing this, we understand the vanity of self-improvement, exhortations to do good, revival, repentance, etc
And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
While the cross has already accomplished everything, the Holy Spirit accomplishes within man what has been accomplished before
Although salvation is entirely accomplished by the cross, it is the Holy Spirit who works directly to cause people to receive
If man merely understands in his mentality and there is no Holy Spirit to regenerate him within his spirit his understanding cannot help him
In addition to enabling believers to receive life at the time of regeneration, the Holy Spirit has another step of work
A believer receives at the time of regeneration, not only a new spirit, but also the Holy Spirit dwelling within him
Regeneration is absolutely necessary because without it the Holy Spirit cannot possibly abide within believers
At regeneration, a believer receives a new spirit and, at the same time, receives the Holy Spirit to abide in him forever
Since the new spirit and God, who begot it, are eternally inseparable, the abiding of the Holy Spirit is also forever unchangeable
The Holy Spirit's indwelling of the believers to manifest the Father and the Son is a special glory in the dispensation of grace
The day of resurrection and the day of Pentecost are both over; the descension of the Holy Spirit has been accomplished
Very often a believer does not even know the position of the Holy Spirit, despises His indwelling, and walks according to his own will
If we want to abide in Christ and have a holy life as Christ's, we should use our faith to receive God's provision
The most important point is that when we receive a new spirit, we also receive the Holy Spirit of God to dwell within us
The phrase 'put within you' occurs twice in Ezekiel 36:26-27 and indicates that the place where the Holy Spirit dwells is the human spirit
The Holy Place and outer court are only places for God to work and move according to His presence in the Holy of Holies
After mans regeneration only mans regenerated spirit is an adequate dwelling place of the Holy Spirit not his mind emotion will and body
We have also mentioned that everything of man before his regeneration regardless of which part in its totality is called flesh in the Bible
Not to mention that the Holy Spirit cannot dwell in any part of man's soul or body, He cannot dwell even in man's unregenerated spirit
Just as the holy ointment cannot be poured upon the flesh, in the same way, the Holy Spirit cannot dwell in any part of the 'flesh'
The regeneration of the spirit is very important because the Holy Spirit dwells in the new spirit, which is different from the flesh
Only the effect produced by the work of the Holy Spirit in man's spirit can be counted as a spiritual experience
Romans 8:16 says, 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit' not the heart or the soul 'that we are children of God'
Our spirit is a regenerated and renewed spirit, and He who dwells in, yet is distinct from, our spirit is the Holy Spirit
Later on he pointed out the mistake of considering the word Spirit as the Holy Spirit without regard to the context
In the original text there is no indication that it refers to the Holy Spirit or human spirit whenever just the word Spirit is used
After seeing the above we know that the Holy Spirit and the believers regenerated spirit have a relation which is very difficult to separate
The part of man which can work with the Holy Spirit is his spirit, and the part of man where the Holy Spirit can work is also his spirit
There is a specific path that a regenerated believer should specifically take in order to succeed in becoming spiritual
Once a man believes in Christ, he becomes a regenerated believer; once he obeys the Holy Spirit, he becomes a spiritual believer
The Holy Spirit, on the positive side, carries out a constructive work, building up everything that is from Christ
Paying attention to these steps does not necessarily mean proceeding from step one to step two and from step two to step three
For the sake of writing, however, they have to be written in sequence, although in actual experience they often occur simultaneously
If a believer can assume the final attitude that he should have toward the flesh, then he will progress easily
If we do not pay attention to the flesh, no matter what kind of progress there may be, it will all be vain, superficial, and unreal
When a believer knows how to deny the flesh and its activities, abilities, and opinions in all things, we can say that this man is spiritual
The soul and the spirit must be clearly divided, like the Lord Jesus whose spirit and soul are not mixed at all
The work of the cross on the soul-life must be very real, and the restriction imposed by the cross on the soul-life very definite
A believer must have experiences of the soul and the spirit being divided to the point where the spirit is no longer surrounded by the soul
The dividing of the soul and spirit is an indispensable work on the negative side in order for a believer to enter into spiritual life
Without this, the believer will always be influenced by the soul, and the spirit and the soul will often be mixed in his living
Sometimes he has a spiritual living, but sometimes he is governed by the mind and emotion, or he may even live by the natural life
Even when it is the object of the soulish love or emotion of others, it will be annoyed as if it cannot bear with them
Only when the dividing of the believer's spirit and soul becomes very real will he have clean feelings and intentions that are genuine
Only then will he know that not only are sinful things defiling, but everything natural is defiling and should be rejected as well
The resurrected Lord is the life-giving Spirit ; therefore, His union with the believers is His union with the believers' spirit
In the believers' soul there is nothing that matches the nature of the Lord's life; only the spirit can have such union
Just as the Spirit of the Lord is pure and without a trace of mixture our spirit should also be pure so there can be a real and actual union
For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection'
We accept His death as our death and the joining with Him in death as the beginning of our being joined to Him
If we accept this way by faith, we will experientially stand together with Him in the position of resurrection
The goal and result of the work of the cross is that a believer's spirit would be joined to the resurrected Lord as one spirit
The cross must work deeply on the negative, destructive side to make the believer lose everything sinful and natural
His spirit is full of life and nothing can limit this life because his spirit is closely joined to the life-giving Spirit
Such a union causes the believer to gain the Lord's life and nature and builds up the Lord's new creation in him
By joining to the Lord as one spirit, the believer's spirit is no longer hindered by anything, and it can no longer be disturbed by anything
The believer must know by faith, know entirely, know clearly, and know constantly that the Holy Spirit indeed indwells him
The believer should not only know the doctrines in the Bible that speak about the Holy Spirit; he should know the Holy Spirit Himself
The apostle asked the Corinthian believers saying Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you
He considered the indwelling of the Holy Spirit to be the very first result of salvation, yet they did not know this!
The Lord Jesus took the likeness of sinful flesh, and the Holy Spirit dwells inside the likeness of sinful flesh
The prayer of the apostle is for the spirit of the believer to be strengthened by the Holy Spirit so that it can become strong
Whether a believer's spirit is strong depends on whether or not he has specially been given power by the Holy Spirit
What the apostle prayed for on their behalf surely must have been a gift other than the Holy Spirit dwelling in them
He will pray for the Holy Spirit to fill his spirit with power; being filled with power in the spirit is the need of the believer
Sometimes when a believer is preaching and working on someone, it seems as though he is unable to do anything and has no way to manage him
Those whose spirits are weak will find it difficult to petition God for several years or several decades without being tired and discouraged
Only those with a strong spirit have the energy to go forward continuously without regard to the environment or feelings
Only those who really have power in the spirit will know how to exercise the power of the spirit to resist and attack the enemy
In order for the believer to receive this power of the Holy Spirit, some works must be accomplished on his side
The believer does not need to wait for the Holy Spirit to come and fill him, because the Holy Spirit has descended long ago
The believer only has to wait for the cross to work deeply enough within him to fulfill the necessary condition for the Holy Spirits filling
A believer must be careful never to regard his faith as an excuse for not needing the inward strengthening of the Holy Spirit
Once he has had the new experience of being strengthened in the spirit, his spirit's intuition becomes clearly manifest
Consequently, many believers will more easily know the intuition of their own spirit because their inner man has become strong
A spirit that is full of the power of the Holy Spirit can control the soul and body and make them completely submissive
Regardless of whether it is thought, desire, feeling, or intention, everything must be controlled by the spirit
Whenever he has a chance, he will cause the believer to lose his high position and be brought down to a low living
It is very important for a believer to always be watchful and walk according to the spirit; then he can always be spiritual
We should know that while we live on this earth, we do not live according to our good feelings, doing whatever we feel we should do
Neither should we live according to the good thoughts in our mind, either suddenly or constantly, doing whatever we think
Sometimes our spirit has consciousness but we do not know what it means, what it demands, and what it expresses
We have already seen that all of the good behavior of the flesh is independent of God, rather than dependent on God
The feeling of the soul is always to demand grasp and desire everything that can be seen and felt as a guarantee in order to act and behave
Walking according to the spirit has two parts: one is to begin working and the other is to do this work with power
He must forsake all thoughts, cleverness, knowledge, capabilities, and gifts; he must completely depend on the Lord
Not walking according to thoughts, ideas, feelings, and tendencies, but only according to the intuition, will cause us to begin well
Not depending on our own talents, power, and abilities, but only on the power of the spirit, will cause us to continue to be perfected
A 'spiritual man' is not a person who only has a spirit, with no soul and no body; in that case he would be a spirit and not a man
The spiritual man does have an emotion, mind, and will, but they are completely subject to the guidance of the intuition of the spirit
The spiritual man has an emotion but his emotion does not act independently as it once did it is completely under the control of the spirit
Now it only likes what the spirit likes, only loves what the spirit chooses, and only feels what the spirit allows
It is completely broken; it no longer resists God, no longer works against God, and no longer is wild and difficult to harness
His mind, imagination, feeling, ideals, love, and opinion have all been renewed and cleansed by the Holy Spirit
His whole person is ruled by the spirit, and all the faculties of his person are completely under the spirit and regulated by it
If he is asked to live completely for God and God's work, regardless of his own happiness and feeling, he will shrink and not go on
God's intention, from the beginning to the end, is not that the believers' spirit should become a pool of spiritual life
The secret of living a spiritual life is to let life flow out without interruption and reach the lives of others
When a believer does not care for himself, but only minds the Father's business, he will see that he is always full and satisfied
What he really needs is to guard what he has gained so that it will not be lost, because what has not been lost has been gained
When a believer lets the life in his spirit flow everywhere, he not only gains other people, but he also gains himself
The spiritual believer knows his place in the Body of Christ; therefore, he also knows the sphere of his own work
Retaining the spiritual life is the unique way to lose it, but working recklessly also hinders the release of spiritual life
How many hope to receive power which would enable people to fall before them, saving them the labor of searching and fighting?
Regardless of whether it is the most filthy or the most cultured flesh, the Holy Spirit of God cannot descend upon it
A believer may not want the flesh to die, but may instead want to receive the Holy Spirit to adorn it and provide more power to work for God
All believers with spiritual insight, who have arrived at the other side of the veil, know that such successes have no spiritual value
When a believer has condemned his flesh and walks according to the spirit, he can truly receive the power of the Holy Spirit
Whether his work is effective depends on whether or not the believer has the experience of being baptized in the Holy Spirit
Some are hindered by sin, some are proud, some are cold, some are filled with their own opinion, and some trust in the soul-life
We must let God remove from our lives, one by one, everything that belongs to sin and everything that is unrighteous and doubtful
After a believer receives the power of the Holy Spirit, he will have a clear feeling concerning the senses of his spirit
In the work of God, a believer must keep his spirit free to allow the Holy Spirit to flow out His life after he receives power
Depending on the response of the congregation to free the leader of the meeting from his spiritual burden will result in failure
The leader of the meeting must first release them by means of prayers, hymns, or the truth before he gives the message of God
If the leader of the meeting has a burden from which he cannot be freed, how can he hope that others would be free?
In working, especially with regard to an individual, there is sometimes the experience of the spirit's being closed
In Acts we do not see someone consecrating to be a preacher deciding to do the Lords work becoming a missionary or becoming a pastor etc
At that time the work of the apostles was nothing other than knowing the mind of the Holy Spirit in their intuition and then following it
God has never given believers the authority to control the work; He only wants them to listen to what He says in their spirit
The Jewish rule prohibited Jews from going to a Gentile home to associate with them, but when the Holy Spirit spoke, Peter could not resist
Overstretching in the work will prevent us from walking according to the spirit and from doing real spiritual work
We should know that these things are good servants, but they are not good masters; if we follow them, we will fail
When people need spiritual help, the worker should never allow soulish feelings to overcome the spiritual relationship
We should work only when we know in the intuition that the work is according to the leading of the Holy Spirit
Superficial accomplishments matter little; only the work that is done by God, through men and women who have been crucified, matters
We should realize that even in the matter of serving God, there is the possibility of offering 'strange fire' and of being 'not spiritual'
All of the fire that is not kindled in our spirit by the Holy Spirit is strange fire and sin in the eyes of God
The goal of spiritual work is nothing other than the spirit of man receiving life and building up the spirit which has life
Believers do not need more knowledge of the Bible; rather, they need something which can feed their spiritual life
After so much effort, we still allow the person upon whom we have worked to go away just as he came with a dead spirit
A sinner does not need better reasonings, more tears, or a firmer resolve; he needs the resurrection of the spirit
A believer does not need the building up of the outward man; he needs the more abundant life which can make his spirit grow
If the spirit has not resurrected so that he can know God in the intuition, none of the work will have any spiritual result
Many have put the blood of the Lamb in the container but have not applied this blood on the door of their heart
They are very clean pious and willing to help others they know how to pray often read the Bible often come to meetings and are very loving!
Since the relationship between man and God begins at regeneration and is all in the spirit, all our works should focus on this point
Rather than working aimlessly, following what we think is good, we should have a clear goal to build up the spirit of man
We must ask God to reveal this to us, to let us know the nature of His great work and that we need His great power in order to do His work
We will realize that our opinions are truly foolish and our self-reliance is truly laughable; all our works are nothing but 'dead works'
Although counterfeit spiritual power may produce similar results, the dead spirit of man can never genuinely receive life from it
The one who depends on the power of the spirit may use the same words, but these words will become life to the spirit
The work that is done by utilizing the power of the soul will cause these people to demand these feelings and ideals more and more
Someone who has spiritual knowledge will realize that they have no life in their spirit, because their spirit still cannot move
After all the speaking, the audience does not receive the Lord as their Savior so that their dead spirit can be made alive
If we understand that our goal is to let the spirit of others receive life, then we ourselves must have considerable preparation
If we really lose our soul and depend on the spirit we will see that the words which the Lord speaks from our mouths are spirit and are life
Spiritual work often flows with the current of the Holy Spirit without any constraint and without the need for the strength of the flesh
When a believer's work is needed by God, he will feel the flow of the Holy Spirit no matter what kind of difficulty
Many of God's servants who are urged by the environment unconsciously let the work they are doing become mechanical
The servants of the Lord must know that what is begun as a spiritual work a work of the Holy Spirit may not always continue to be spiritual
When spiritual work needs to stop and the believer does not stop, he has to use his soulish strength and physical strength to work
A work which is not led by the Holy Spirit will fail immediately unless the believer exercises his mental power, natural ability, gift, etc
The responsibility of a believer is to fix his sight on the 'flow' of the Holy Spirit and then follow that flow
Today among spiritual works there is a distressing situation in which the worker considers his work to be a heavy burden
If the work becomes a tiresome thing, separating the life of the spirit from the Lord Jesus, then this work must be stopped immediately
If the flesh has never been dealt with by the cross to the extent that a man becomes a 'vacuum,' what use and purpose does his prayer have?
Any prayer that is not initiated and inspired by the intuition is a prayer that originates from the believers themselves and is of the flesh
We must acknowledge our own weakness and powerlessness before we can utter His prayer through the operation of the Holy Spirit in our spirit
Even a spiritual person may not necessarily pray a spiritual prayer because if he is not watchful, he will fall into the flesh
If a spiritual person continually prays in spirit, his prayer will maintain his spirit and mind in a state of harmony with God
Whoever fights the enemy on their knees will find the enemy defeated when they rise up to meet him face to face
Believers should quickly realize any move in their spirit so that they can accomplish in prayer what God wants them to accomplish
When a believer passes through the baptism of the Holy Spirit, he comes in contact with God's supernatural power and touches a personal God
The power of darkness will disguise itself as an angel of light and imitate the person and work of the Holy Spirit
If a believer has not reached this spiritual state, he will neither understand nor be able to engage in such a warfare in the spirit
He understands the way to 'wrestle' with the enemy with his spirit only when the Holy Spirit strengthens the power of his spirit
When we are for God, we fight against Satan with our spiritual strength, destroy his schemes, and work with the words of our prayer
Although at times we do not know what he is scheming or doing, we fight against him anyway because he is always our enemy
If he does not understand the leading of the spirit and remains in a passive position, he will become a prisoner of the enemy
If a believer thinks that his spirit can only be directed by the Holy Spirit and not be affected by evil spirits, he is very wrong
Unless a believer closes his spirit to reject them evil spirits will take hold of his spirit through deceptions disguises and counterfeits
They should study their experiences and find out if these experiences come from the outward senses or the spirit within
If a believer is willing to humble himself and acknowledge the possibility of being deceived, he will save himself from many deceptions
If he walks according to the spirit, he will learn to work by praying unceasingly in his spirit and opposing the enemy in this way
Once the spirit becomes weak, there will be fear, and believers will not be able to withstand in the evil days
If believers do not understand the nature of the warfare, they will not be able to withstand in their spirit the principalities and powers
His aim is to take away the believers' position in ascension and to suppress their spirit in order that he can ascend
If believers realize the wiles of the enemy, do not draw back in anything, and withstand him, their emotions will be protected
Other than being bound by sin and self-righteousness, the most common bondage for believers relates to supernatural experiences
The present need is to have a group of overcoming believers who know how to fight and deliver others from the deception of the enemy
While he is fleshly he encounters danger and conflict in the realm of the flesh while spiritual he encounters spiritual danger and warfare
Any supernatural feeling and undue awareness of the natural affairs in the body need to be carefully distinguished
We have mentioned that all the guidance we have comes from our spirit and that we must wait for the leading of the Spirit in our spirit
We need not be afraid of going to the extreme in obeying the Lord or in rejecting the works of the flesh, which we must put away thoroughly
We have stressed the point that whatever belongs to man and comes out of man is vanity and that we should seek only after God's own work
When a believer is unable to use his own spirit and needs a power from without to 'move' his spirit, Satan will take full advantage of him
Only spiritual believers, not fleshly ones, have the danger of passivity in the spirit and counterfeit experiences of the spirit, etc
When they are about to experience this baptism, they consider any supernatural experience to be the baptism in the Holy Spirit
Rather, they plunge into a passive state, giving up their own will and allowing a power from without to burn, twist, and cast them down
Satan begins to give them extremely happy feelings with numerous visions, dreams, and other supernatural experiences
He thinks the Holy Spirit will no longer lead him through his conscience or through the judgment of the intuition
By not using his conscience and letting it slip into a passive state, he is defrauded in his daily living by the enemy
They stop using their intuition to sense the will of the Holy Spirit; neither do they use their conscience to distinguish right and wrong
They simply act as machines, following outward, superficial voices which they have mistaken for the voice of God
In such a life of spiritual warfare, we must keep our spirit in an active state fully obedient to the Holy Spirit, not in a passive state
In reality it is just the opposite; the spiritual life does not provide any happiness to him; rather, it is a life of daily fighting
If you try to separate spiritual warfare from spiritual life, you will soon find out that that life is no longer spiritual
A spiritual life is one of suffering, charged with vigilance, labor, fatigue, sufferings, heartbreak, and conflict
A spiritual life in the eyes of God is one with spiritual usefulness because it is a life of attacking God's enemy for Him
We should stir up our zeal for Him and war against the enemy constantly, never allowing our spirit, which is so useful, to become passive
If we want to understand more clearly about spiritual life, we have to analyze the spirit thoroughly and understand all of its laws
Only after we have understood every function of the spirit can we comprehend the laws by which the spirit operates
Once we know the laws of the spirit, we will learn how to follow the spirit, that is, to walk by the laws of the spirit
We are not afraid of having too much knowledge concerning the spirit; our only concern is that we pursue it too strenuously with our mind
The gospel of God tells people that fallen man can receive regeneration and that fleshly man can obtain a new spirit
The spiritual life we normally speak about is just a life in which one lives by the spirit he received at regeneration
It is very regrettable that most believers know very little about the functions of the spirit and the things related to it
They may know in terminology the relationship between man and his spirit, yet they still cannot identify this spirit in their experience
An analysis of the functions of the spirit is needed because only then will believers know how to follow the spirit
We have mentioned before that the functions of the spirit can be categorized into three parts: intuition, fellowship, and conscience
We have already seen how the spirit is categorized into intuition, fellowship, and conscience, and we will not repeat it here
We are not saying that the spirit includes only these three, neither are we saying that the spirit is just one of these three
Going one step further, we can compare the intuition, fellowship, and conscience to the ark in the Holy of Holies
Similarly, God is making Himself and His will known to the believers through their intuition so that they can follow accordingly
It bears witness to those things that are according to God's will and condemns those things that are not according to God's will
These things ought to teach believers how to deal with the ark, which is the intuition, fellowship, and conscience in our spirit
Any spiritual usefulness depends not on our thought but on the teaching of the intuition, fellowship, and conscience
The spirit dwells in the body and has a very close relationship with the body; nevertheless, it is completely different from the body
There is another sense in the innermost part of his being which can rejoice, grieve, fear, approve, condemn, determine, and discern
The Bible does not say man's heart senses and functions in this way, but his spirit does sense or function in this way
After thoroughly reading them, we will see that the functions and senses of the human spirit are as inclusive as those of the soul
Whether it is thoughts, decisions, or feelings, as long as it is something that the soul has, the spirit has it also
Believers should not follow their soul, which means that they should not follow their thoughts, feelings, or preferences
These things are opposite to what we ordinarily desire, favor, prefer, love, and hold dear, and our will has no desire to perform them
The 'prompting' of the Holy Spirit is the work of the Holy Spirit in our spirit which causes our intuition to understand His will
When the Holy Spirit reveals His will through our intuition, He does it through the innermost part of our being
Before we consider this passage of Scripture, let us first differentiate between the meaning of 'know' and 'understand'
In many cases, we know in our intuition what we ought to do, but our mind may still fall short of understanding the meaning and reason of it
Just as the mind enables man to apprehend the things of the world, the intuition enables man to apprehend the things of the spiritual realm
He does not speak from heaven with a loud voice and a flaming fire, or cast the believers to the ground with His power
It does not require the mind's searching or the emotion's stirring; the anointing expresses the Spirit's own thought independently
If we read the context of this portion of the Scriptures, we will see that the apostle spoke about many false teachings and antichrists
There is no need for man to teach or speak anything; the anointing that abides within will teach spontaneously
If we have to do this, no one except knowledgeable and intellectual believers would be able to save themselves from deceptions
These experiences show us that our intuition the organ where the Holy Spirit works is able to distinguish between right and wrong
We should not criticize a person, but we should definitely know him in order to learn how to associate with him or help him
At that time we did not know why we made those assertions; something seemed to be in our heart, but we could not utter it with our mouth
And immediately Jesus, knowing fully in His spirit that they were reasoning this way within themselves, said to them
It does not say that the Lord Jesus had a thought or feeling in His heart, nor does it say that the Holy Spirit told Him so
The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit; He enables our spirit to be fully operative and full of the power of knowledge
God does not explain what He is to man's intellect all at once, neither can man know God all at once through his intellect
No matter how wise a man's intellect is, and no matter how much he understands about God, his understanding is always veiled
He can only make inferences with his intellect about the things behind the veil; he does not see the actual things behind the veil
Revelation is something in the intuition; it is quiet, neither slow nor quick; it appears to be a voice and yet not a voice
Intellectual pursuit will never save people; only revelation in the spirit will grant men genuine knowledge of God
And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ'
Those who do not have this life the eternal life may infer things concerning God, but they do not have a personal knowledge of God
He may enthusiastically serve 'in the name of the Lord;' however, there is no regeneration of a new life in his spirit
Not only should believers receive their initial knowledge through the spirit, they should continue in this way all the time
Since they are not of the spirit, they are not the will of God; God only reveals the things concerning His will to us in our spirit
Those who walk according to their mind cannot, even for a moment, say from their heart, 'I know with certainty that this is God's will'
In answering the believer's searching, God operates in his spirit and reveals whether he should continue or stop
The difference between understanding God's will by the way of the mind and the way of the intuition is immeasurable
The zeal of an emotional believer may appear to be something spiritual, but it may not actually be from the intuition
The judgment of a rational believer likewise may appear to be something spiritual, but it also may not be a revelation from the intuition
When this happens, we will be like Abraham, who went down to Egypt where help could be obtained from things which could be seen and touched
When a believer's spirit is renewed, strengthened, and educated by the Holy Spirit, his soul loses its place and submits to the spirit
Once we understand the intuition, we will be more clear about the spirit which is usually more mysterious to us
People will not be brought into the kingdom of God through our encouraging, exhorting, arguing, inciting, attracting, and urging
Though he may have had the best mental capability, his doctrine did not come from his thoughts, either suddenly or progressively
His mind was in union with his spirit, and it just communicated to others the revelation he received in his spirit
The mind is never the organ for receiving spiritual knowledge; it is merely the organ for passing on spiritual knowledge
Unless man receives the life of God afresh, and unless his intuition is resurrected, he is forever separated from God
It is not just a term or a moral change but a definite entrance of God's life into our spirit, resurrecting our spirit and intuition
It would be very difficult for a man to be born again by himself because he has nothing that can produce any new life
No matter how much we understand doctrines, and how much we put our trust in them, they are altogether useless
God says, 'For as the heavens are higher than the earth,/So are My ways higher than your ways,/And My thoughts higher than your thoughts'
After our regeneration, God desires that we know His works and His will through our intuition so that we would walk according to them
God will instruct us all of our lives and make us realize that other than walking according to the intuition, everything else is vanity
Lies the key issue: when the intuition proposes something totally different from what the soul proposes, which one will we follow?
Formerly we warred over the problem of sins; now it is not a matter of good or evil but of natural kindness or the goodness of God
Previously we were concerned about the nature of the things we did, but now, about the source of the good things
Through the strengthening of the Holy Spirit into the spirit of the new man, he will entirely eliminate the mind of the flesh
A fleshly mind results in nothing but death in spiritual things, while a mind set on the spirit is life and peace
Just as man has fellowship with the physical world through his body, he has fellowship with the spiritual world through his spirit
Once we understand the functions of the intuition, we will understand the nature of the fellowship between God and man
Our fellowship with God is in the deepest part of our being; it is in the part that is deeper than our mind, emotion, and will
Verse 10 says, 'But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
Since it is something that has not come up in our hearts, it is even more unlikely that it would come up in our thoughts
Verses 11 and 12 continue, 'For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?
Since only the Holy Spirit knows the things of God, we can only know the things of God when we receive the Holy Spirit
When we receive in our spirit what the Holy Spirit already knows in the intuition, we also know the things of God
The Holy Spirit reveals to our spirit all that He knows in His intuition, causing our spirit's intuition to also know what He knows
The Holy Spirit does not reveal the things of God to our mind because He knows that our mind is incapable of knowing the things of God
If a man is not regenerated, his spirit is still dead; thus, God has no way to reveal to him the things pertaining to God
God's fellowship with man and man's worship of God require the regenerated spirit as the unique uniting ground
Due to ignorance or prejudice, many believers do not give a proper place to their spirit or to the intuition of the spirit
The principle of their conduct is to do things according to what they regard as reasonable, appealing, pleasing, and interesting
They do not realize that they should follow the notion expressed by their intuition through their spirit, not their own thought
Since this is our situation even in the initial step of knowing the will of God, it is no wonder that we do not have any deeper revelation
In the matter of worshipping God, we will follow either what we deem to be right, or we will follow the transient outbursts of our emotions
The apostle said that he would not use 'words taught by human wisdom' to speak about the things he knew in his spirit
The apostle said that he would not use words conjured up in his mind to speak about the things of God that he knew in his spirit
Not only is man's mind useless in knowing the things of God, it is also useless in speaking about spiritual wisdom
Many times a believer receives God's revelation, becomes clear about a certain matter, and wants to preach this to others
Even when we feel that we have expressed everything well, we still may not have conveyed the intention of the Holy Spirit
If we try to use our mind and emotion to fulfill a spiritual goal, it is just like hoping that a bitter fountain will yield sweet water
Even the mind, intellect, and rationality that is highly esteemed by man is as corrupt as man's lusts; none of them can understand God
The mind is still the mind, and the will is still the will; these cannot become the organs for fellowship with God
According to man's mind, the things that are known through intuition are foolish because they cannot be rationalized
The message of the cross not only speaks of a Savior who died for us, but of all the believers who died with Him
If this is only an idea, the mind may receive it; but if it is something to be put into practice, the mind rejects it
If he has the Spirit and has received the things of God, the intuition has a chance to know these things of God
Later the apostle says that a soulish man 'does not receive' because the things of God are 'discerned spiritually'
Do we see that the Holy Spirit is repeatedly emphasizing that man's spirit is the organ for fellowship with God?
The mind should be under the restriction of the spirit; it should act according to the will of God which is known through the intuition
If the mind, emotion, and will are all being kept in a secondary position, a believer will advance swiftly in his spiritual progress
If this does not happen, the mind, emotion, and will become the masters, and the place of the spirit will be usurped
The spiritual man discerns all things' because the intuition obtains its knowledge only through the Holy Spirit
If a believer can only gain knowledge through his intelligence, only those who are more intelligent will discern all things
These ones would also be discerned by others because whoever is their equal or whoever is more intelligent would understand their thoughts
Since the soulish man cannot know the mind of the Lord, he cannot know the spiritual man who fully submits to the Lord's mind
Corinthians 3:1-2 says, 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ
Before we cover the proper meaning of these two verses, let us look at the apostle Paul and consider how clear his spiritual perception was
The fact that these words are known through our intuition, as taught by the Holy Spirit, is what makes them spiritual words
Although man's intuition has been revived, man must still reserve a place for it and provide a chance for it to work
Otherwise, the intuition will be suppressed and unable to fellowship with God; it will not know what it is able to know
When a believer is very manipulated and in every way affected by the flesh, his spirit becomes numb and unable to receive 'solid food'
The Scripture likens a newly regenerated believer to a baby because the life he has obtained in the spirit is as feeble as a physical baby
There is no problem if the believer grows out of babyhood within a short time, because every grown-up begins by being a baby
Just as a person's consciousness is not very keen when he is born, a believer's intuition is not very sensitive when he is first regenerated
It does not mean that they do not strive to work for the Lord or have not received the gift of the Holy Spirit
We would probably say that they were the most spiritual believers because of their growth in utterance, knowledge, and gifts
If a believer's spirit, with which he fellowships with God, has not become stronger and keener in the eyes of God, he has not grown at all!
They were not able to use the intuition to serve God, to know God deeply, and to receive the revelation of God
When a believer is overly influenced by the flesh, he cannot successfully become a spiritual man and take solid food
Drinking milk only means that one cannot fellowship directly with God and needs the transmission through others
If we cannot fellowship with God and know the things of God in our intuition, all of our idealistic thinking is useless
They only want to satisfy their own lust for knowledge and want to tell others either verbally or by writing books what they have learned
Although their meanings theories and outlines are the best and although they appear very spiritual in reality they are dead in Gods view
Their knowledge comes from the mind of one person and is transferred into the mind of another without passing through the spirit
Those who listen to them or read their writings may say that they have been helped, but what kind of help have they received?
God wants to give us wisdom; He does not give it to our mind, but He gives us a spirit of wisdom so that we can have wisdom in our spirit
It often seems that our wisdom is useless, but inside us there is a gradual feeling which brings wisdom along with it
Even when our spirit is alive, we would still live in darkness if we did not have the revelation of the Holy Spirit
A spirit of revelation is God's operation in our spirit to the extent that we know His intention through our intuition
Many times we understand teachings in our mind and know that they are important, but God gradually reveals these words to us in our spirit
It is true that God's revelations are not frequent, but how frequently do we wait and pray for God's revelation?
It may be easier for us to make the wise one understand and comprehend than the foolish one, but this would only be in the realm of the mind
According to the flesh, a man has the opportunity of being better than others because of differences in natural talents
In spiritual experiences, every person has to start from the same place, go through the same procedures, and arrive at the same goal
Fleshly understanding enables one to know some truths, but these truths will only remain in one's mind and not issue in life
Revelation is what we receive from God; understanding is comprehending the revelation we have received from God
Spiritual understanding tells us the meaning of all the movement within our spirit; it enables us to know God's will
According to Colossians 1:9-10, we can see very clearly that if we want to please God and bear fruit, we should know His will in our spirit
It is vanity for a believer to try to please God on the one hand, while walking according to the soul on the other hand
Only the human spirit can fathom God's will in the spirit because only the spirit has the intuition to know God's movements
Each time we have real fellowship with God, there is a result; it trains us to know how to fellowship with Him more the next time
Since a believer has been regenerated and can fellowship with God in his intuition, he should pursue perfection
Many times we think that we really know His will, but with the passage of time and events, it is proven that we have made a mistake
Just as God's holiness condemns evil and delights in goodness, the conscience of the believers also rebukes uncleanness and pursues goodness
If the conscience is willing to confess its transgressions and the sin of unbelief, it will reproach itself and seek mercy from God
The parable of the publican who went to the temple to pray illustrates the working of the Holy Spirit in the conscience
The blood of the Lord Jesus has washed the believer of all the sins in his life therefore the conscience does not need to accuse him anymore
The precious blood of the Lord Jesus has been sprinkled on our conscience so that we may stand boldly before God
The certainty of salvation is a fact because the voice of the conscience has been silenced by the precious blood
If the heart does not believe in the precious blood, the conscience still accuses us of how evil we were before our regeneration
The following verse shows us the relationship between the conscience and man's fellowship with God in the intuition
If man wants to fellowship with God and 'serve God,' his conscience must first be cleansed by the precious blood
According to the Bible, the cleansing by the blood and the regeneration of the spirit happen at the same instant
The conscience must be cleansed by the blood so that a believer can obtain a new life and have his intuition quickened then he may serve God
When the believer is fellowshipping with God, there cannot be a lack of 'a true heart in full assurance of faith'
He should know that he has already been washed of his sins by the blood of the Lord, and that there is nothing to oppose him
A tiny offense in the conscience is sufficient to oppress, hinder, and stop the work of fellowship by the intuition
The sanctifying and renewing work of the Holy Spirit in man and the work of the conscience are mutually related and interconnected
If we do not give the conscience the position it deserves, we definitely will fall into the position of walking according to the flesh
If a fleshly believer does not allow the conscience to do a thorough job, he has no way of entering into the spiritual realm
Whenever there is progress in the Christian life, the testimony of the conscience and the testimony of the Holy Spirit are almost identical
Once the conscience reproves, they think about bribing and making peace with it so that the conscience will no longer voice its disapproval
Although explanations by way of reason may satisfy the mind, they are not sufficient to satisfy the conscience
Once the conscience has condemned a certain matter, it will never accept any reasoning or stop condemning until the matter is removed
On the other hand, he is afraid of the condemnation of the conscience which troubles him and makes him feel miserable
Even if the offering is many times more than what is required by God, it will not stop the voice of the conscience
If we want to walk according to the spirit all the time, we must humble ourselves and give heed to the corrections of the conscience
A believer should not make a general confession, thinking that his mistakes are so numerous that they cannot be articulated
He must humbly, quietly, and submissively allow the conscience to rebuke and condemn him of his sins one by one
He must accept the rebuke of the conscience and be willing, according to the mind of the Holy Spirit, to remove everything that opposes God
Are you willing to allow the conscience to place your entire living and conduct before you, according to God's mind?
It also indicates that you do not completely submit to God in many things, nor do you walk according to the spirit
If we are still involved with sins and not completely cut off from sins, then most of our spirituality may be false
Other than the imaginary spirit which leads him the real spirit is persistently demanding that he listen to the speaking of the conscience
The intuition will be greatly helped, and its keenness in understanding the intention of the Holy Spirit will be increased
He should let Christ be the Lord of his life again, and he should be willing to be taught and rely on the teachings of the Holy Spirit
The greatest knowledge, diligent toil, fervent emotion, and firmness of will, can never replace the keenness of the conscience
If he allows his spiritual life to be continually hurt, eventually the believer will definitely fall into a fleshly position
The conscience spoken of here is not the conscience of an unregenerated man, but a conscience filled with the Holy Spirit
The apostle was bold in going forward to have full fellowship with God because his regenerated conscience did not reprove him
If we do not keep His commandments and the things which are pleasing to Him, our hearts will naturally be rebuked
They may misunderstand us and they may misjudge us, just as the apostles were misunderstood and misjudged by the believers in the past
Because of following the Lord, many people may often disparage us, even though we are actually obeying the Lord
At other times men will extol us because of what they see in us; however, most of this comes from sudden emotions or imaginations
Outward praise and criticism are not the criteria; only the testimony of our own resurrected conscience counts for anything
Or does the conscience testify that we conduct ourselves in this world, according to the singleness and sincerity of God?
The testimony was that 'not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world'
The conscience strives for and insists that the believer live by the grace of God and not according to fleshly wisdom
The intuition leads the believer, and the conscience urges the believer to obey the intuition when he thinks of disobeying it
If we desire to have a conscience void of offense, we should not depart for a moment from the blood that washes us eternally
We not only have to seek for a good conscience towards God, we also have to seek for a good conscience towards man
A conscience without offense not only is able to testify for us before man, but it also enables us to receive God's promises
Today's believers often complain that their faith is too small and therefore, that they are unable to have a completely spiritual living
Naturally, there may be many causes, but is not an offense in the conscience one of the most important causes?
Being void of offense having no offense whatever and being completely without fear before God are the necessary conditions of the conscience
In living according to the spirit, a believer should never allow his conscience to be unclear in any small matter
The believer should seek for the cleansing of the blood immediately and allow no trace of this matter to remain
We cannot act according to someone else's standard, nor can we expect others to live according to the light we have
In God's fellowship with man, He cares about our attitude toward His will, not how much we know concerning His will
The believer does not have to grieve for anything that he does not know, nor does he need to strive to do anything
Only then can we have fellowship with God, and only then will the blood of His Son cleanse us from all our sins
We must remember that even though the conscience is very crucial, the conscience is not the measurement of our holiness because of knowledge
In our fellowship with God, God uses the matter of having a conscience void of offense as the condition of His fellowship with us
After we completely submit to the guidance of the conscience, we should never think, even for a moment, that we are already 'perfect'
A good conscience only tells us that according to what we know, we have achieved what we should achieve at the present
As our biblical knowledge increases and our spiritual experiences grow, the standard of our conduct will also rise accordingly
In the gradual increase of light, our conduct must become gradually more holy for our conscience to be preserved without offense
Once we have another year of knowledge and experience, our conscience will accuse us if our conduct is the same as the previous year's
In the previous year God did not cut off His fellowship with us, because we were ignorant of our transgressions
Once we have knowledge of the same transgressions, the fellowship with God will be lost if we do not renounce them
The Lord still has many things to speak to us, but because of the immaturity of our spiritual understanding, He still has to wait
Some matters are considered to be extremely evil and sinful by some believers, yet others may not feel the same way
If the will has been surrendered, then any time the conscience receives light, a believer will walk according to the will of God
We do not have to extend ourselves to use the strength of the soul to understand many truths for which the right time has not come
If we can live every day according to the leading of the conscience, we have attained to the level we presently should attain to
If we compare the standard of the conscience with the standard of God's holiness, the standard of the conscience is very inferior
Even though we are at fault God is well pleased and He fellowships with us because we have acted according to the leading of the conscience
If the children were to do what the father does it would definitely not be permitted due to their lack of knowledge experience and position
If, according to the conscience of a believer, a certain thing is permitted, and he does it, he is doing the will of God
At that time, the believers in Corinth had many misunderstandings about the matter of eating things offered to idols
When they saw that the food they were eating had been offered to idols, they could not help remembering the past
The former, because of their knowledge, were not rebuked by their conscience; therefore, after eating, they did not sin
The latter, because of their lack of knowledge, were not at peace in their conscience; therefore, their eating became their sin
More knowledge can sometimes cause the conscience to condemn more, but it can also cause the conscience to have less condemnation
Such knowledge should be kept with a humble heart; otherwise, we will fall into the flesh like the Corinthian believers
Concerning more spiritual things, regardless of how much knowledge we possess, there can never be the difference of freedom or bondage to us
Older believers have a big danger in this regard; their conscience may be too strong, and it may become cold and hard
Often the knowledge which we have gained is acquired through the intelligence of the mind, and it is not the revelation of the intuition
A believer who does not have knowledge can only understand with his mind the knowledge that his brother possesses
May we always remember that we should not walk according to the knowledge that we have, even if it is only for a short period of time
All believers, regardless of their knowledge, should walk according to the intuition and the conscience of the spirit
Concerning the conduct of believers, God cares more for their obedience to His will than for their good conduct
Through the conscience, God observes whether our priority is submitting to Him or whether we have other motives
Even though it is influenced by knowledge, all of its speaking represents the highest will of God for us today
Many believers do not possess any liveliness today because they did not care for their conscience but only kept dead knowledge in their mind
We should never be satisfied with spiritual knowledge; we must treasure the matter of walking according to the spirit
Perhaps all spiritual believers know something about the functions of the spirit as we mentioned earlier, but what they know does not last
They only sometimes have spiritual experiences because they still do not clearly understand all the functions and laws of the spirit
If their intuition had sufficient growth, they could always walk according to the spirit and not be affected by the outside world
Neither do they know the proper condition of the spirit; therefore, they cannot receive continual guidance from the spirit
Sometimes they receive a revelation from the intuition, but they do not know why it is given at a particular time
If they could always walk according to the law of the spirit as they did unconsciously, they would always receive the leading of the spirit
We must learn to discover their meaning before we can act according to the spirits requirements and walk continually according to the spirit
Many believers treat the Holy Spirit's occasional working in their spirit as the most wonderful experiences of their life
If they followed the spirit according to the law of the spirit, they would see their life becoming so transcendent
When thinking, he ought to know the source of his thought; when feeling, the source of his feeling; and when working, what power to use
We can also be kept from working according to feeling, and we can know whether the things that happen to us are of the spirit or the soul
Harmful self-consciousness includes those proud or discouraging thoughts derived from considering one's own successes or failures
Beneficial self-analysis concerns itself only with those considerations that investigate the source of thoughts, feelings, and preferences
God desires that we should get rid of self-consciousness, but He does not mean that we should live in the world brainlessly
If he waits patiently, discerning again and again the source of his feeling, the Holy Spirit will reveal the truth to him at the proper time
When they desire to be spiritual and walk according to the spirit, they often fall into the trap of the opposite inclination
Since he realizes that his zealous life style in the past was soulish, he misjudges his present rationality as being spiritual
Since he also realizes that his cool life style in the past was soulish, he regards his present emotion as being spiritual
The Holy Spirit can no doubt cause one to sense Him through his feelings, but seeking Him according to emotion is exceedingly harmful
Often we see someone who has had the 'baptism of the Holy Spirit' still living according to the natural life and not according to the spirit
By observing Paul's conduct, we can better realize the importance of walking according to the intuition of the spirit
He did not confer with flesh and blood; he no longer needed to listen to men's opinions, thoughts, and arguments
Once he had obtained the revelations of God in his intuition and understood the will of God, he no longer sought other proofs
We should not follow the words of some spiritual person, but instead, the direct guidance of the Lord Himself in our spirit
Our gospel must not be obtained from listening to a certain man, from reading a certain book, or from a certain mental exercise
A believer may receive many wonderful thoughts from another person's mind, and yet his spirit may still be poor and empty
He can cause their bodies to be filled with many kinds of strange feelings and their minds with many wandering thoughts
Let us repeat, in spiritual warfare a believer must never act according to his own feelings or some sudden thoughts
Satan not only uses feelings and thoughts to cause the believers to live by the soul and not walk by the spirit; he has far worse devices
Once the spirit stops working, there can be no co-laboring with the Holy Spirit, and everything from God is cut off
He may cause the believer to be in anguish without reason, but tell him that this is suffering with Christ in the spirit
In these conditions, Satan will deceive the believer through this counterfeit spirit, so that he actually follows his will
A spiritual believer must possess spiritual knowledge so that all his conduct and actions are according to his rationality
Whatever he encounters during the day is treated lightly; many times he even accepts the arrangements of the enemy
The power and characteristics of a spiritual believer come from 'interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words'
The Holy Spirit gives them this power so that in their living they will not allow the things that are happening to them to go untested
Often they are afraid of mistaking the condemnation of the conscience for the accusation of the evil spirit and consequently disobeying God
If the believer has really sinned, he can always confess immediately before God and ask for the cleansing of the precious blood
Having determined to do God's will, he must thoroughly investigate whether a matter was definitely done by him
He must clearly know and ascertain that it was his doings, because often the evil spirit accuses us of unrelated matters
Otherwise, even though he may not have committed any sin, Satan will cause him to suffer as if he had really sinned
A believer may feel, he must prove with certainty what is really true so that he can decide whether he has sinned or not
If it is from the Holy Spirit, and he is sincerely willing to remove it, the present delay is not due to his rebellion but to uncertainty
A believer must absolutely reject the confession of sins compelled by an external power, because the enemy often uses this strategy
In short, genuine self-condemnation caused by the Holy Spirit sanctifies us; Satan's purpose is merely for accusation
A believer's determination to be completely separated from sin, leaving no ground for the evil spirit to accuse, is very crucial today
It is extremely important not to mistake the feelings from the soul or the body for the intuition of the spirit
Are two difficulties: first, we mistake other feelings as the intuition of the spirit; second, we misunderstand the meaning of the intuition
It is impossible for the Holy Spirit to inspire the prophets to write the Scriptures in one way, and then move in us in another way today
The revelation of the Holy Spirit sensed in our spirit perfectly matches the revelation of the Holy Spirit in the Bible
We think that if we absolutely follow the Bible, we surely must be in accordance with the desire of the Holy Spirit
Although what was understood and carried out is completely according to the Bible, there was absolutely no reliance on the Holy Spirit
If the doctrines that we understand in our minds are not executed through the power of the spirit, they have no spiritual value at all
There is a great danger for us to live excessively by our own spirit or walk excessively according to our own spirit
Although the Bible attaches great importance to the individual spirit of the believer, we may fall into the danger of being extreme
We live and walk according to the spirit because this spirit is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, who makes known His will through our spirit
We must realize that apart from the Holy Spirit, the human spirit is just as useless as the other parts of our being
Much of the failure, fighting, hatred, division, shame, and pain is due to believers , who acted alone according to their own spirit
A spiritual believer should know when to go on alone, without regard to others' advice, and when to listen to his brothers
There is no such thing as expecting certain methods to help us bypass considerable travel on the spiritual path
A believer must learn to know the sense of the spirit because this is the first condition of walking according to the spirit
If he does not know what is the sense of the spirit and the feeling of the soul, he will not be able to walk according to the spirit
A man must be able to interpret the senses in his body before he will know how to meet its needs with material things
In the same way a believer must learn to know the senses in his spirit what they mean what their demands are and how to meet their demands
Since we fail to identify the many things that come from the spirit as being spiritual, the spirit loses its place in our daily life
Many times he feels that his spirit is suppressed and not free; a thousand pounds of weight seem to press upon him
Many times believers ignore such weight and continue with their work, only to find that it becomes worse and worse
Many times, God wants to use these believers, but they are not able to fulfill God's work because of this weight
If they find themselves with this weight in the morning and do not immediately remove it, they will be defeated the entire day
If there is any pressure in a believer's spirit, he will lose his power of discernment and the genuine leading from God
When the spirit is suppressed, the mind is affected, and when the mind fails to work, everything stops or runs into error
Once you experience pressure or weight in your spirit, it is very important for you to immediately deal with it
If you do not try to remove it, you will become accustomed to it after a period of time and not try to remove it at all
You will find that all spiritual things appear burdensome, and you will find it hard to go on in the spiritual journey
The way to deal with it is to immediately stop what you are doing and take care of the demand of the spiritual senses
While you are rejecting the work of the enemy, you should, at the same time, reject the cause of the enemy's work
If the soul and body are attacked by the evil spirits and become abnormal, the spirit will be blocked and have no outlets
He often works in a believers soul and body causing them to lose their function so that the spirit no longer has an organ for its expression
Satan has imprisoned the spirit and locked it up in a dark room so that the soul no longer has the leading of the spirit
Once the thing that blocks the spirit is removed, the believer will find the outlets cleared, and he will recover his former lightness
The best kind of prayer at such a time is to call on the victorious name of the Lord Jesus and withstand all the attacks of the enemy
He can shoot sorrow, sadness, suffering, grief, and heartbreak into a believer's spirit, causing him to have a 'sorrowful spirit'
When a believer feels sorrowful, he thinks he is feeling sorrowful, considering this sorrow to be very natural
We will lose all of our love for men and all of our gentleness, sympathy, and considerations for the weaknesses of others
A spiritual believer considers God's business as his own business and the whole church as the object of his love
Satan causes the believers to think that they are not destitute that they are somewhat important and that they have some worth in Gods work
If believers do not oppose them, subconsciously accepting them instead, they will soon turn into sins of the flesh
When we consider the experience of the two disciples, we can see that a wrong spirit is very easily detected in our words
Perhaps what we say is true, but a spirit of criticism, condemnation, wrath, and jealousy may be lurking behind truthful words
Believers should learn to guard their spirit from the provocation of the enemy and to guard their spirit in sweetness and gentleness
If believers are hit by the darts, they should immediately remove the cause of the fiery darts and take up an opposing stand
It may also be caused by the invasion of the power of darkness from the outside, or even by self-centered prayer and worship
If they do not deal with this introspection immediately, they will quickly find themselves surrounded by the soul
Sometimes believers are deceived, and their spirits are depressed because they do not understand the position Christ holds
The Holy Spirit abides in the believers for the purpose of unveiling to them the Christ that is sitting on the throne
The believers' spirit is joined to the heavenly Christ, but in their ignorance, they may turn inward to look for Christ
In this way, their spirit cannot be uplifted above the clouds, and they are depressed and fall into the realm of the soul
Once they have experienced the power of the Holy Spirit infused into their spirit, a new world seems to open up before them
Satan's work is to prevent the believers from living a life in the spirit, because such a life is very damaging to him
When this happens, believers will live in the outward soul or the body which frustrates the innermost spirit from working together with God
If this continues for a long time, the person will become completely fallen and may even become possessed by the evil spirits
A believer must learn to maintain his spirit in a constant outward posture; it should never turn itself inward
Only when the believers' spirit is flowing outward will the Holy Spirit spread His own life to others through their spirit
If the believers turn inward and suppress their spirit, the life of the Holy Spirit will not be able to flow out
Once a believer detects any leakage in his spirit, he should realize that his spirit is sick and that he should seek a remedy at once
The weight of the spirit is from Satan, and its purpose is to cause believers to suffer; Satan uses the weight to suppress them
The burden of the spirit is a burden from God, and its goal is to cause men to work, intercede, and preach for God
Satan does not give any burden to the believers; he only surrounds the believers' spirit and oppresses the believers with the weight
A person who bears a burden only has to bear the burden itself; but a person who is oppressed is bound in his whole being
The weight of the spirit creeps in secretly, while the burden in the spirit is the result of the Holy Spirit's work in our spirit
The weight of the spirit is painful and suppresses the believers' life; the burden in the spirit is joyful because it cooperates with God
When God wants us to do something, say something, or pray for something, He first gives us a burden in our spirit
A spirit that has been filled with weight is no longer keen in its intuition and cannot be a good vessel anymore
As a result his spirit suffers for many days from the burden, and he is not able to receive any fresh burden from God
It is very important to find out the meaning of a burden in prayer by the Holy Spirit and through the exercise of the mind
When there is a burden in our spirit to pray, nothing can alleviate this burden and nothing can release us except prayer
We must try our best to thoroughly pray out what is burdening us in our spirit, until the burden is fully removed from us
The more we express our life in our prayers as well as everything we have, the more comfortable we will become
It is very unfortunate that believers do not realize that the burden in the spirit is the source of real spiritual work
If we listen to Satan and think that there is something wrong with us, we will come under his accusations even more and suffer
When believers are soulish, they consider it as a spiritual peak when they feel God's presence in their feelings making them feel happy
In the latter case, a person feels that the life and power within his spirit, which he once received, have suffered a gradual setback
His life is not like the tide of the sea which rises and falls; it is like a river which flows forever with living water
If a believer feels that his life has ebbed away, he should realize that his life is not ebbing away; it has merely stopped flowing
Once a believer feels that his spiritual life appears to be ebbing away, he should find out where it is blocked
The real reason is that many believers do not know how to cooperate with God and fulfill God's condition for having an unceasing flow
Not only should you acknowledge that you have setbacks an important step in itself but you should actively seek the reason for such setbacks
Every time there is a spiritual 'ebbing away,' we should immediately find the reason through prayer and meditation
When the human spirit deviates from its normal condition, it becomes isolated from the Holy Spirit and loses its light
It is very important for a believer to maintain his spirit in a healthy condition, so that it can cooperate with the Holy Spirit
All of the above situations can cause the spirit to neglect its responsibility and fail to cooperate with the Holy Spirit
They will find that they have no strength to withstand the temptations of the day and to fulfill the work of the day
After they understand this, they should confess that their spirit has neglected its duty and is under the attack of the enemy
They should consider how the enemy has attacked their spirit and consider their environment, family, relatives, children, and careers
If a believer does not exercise any control over his spirit and make it subject to the Holy Spirit, it can act independently
A believer must have a willing spirit , and he must be willing to respond to the will of the Holy Spirit within the shortest period of time
A believer's spirit must be very sensitive to be able to sense the small voice of the Holy Spirit and respond immediately
Believers must maintain their spirit in a pliable condition and always follow the tender sense in their spirit
An examination of the condition of the spirit is the central issue that we have spoken about in the above discussion
The spirit should rule over man's soul and body; it should have the highest preeminence and be the most powerful part
Many times through his own carelessness or through the attacks of the enemy, a believer's spirit is 'pushed aside,' and becomes depressed
At such times, he loses his heavenly, bright, and victorious position and becomes cold, crippled, and flattened
A believer can be excited in the soul and become ecstatic to the extent that his spirit is agitated and loses its calmness
At still other times, it appears as a mixture of soulish activities in the spirit like natural love, feelings, and thoughts
He should know how to exercise his will to stop the hyperactive spirit and turn it back to its normal condition
Understanding the laws of the spirit without understanding the principle of the mind assisting the spirit will still cause us to fail
The laws of the spirit only explain to us the various senses of the spirit, their significance, and the way to fulfill their demands
If the spirit remains inactive for a few days, should we not do anything for a few days and wait until the spirit moves?
When the spirit is sleeping we should use our mind to work in place of the spirit and before very long the spirit will also join in to work
When our spirit is oppressed by Satan, or when we are entangled by our natural life, we sometimes do not even sense where our spirit is
The way to pray is according to the truth which we know and remember in our mind, standing against the principality of darkness
He thinks that he does not have the 'sense' to fight and should wait until he has such a sense before attacking the enemy with prayers
We have to consider and pray according to what we know in our mind, then what we acquired previously will fill our spirit
In the beginning we no doubt knew these truths in the spirit, but now it seems as if the spirit has faded and there is only the memory
What should we do to have our spirit once again filled with these truths in order to spread these truths to others from our spirit?
Rather, it means that we should use our mind to intercede, hoping to stimulate the collaboration of the spirit
At this moment we should exercise our mind to consider whether our friends, family, and co-workers have any need
If the spirit within us still remains cold, we should realize that He does not want us to pray for that matter
After we have obtained the cooperation of the sense of the spirit, we should pour out all the burdens of the spirit for this matter
We should pray for the various aspects of this matter in a detailed and adequate way until our spirit is unloaded
At such a time, the believer should use his mind to consider and ponder his doubts and difficulties before God
When he senses the spirit, which was previously silent, the Holy Spirit will lead him in the spirit before too long
We should know that only the activities that are done in the spirit have spiritual value therefore we should not walk according to the mind
Some pumps require a cup of water to be poured in first in order to create some suction power which draws the water up as we are pumping
When our spirit is weak and cannot help itself, the mind should act as the spirit's nursing mother to look after it
When the spirit descends from its controlling position, the believer should use the power of the mind to pray and raise it up again
Once you acquire the sense of the spirit, this indicates that the spirit wanted to work this way, but it was too weak to do so
Regarding assisting the spirit, another point must be observed: spiritual warfare involves spirit warring with spirit
When our spirit wrestles with the evil spirit, the strength of our entire being is one with the spirit for the battle
If the spirit becomes suppressed and loses its strength to resist, the mind should continually fight for the spirit
When the mind fights by praying, resisting, and opposing, the spirit will receive a supply to rise up once again for the battle
Concentrating on one theme anxiety sorrow or overly considering what the will of God is makes the mind unable to bear the burden and work
When the Holy Spirit leads a believer to consider a matter through the spirit, an interruption by others is a very fearful thing
If a thought is interrupted, the mind will be stretched, and consequently, it is harder to work with the spirit
If a believer desires to walk according to the spirit, he must continuously keep himself in a proper condition
Without the Holy Spirit guarding his spirit, a believer will fail in his outward conduct once his spirit fails
We should realize that behind the many failures in outward conduct, the spirit has failed even before the conduct failed
The Lord does not care for the outward man, the soul, in a Christian; He pays attention to our inward man, the spirit
If our inward man is not in a proper condition, our entire living will be upside-down, even though our soul-life is still very prosperous
Since we have already mentioned the importance of the spirit being in a proper condition, we do not need to repeat it
God does not want us to occasionally repent, thinking that this is enough; He wants us to continually repent with contrition in our living
Consequently, as soon as there is any discord with the Holy Spirit in our living and conduct, we can immediately sense it and grieve over it
Repentance with contrition is very necessary because a believer, even though joined to the Lord in one spirit, still can err
The spirit can err ; even if the spirit does not err, the mind can become blurred, not knowing how to execute the intent of the spirit
God saves only those with a contrite spirit; He cannot save any other because He needs a contrite spirit to reveal His intent
God is pleased when the spirit of the believer is very careful, as if it is always under rebuke and beating, fearing God and His word
The presumptuous and self-willed heart must be completely broken, allowing the word of God to be the guide in all things
Since his spirit has already been beaten, he dares not lift up his head; instead, he always obeys the command of God
He becomes extremely cautious in all things, knowing that they will doubtlessly fail without the intervening and keeping power of God
A spirit with any amount of hardness is unlike that of the Lord; therefore, it is unable to fellowship with the Lord
The spirit must be humble, always waiting on the Lord, and without any resistance towards the Lord before it can walk with Him
A believer's experience, growth, and progress very often become self-valued treasures in his spirit, causing it to lose its poverty
If a believer has the deepest experience and constantly remembers the experience, it is like cargo in his spirit and becomes a snare to him
If a believer retains something for himself, his spirit will immediately turn inward and be unable to 'reach out' to be joined in God
Even though one is protected by the law and able to take revenge, he would by no means use his fleshly arm to redress himself
The flesh can become enthusiastic for a moment from stimulation or emotion, but this is only temporary and does not last long
Even when the flesh is most zealous, it can still be very lazy because it will only be zealous for the things which suit its will
When our emotion is utterly disinterested we should let our fervent spirit control everything not letting our lukewarm feelings overcome us
If we act whenever our spirit is provoked, we fear that all the resulting actions will be against the will of God
Regardless of any changes in soul, body, or environment, the calmness within the spirit will definitely not be lost
Just like the sea, regardless of how much the waves roar on the surface of the sea, the bottom of the sea is always very quiet and still
No matter how disturbing the outward circumstances are, they cannot cause him to lose the calmness and peace within
It should be fervent in the Lord's work, but it should also maintain a cool attitude when doing the Lord's work
The spirit of a believer should take the attitude of brokenness towards self , while simultaneously rejoicing in God
The believer rejoices not because of something joyful or because of any personal experience, work, blessing, or environment
The hidden man of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very costly in the sight of God'
Confused thoughts and garrulous speakings are sufficient to cause our spirit to wander outside the control of our will
Before the mouth will be quiet, the spirit must be quiet, because whatever is in the spirit will come out from the mouth
Whatever the stale spirit generates words, teachings, attitudes, thoughts, living is stale and old and belongs to the past
When we stand in front of such a person, we almost feel as if he has just come from the Lord's presence and has brought us before the Lord
They do not give people dry, rotten, and infested manna in the mind but fish and bread on the fire of coals in the spirit
No matter how deep and how marvelous some thoughts may seem, they can never touch people the way the new and fresh spirit can
No matter whether it is our life, thought, or experience, if something becomes a memory in the past, it is stale
Imitating others, without the experience in life, definitely does not count, but even imitating one's own past experience also has no effect
A spirit that is not new and fresh cannot bear fruit in labor, cannot walk according to the Spirit in life, and cannot overcome in battle
We must always be watchful to have the attitude of being dead so that sin will not overcome us or enter into our spirit to poison it
Sometimes when we want to help others, seeing the heavy burden in their spirit, we feel how powerless our own spirit is
We cannot expect the Holy Spirit to replace us in doing all the work; our regenerated spirit needs to co-labor with the Holy Spirit
If a believer allows his mind or emotion to control his spirit, then his spirit cannot be one with other believers
He believes in and expects that God will greatly use him, as if the effect of his work will shortly result in much fruit
In this prosperous situation, God's brake presses down as if to ask him to terminate all the work and prepare for another path
Many of God's children do not know that besides the best possible work that progresses, there is something even better to ascend
Believers should pray, hope, believe, and be willing to remove all obstacles in order to obtain this raptured spirit
Our life and work should always be checked against the raptured spirit so that we will know where we have failed
We should pray in order to know how matters in the world relate to our spirit; in this way we know how to overcome
Even though God wants us to expect ascension with a single heart, we should not just care about being raptured
We should not ignore the needs of others and forget about the final work on the earth, as God has distributed to us
In our living and work we should always see that the 'gravity of the heavens' is much stronger than the 'gravity of the earth'
May the worldly things be so powerless that we not only dislike being 'of the world,' we also dislike being 'in the world'
May we be so single in minding the things which are above that even the best works in the world cannot distract us
Although the soul includes three primary parts the mind, emotion, and will most soulish believers live by their emotion
In order to help believers understand, we will subdivide emotion briefly into three major parts: affection, desire, and feeling
If believers do not live according to the spirit but according to their emotion is it any wonder that their living undulates like the waves
The small and delicate sense of the spirit is often confused and ignored by the believer because his feelings are roaring like billows
We can adequately feel the sense of the spirit, but when other feelings are mixed with it, we cannot possibly have discernment
At that moment a believer will spontaneously take the emotion as his inspiration and the impulses of the soul as the moving of the spirit
Emotion always enters from outside of man, whereas inspiration is given by the Holy Spirit within man's spirit
Perhaps, when he sees a loved one, some kind of inconceivable feeling rises up within him as though a certain power is drawing him
Both the beautiful scenery and the loved one are outside the man; hence, the feelings which they produce simply belong to emotion
It does not need to be stimulated by the beautiful scenery or a dear one; it can take place in the calmest environment
Since he is no longer enthusiastic and has become extremely calm, he may think that he is walking according to spirit
What he does not know is that he is still walking according to his emotion, only this time it is according to another aspect of the emotion
It is very pitiful when a believer is influenced by his emotion his spirit is powerless to subject his emotion to death and deny its control
In these circumstances, they do not have much experience and do not know how to reject the impulse of their emotion when it is activated
Their emotion becomes all the more intense until they lose control of themselves and walk according to their emotion
If the believer is not spiritual, as in the first case mentioned above, he is overcome by the intense feeling of his emotion
Outwardly the emotion and the spiritual sense appear identical; therefore, the believer finds it difficult to differentiate between them
The believer should realize that if he walks according to the spirit, all of his actions must be according to certain principles
If it is 'yes,' it is 'yes,' whether the sky is cloudy or clear; if it is 'no,' it is 'no,' whether one is excited or despondent
If he feels cold, melancholy, and despondent, he will not fulfill his duty because his feelings do not go along with it
One distinct characteristic of a spiritual believer in his dealings with his circumstances is the fact that he is most calm
If he does not allow the cross to deal with his emotion he will be very susceptible to outward influence regulation movement and stimulation
Whenever there is a slight threat from outside or a slight increase in work, they panic and are at a loss as to what to do
He should never decide to do anything or begin to do anything when his heart is in an upheaval and his emotion is in an uproar
Our mind also becomes unreliable when our feeling is in a confused state, because the mind is very easily affected by emotion
When the emotion is agitated and the mind is deceived, the conscience loses its standard for accurately discerning right from wrong
In such a condition, whatever the believer decides to do is bound to be improper and will cause many regrets afterwards
Sometimes our emotion is peaceful and calm, but because we act according to our own will, we stir up the emotion
Elsewhere we have emphasized that only the spirit can do spiritual work; all other works are without spiritual value
He must not consider using the power of his emotion through tears, a sad countenance, weeping, or other emotional expressions to save people
Those who work for the Lord must clearly see that if they depend on themselves, nothing in them can generate God's life
It seems that those who have a natural attraction have the upper hand, and that the result of their work is superior to others
Those who have no natural attraction are seemingly defeated, and the achievement of their work is inferior to others
The apostle's intention was to cover up everything belonging to the soul, regardless of whether it was naturally attractive
We lose spiritual strength because we use too much of our emotion and have so much desire, affection, and feeling
When the cross deals with our desires and enables us to live for God, spiritual power spontaneously will be manifested from us
If a believer does not overcome his emotion in spiritual work, the emotion will hinder him in many ways from going on
As long as the influence of the emotion is present, the believer's spiritual strength is not sufficient to regulate his emotion
We need to distinguish whether our need for rest is due to bodily fatigue emotional weariness or both bodily fatigue and emotional weariness
The cross would deal with all the natural life of the emotion, renew it, and make it an instrument of the spirit
Being entirely spiritual and delivering the emotion to the cross do not mean that a believer will lose his emotion and become emotionless
In delivering our soul to the cross, we must remember that the life of the soul is lost, not the function of the soul
We must always remember this fact: losing the soul is to solely and continuously live by the life of God, not living by the natural life
It is being willing to not live according to self or walk according to the pleasure of the self, but to submit to God's will
For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection'
Death and resurrection cause the functioning organs of the soul to lose their life and then cause them to be renewed and used by the Lord
If anyone has difficulty here, the problem lies in his theory because no problem exists in his spiritual experience
The goal of the work of the cross is for the spirit to have the authority to regulate the function of the emotion
In the experience of a believer, perhaps the most difficult thing is to submit to the Lord in the matter of love
It is easy to present our time, money, ability, and many other things to the Lord, but it is difficult to offer our love to Him
Loving the Lord in these ways should not be considered as consecration, because we have not yet consecrated our love
Without bearing the cross and offering to the Lord all that we love, how can we have the power of the Holy Spirit?
How many parents love their children so much that they hold back their children and cause God's kingdom to suffer loss!
Many believers are reluctant to part with their friends, so they remain behind while their brother fights alone at the front
They do not realize that if they love their loved ones they cannot love the Lord and if they love the Lord they cannot love their loved ones
May we ask God to shine His light that we may see the reason for our activities and the intensity of our love towards Him
When a believer has other loves besides God, he will find out that God gradually becomes less important to him
Although his loved ones may also love God, he will perhaps love God for the sake of his loved ones more than for the sake of God Himself
If his loved ones can influence him to love God today, they can also influence him to lose his love for God in the future
At this time, we probably have less of an interest in drawing near to God than we do of drawing near to the loved one
We will not be able to keep our heart from loving the vanities of the world because we can please our loved ones with them
When He wants us to love a certain person we can obey when He wants us to terminate our relationship with a certain person we can also obey
When we have really passed through death, we will not be attached to anyone; we will be guided only by God's commands
God often 'strips' the believer of his loved ones because of the believer's consecration or for the benefit of the believer
Perhaps our loved one has gone on a far journey, perhaps he has deceased, or perhaps there are other circumstances
Although he loved others in the past, he loved himself even more, considering himself more important than others
Believers should know that letting God direct their affection is an essential prerequisite to their spiritual growth
If it is not subdued under God's purpose, there is a possibility of endangering our spiritual life at any time
The believer's love, even for the purpose of loving the Lord, should be completely under the control of the spirit
They speak about their Father God; they call the Lord their 'dear Lord'; and they remember the sufferings of the Lord
The outward appearance of the Lord's sufferings moves their heart, but the truth contained therein does not influence their lives
When they think about these things, they become proud of how they love the Lord and of how others cannot compare with them!
The reason they remember the Lord, talk about the Lord, and long for the Lord is just because this makes them feel happy
If it is soulish, this kind of love does not have the power to help a believer to be permanently delivered from the world
If it is the love of God, no matter what situation or position he is in, he still loves God without any change
Soulish love ceases when the effect of the emotion ceases; spiritual love is strong, cruel, and does not let go
The Lord often causes a believer to experience what he considers to be painful in order that the believer would not love God for himself
When the believer loves the Lord with his own love for himself, he has to sense the Lord's love in order to love Him
Only by the attraction of the Lord's love can the believer leave all for the Lord and come forward to the Lord
In the initial stage of the believer's spiritual life, it is necessary and helpful to have the sense of the Lord's love
After the experience of feeling the Lords love and after a suitable period of time the believer should not hold on to this kind of feeling
If we want to walk according to the spirit, we should keep our love calm; otherwise, we cannot hear the voice of the intuition directly
The believer should continually pay attention in the spirit to the people and things that stimulate his affection
If we treat people differently for no other reason than that they are of the opposite sex, then our affection is still natural
In his work and while working, a worker should be cautious that his work is not penetrated by any thought about the opposite sex
All the speaking and attitudes that are influenced by the opposite sex are enough to nullify true spiritual power
The important point is whether the affection is entirely under God's governing or whether it has the effect of the soul in it
Before a believer experiences the thorough working of the cross, it is best not to have friends of the opposite sex
Any time we feel that it is difficult for us to give up someone, we should realize that our soul-life is in control
If our love cannot submit to God's purpose in any area, then there must be a great many unspiritual things mixed in with that area
The extent to which a believer dies to his affections and his seeking for love is the extent to which he is spiritual
Because we have too many desires, our feelings become confused and we are unable to quietly walk according to the spirit
Even after he has been delivered from outward, apparent sins, his desire still pursues many things for himself, independent of God
When the believer is soulish, his will has not yet submitted to the Lord, and he still has many ideas of his own
To desire is to cooperate with one's own ideas, to delight in all the ideas of one's will, and to desire one's ideas to be accomplished
All self-pleasure, self-glory, self-exaltation, self-love, self-pity, and self-respect come from the desire of man
Let us consider: is there anything which man desires and likes that does not correspond to any of the 'selfs' noted above?
Any hidden tendency to boast of ones position family traditions health disposition ability appearance and power comes from mans emotion
Even considering that a gift one has received from God is superior to that of others is a thought urged by the emotion
His desire of self-love is hurt whenever men do not honor him, but he is full of joy when he is esteemed by someone
In short, his heart of vainglory is still alive; he still seeks after what he loves and what inflates his self
The ambition to spread self-fame, to become one who is above all men, or to be honored by people are all from the soul-life
In our spiritual life, the pursuit of growth, depth, and nobler experiences is often for our happiness and others' appreciation
If we traced the life and work of the believer to their source, we would find a strange fact: a great part is actually for self!
The function of his soul can also be seen in the way the believer walks and is even more evident in the way he talks and does things
If the believer is urged by his emotional desire in these things, it is impossible for him to walk by the spirit
The more spiritual a believer becomes, the more ordinary he is, because he is united with God in His arrangements
Only emotional believers have a kind of chivalrous nature and take risky actions to satisfy their own hearts and create a great sensation
The emotion cannot bear allowing believers to live completely for God; it absolutely opposes the life that is constantly for God
There is no need to speak of much, just a day's living; no need to mention other things, just the warfare of prayers
Emotion does not know the meaning of waiting for God, waiting for God's revelation, or following the leading of the Holy Spirit
God does not want the believer to walk by the flesh, so the believer must be willing to put his hurried emotion to death
If the believer acts in a hasty manner, he will see that God causes his work to be ineffective; then he has no choice but to deny himself
More often than not, the Lord desires that His people commit all things into His hand and not vindicate themselves
If he vindicates himself according to the desire of the self, he will learn that the power of self is harder to subdue the next time
He cannot commit his burden to the Lord, nor can he silently let God bring him into a deeper death through these matters
The believer should know that the most effective way for him to really lose his soul-life is to not seek men's sympathy and comfort
God's purpose is that the believer would live in the spirit and also be willing to completely put his soul-life to death
If the believer walks by his own likes even though these things may initially be very good he is bound to rebel against God
God does not care for the nature of the things; He only asks what directs him his own desire or the will of God?
God may want to lead a believer to do many works but because the motive is of the believers own desire God will immediately oppose this work
Although sometimes our desire may agree with the will of God, God will not let us walk according to it because it is still our desire
Even though some of our own desires may be the same as God's will, God does not like them because they came out of our self
If the believer wants to gain a real spiritual life, he must cooperate with God to put his own desire to death
We should learn to accept all the sufferings, afflictions, and lowly positions given to us by God in His arrangement
If we practically bear the cross in this way, we will see that the practical cross we bear will crucify our self-life shortly
He has many hopes, yet the Lord will not allow him to be successful in anything; rather, He causes all his hopes to be crushed
The believer may have many delights, but the Lord will cause him to lose all of his delights and have no way to gain them back
Almost nothing in the Lord's arrangements agrees with the thoughts of the believer; everything is like a beating rod
It is as if everything were dead; everything wants him to die, and everything wants him to lose the hope of life
At that moment he realizes that he cannot escape death and that he owes this death to God hence he submits himself to God and dies willingly
A believer may resist for a long time, but once he passes through death, everything is fine, and God accomplishes His purpose in him
He is willing to become whatever God desires of him; his desire is no longer contrary to God, and he no longer seeks anything other than God
In the past he had many desires, exhausting all of his wits, strength, schemes, devices, and methods to gain them
The believer becomes vexed, anxious, and angry because many outward things are not agreeable or in accordance with his desire
He knows that the heavenly Father will allow many unpleasant things to fall upon the believers so that they may be weaned from the world
He said we need to take His yoke, accept His restraint, and walk according to His will alone, not seeking after the freedom of the flesh
If the believer is willing to receive the cross of the Lord and fully submit to Him, he will see that the emotion will not be disturbed
He had many wild desires before, but he has learned how to die to his own desire and be satisfied with God's will alone
He does not seek after what he likes, not because he forces himself, but because the will of God has filled him
The meaning of satisfaction is that the believer has obtained all that he needs in God , and he considers God's will as the best
Once the Holy Spirit has worked deeply through the cross, a believer no longer loves anything according to himself
At this moment, not only does the believer not resist the Lord negatively, but he delights in what the Lord delights in positively
All those who are willing to accept the practical cross that God has given them will find themselves living a spiritual life without mixture
It normally comes after the experience of being freed from sin and before entering into the experience of an absolute spiritual life
Since the happiness which proceeds from a life of feeling is so satisfying, they find it difficult to part with this experience
A fire seems to burn in his heart, and he enjoys a kind of unspeakable happiness that makes him feel as though he were already in heaven
Something seems to stir in his heart, and it yields an unspeakably comfortable feeling as though he had seized the most valuable treasure
When a believer feels this way, he desires to be all the more quiet, for fear of losing his happiness among the crowd
He seems to have developed a keener sense of judgment which enables him to see the shortcomings of others even more
Such a believer tends to secretly feel sorry for others because he thinks they do not have his kind of experience
He considers his own happiness as an excellent thing and pities his brothers and sisters for not being able to comprehend it!
What grieves the believer the most is that in less than a month or two , the happiness which he most desires suddenly vanishes
In the past it seemed that other believers were lagging behind him spiritually; now he feels just like one of them
When he examines himself, he cannot find any particular sin; everything is generally the same as it was before
It seems that if his present condition caused the Lord to forsake him, why did his past condition not cause the Lord to forsake him?
Previously, he could continuously pray for several hours; now he can pray only for a few minutes, and even they are a strain
Previously, the more he read the more enjoyable it was; now the Holy Book seems like a field of stones that yields nothing
They often know that this is God's will, but they have fallen into such a grievous state that they do not care
Even though he loves his Lord and desires to be near Him very much, he does not have any feeling of the Lord's love
In his heart he secretly rebukes himself for being hypocritical and for putting on a good front despite his inward condition
If someone praises him, he feels quite shameful because others do not realize the great darkness he feels in his heart
When he sees how other believers are growing and how they have sweet fellowship with the Lord, he is very desirous
Daily he serves the Lord with the best of his ability in hope of maintaining his happiness and never failing again
His feeling of happiness disappears again, and he sinks back into a state of suffering, darkness, and dryness once more
In the beginning the Lord causes him to feel His love, presence, and happiness, but this feeling disappears after a while
When he feels happy, when he feels he loves the Lord, and when he feels the Lord's presence, he is just living by his feeling
He is just as soulish when he feels dry, sorrowful, and dark as he is when he feels nourished, happy, and bright
Today the experience of feeling is most commonly, but erroneously, regarded by believers as a spiritual experience
He thinks that he is in possession of the ascended life, without realizing that this is just something which he feels
When he feels the Lords presence he thinks he possesses the Lord when he does not feel His presence he thinks that the Lord has forsaken him
He thinks that he really loves the Lord when he senses a warm fire burning in his heart and feels that he loves the Lord very much
He does not realize that because he is still soulish, he is merely advancing in a spurt of emotional excitement
The effect of the emotion helps a soulish person go on; the power of the Holy Spirit helps a spiritual man go on
The more he learns, the deeper the lesson becomes and the more he realizes how filthy his life and nature are in the sight of God
God employs many ways of instructing the believer so that he may be brought to the place where he can know himself
Among God's many ways, one of the most important is by granting the believer a happy feeling and later withdrawing it
God wants the believer to know that he does not glorify God's name any more when he is full of happiness than he does when he is suffering
The Lord causes the believer to have different feelings so that he may learn how to overcome them and, thereby, overcome his environment
God does not want His children to vary their way of living according to the brightness or darkness of their feeling
If faithfulness, work, or supplication is called for, they should do it with the same fervency in happiness as well as in sorrow
If the believer cannot overcome different feelings in his life, he will not be able to overcome different environments
When a believer has no feeling, the extent to which he can live by his will is the extent of the reality in his living
We may say that after each period of living by the feeling, he reaches a further station in his spiritual journey
If his spirit is able to press on through the will, regardless of how he feels, he will observe real progress in his life
He is full of joy, light, and lightness, and he thinks he has possession of the perfect life he desired and sought after
Shortly thereafter, his new experience suddenly becomes obscure; the happiness and excitement he once felt disappear
In the absence of feelings, He wants the believer to use his will to do the same thing he did when he had the feeling
When the believer does this, he will eventually discover that what he lost in feeling has subconsciously become a part of his life
If we understand the significance of this experience which God gives us and walk according to His will, there is no danger at all
The sense of the spirit also has no way of developing, since intuition in the spirit is being replaced by feeling
Consequently, the will turns according to feeling, proceeding when a feeling is present and halting when it is not
What a pity that he remains unaware and still considers it as the peak of spiritual life and something that should be pursued!
When the believer is filled with happiness, does he truly love the Lord or does he love the feeling of happiness?
If we only love when the feeling is present but not when it is absent, perhaps we only love our feeling, not God
If he genuinely loves God, he should still love Him even when he is suffering through 'many waters and floods'
When a believer lives by feeling and not by the spirit through the will, there is another danger that he will be deceived by Satan
When the believer seeks to walk completely according to the spirit, Satan confuses him with different kinds of feeling
How much more opportunity does he have to apply his tricks to the believer who walks according to his feeling!
He thinks that he has been granted some marvelous experiences which definitely make him more spiritual than others
They are in this condition because they do not live in the spirit, preferring instead to live in their feeling!
After we have carefully considered a believer's life of feeling, we can find an underlying principle in this kind of experience
Although everything around faith may change, if the One in whom it believes has not changed, faith continues on
They feel sad, depressed, and discouraged to the point that they want to cease all the activities of their spiritual journey
Knowing that the work in this spiritual journey must go on, they should ignore all contradictory feelings and continue to press onward
A life of feeling draws a person to live apart from God Himself by causing him to be satisfied after obtaining a certain amount of happiness
Since he has already gained God, he is not made any happier because he feels happy, nor is he made bitter because he feels bitter
If the self is given a reason to be happy in one area, there is no living by faith in that area, only a living by feeling
They forget that living, acting, and hoping by their emotion and by their feeling of happiness is walking by sight and not by faith
We may think that the cross's most complete work is accomplished when we forsake outward, physical happiness and worldly pleasures
Little do we know that in God's work of eliminating our old creation, there remains an even deeper work of the cross for us
If a believer desires the joy which God gives him but dislikes the suffering He gives, he has not gone through the deeper work of the cross
If a believer seeks after Gods joy he merely desires that part of Gods will which makes him happy he does not desire the entire will of God
At this time, if the believer knows the will of God and does it, God will fill his heart with joy as he is doing His will
As soon as he begins to once again suffer for the Lord or do His will, he may expect the Lord's comfort and joy to help him
God knows that when He comforts a believer, he is very willing to suffer for Him; when God grants him happiness, he delights to do His will
Is he suffering for the sake of the Lord or for the sake of receiving the comfort which comes with the suffering?
God is asking him, 'If you do not receive any of My comfort, can you bear it simply because you are bearing it for My sake?
Through this the Lord reveals to us whether we are living for Him by faith or whether we are living for ourselves by feeling
We are not allowed to retreat, cease obeying, or delay our obeying just because we feel pained, uninterested, and discouraged
The believer must know that living for the Lord means not leaving any place for the self but willingly delivering the self fully to death
We feel as though we are walking through the valley of the shadow of death because of our fight with the enemy
Alas, not even mentioning the believers who do not do the will of God today, many who do His will do only that which interests them!
Many believers who have advanced in their spiritual journey have the experience of seemingly being rejected by God
To lose their all in the Lord, including that which causes the self to be happy, is truly a death too deep and a cross too heavy!
Believers are still regulated by their natural life because they think that what they see and feel is reliable
A little loss or a little gain becomes the cause of their sorrow or joy, and they no longer aim to go any higher or deeper
What a pity that many believers accomplish nothing in their lifetimes except the pursuit of a little feeling of happiness
Faithful believers those who have been brought by God into a real life of spirituality lead a life that is so much of God!
The need today is for believers to fully commit themselves into the hand of God without caring about how they feel
It means that although we have lost the feeling of happiness, the joy which we receive out of a pure faith will not be quenched
When a believer walks according to the spirit he does not fear the absence of any supportive feeling or the presence of any opposing feeling
A believer who lives by his feeling will come to realize that he was after a pleasant feeling in the beginning
To be led by the spirit more than anything else requires faith because the intuition's leading is often contrary to one's feeling
During periods of dryness it comes forth through the decision of the will and wants to walk according to the will of God
Our will expresses the opinion of our true self, whereas our feeling is just a reaction to an outward stimulus
It is valuable to God when we suffer and do not feel His comfort love help presence and joy and yet still decide to obey Him and do His will
Because they desire this kind of life, they also consecrate themselves fully to the Lord with the hope of obtaining this 'higher' life
Even when we feel good, without a heart which unconditionally obeys God, our spiritual life is at its lowest level
Even when we feel dry, if there is the willingness to obey God unto death, our spiritual life is at its highest level
If the will has already surrendered to God, it means that our 'self' has surrendered to God and is no longer the master
He considers his duties as worldly things which he, as a holy and victorious person, should not be concerned with
He is very desirous of a time and place to have fellowship with the Lord, but he detests his duties because they frustrate his happiness
He does not care for the need and welfare of others because he seeks after a time and place to fellowship with the Lord
Parents who bear this attitude fail to take good care of their children; likewise, slaves fail to serve their master faithfully
To them these things are worldly, and it is all right not to care about them since they are seeking after something more spiritual
Since he is not yet fully in union with God, he can only commune with God at a particular time and in a particular place
Believers should know that the highest life of a Christian can never contradict the duties of his human living
When we read the Epistles to the Romans, Colossians, and Ephesians, we can see how a believer must fulfill his human duties
If we are in union with God in all things, we know what our proper duties towards every person are and how to fulfill them
When God puts him to work in a field which is full of emotional and physical suffering, he feels sorry for himself and refuses to go on
It would be very difficult for God to gain true workers if we do not deliver our emotion and self-love fully to death
Because His work bears an eternal nature, it is difficult for those who live in time to perceive and understand
Those who live according to feeling cannot be included in this kind of work because there is nothing to please their feeling
What is comfortable about travailing by prayer in our soul for the saints, destroying and establishing by prayer?
Although it seems that God has deserted him and that there is no one to help him, he can still face the opposition alone
Now he knows that only Gods will is of any value whatever else he may naturally desire is not the highest nor do they match the highest life
Now the believer is living by the will ; his will is full of the strength of the spirit which rules over his emotion
All these only affect the outward man; it does not affect the inward man because there is a clear separation between our spirit and soul
No matter how much the soul suffers outwardly or is confused, our spirit remains peaceful and secure as though nothing has happened
When the believer's life reaches this stage of rest, he realizes that all the loss he suffered for the Lord before has been replaced
At that time, God caused him to experience sorrow and hardship because his soul-life was the mastermind in all things
Since he has lost the self and lost his soul-life, he can enjoy God's happiness in a proper position and within a proper boundary
He lives by faith, but he also lives by feeling; he walks according to the spirit, but he also walks according to the soul
Although God grants him peace, comfort, and joy, he no longer enjoys these things for the sake of satisfying his desire
From these verses we can see that the mind of man is a battlefield because this is where evil spirits war with God
They also utilize the imprisoned mind to transmit poison to others, and cause them to rise up in rebellion against God
One thing is certain: reasonings that lift themselves up against the knowledge of God are the strongholds of the enemy
Since our thoughts have such an 'open-door policy' with the authority of darkness, we should know how to guard our thoughts
Because man is at enmity with God in the mind, God wants man's mind to have a change before He can give life to man
God wants man first to have a change of mind before he receives a new heart because the mind is so united with the devil
We must realize that evil spirits of Satan pay special attention to our minds and that they always attack us in our minds
In the same manner, evil spirits want to attack our mind first, not our heart, with the purpose of corrupting us from a faith in simplicity
Before we believed, the mind was their stronghold; even now there are still many places that are not yet overthrown
She was enchanted by the power of his subtlety to the point that her mind lost its rationality, thereby becoming trapped
Otherwise, they will have a way to tempt and to deceive his mind, and will cause his will to lose its power of decision
Some will preach 'another Jesus,' causing them to 'receive a different spirit' and accept 'a different gospel'
Many believers truly have a tender regard in their hearts for all of God's children, yet their minds are full of ideals, opinions, and goals
They only want their kind of truth and completely reject anything else which does not agree with their prejudices
Although they have heard many truths, they can never remember them; neither can they put them into practice or spread them to others
If believers could differentiate between the renewing of the heart and the renewing of the head, they would not be misled to trust in man
We must realize that even though a person's words and deeds are very holy, his thoughts are not necessarily entirely spiritual
If the mind is not renewed, a believer's life will not be balanced; it will be almost impossible to do any work
It is equally important for a believer's mind to be renewed and enlarged and increase in strength so that it becomes strong
Besides being a little better than others in his living, he has no other usefulness, and he cannot be entrusted with anything
Countless numbers of God's children have become narrow, obstinate, hard, and even defiled through the negligence of their minds
They find themselves unknowingly committing many 'indiscreet' mistakes, without ever bothering to learn the reason for committing them
The thoughts in the mind are no longer his own thoughts, but the work of another 'person' who is utilizing his thoughts against his will
If a believer does not choose to think, the thoughts that are in his mind are no longer his; they belong to evil spirits
Their intention is to inject their thoughts into the mind of the believer, fooling him into thinking that they are his own thoughts
His mind is like a thinking machine, which has been 'turned on' by an external force, thinking continually and uncontrollably
In an unstoppable train of thought, it is no longer the mind grasping a matter, but a matter grasping the mind!
Many times a believer wants to drop a matter, but an external force seems to remind him in his mind all the time
God never interjects His thoughts suddenly into mans thoughts and He never cuts off the work of mans mind suddenly or robs him of anything
Sudden thoughts and sudden forgetfulness are beyond the control of our will and beyond the course of natural events
If a believer examines all the phenomena of his mind this way, he will not be ignorant of the reasons for his symptoms
They are able to work not only from the outside, as from one man to another man, but they are able to operate within man
They also begin from the mind and work their way into man's will because the mind and the will are also closely connected
The way they move is by stealthily and secretly putting their favorite thoughts into man's mind in order to accomplish their goal
The Bible clearly teaches that the authority of darkness can give thoughts to man as well as steal thoughts away from man
John 13:2 says, 'The devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray Him'
Parts or the whole of man's mind have already isolated themselves from man's sovereign rule and fallen into the hands of evil spirits
In whatever aspect the believers give place to evil spirits, that aspect will not thereafter obey man's own will
When the believers give any ground in their minds to evil spirits, they have lost their sovereignty over their own minds
The minds of the believers are attacked by evil spirits because the believers have given place to evil spirits in their minds
Believers are prone to give more place in the mind to evil spirits because the mind is related to evil spirits in such a special way
We should remember that man's mind is of man; if evil spirits do not have man's consent, they cannot use his mind
If man does not volunteer intentionally or unintentionally to hand over the mind to evil spirits, they cannot infringe on man's freedom
The problem today is that even though many believers exercise their own will to resist, temptations still do not stop
After a believer has indeed yielded to evil spirits, his mind will inevitably be filled with the works of evil spirits
Whenever believers give ground in their minds to evil spirits, the evil spirits will work in the believers' minds
If the mind is not renewed, even if a person is regenerated in his spirit, evil spirits will still have a chance to work
If a believer is fleshly, they will generate many thoughts through his mind which are similar to his character and condition
If there is only this kind of ground given without the passivity spoken of below the mind and memory will still not be weakened too severely
In addition to sin, there are many other improper thoughts that can become a base of operation for evil spirits
They also cause the believers to be full of prejudice, rebel against God's truth, and believe in many heresies
Believers seldom realize that any time they accept the lies from evil spirits, they give place to evil spirits
Though this allowance is the result of our being deceived it has nevertheless given sufficient ground to evil spirits to continue their work
As a result, prejudice develops in their heart, and they begin to have ideas about what spiritual teachings should be like
Evil spirits will seize this opportunity and give the believers what they misunderstand and what they think they know
If the believers will does not oppose it or if it agrees with it evil spirits will gain ground and work on the believer as much as they will
Evil spirits will do this either by deceptions or force; they will cause the believer's mind to become emptiness
Many believers do not understand that God does not want man to be passive, but to co-labor with Him in an active way
Of course, such work is always camouflaged on the outside so that believers do not realize that evil spirits are working
Passivity of the mind is caused by misunderstanding the meaning of consecration to God and obeying the Holy Spirit
We have said emphatically before that the right way to follow God's leading is to depend on the intuition and not on the mind
If we regard the mind as an organ for direct fellowship with God and for receiving revelation, we are greatly wrong
We still need the mind to examine and see if our feeling proceeds from the intuition or if it is a counterfeit of our own emotions
If this exercise is from fleshly thoughts and feelings, repeated examination will only cause the conscience to protest
The mind should not take the lead, but the mind is definitely needed in examining every kind of leading to see if it is from God
God wants believers to know what they are doing when they obey Him; He does not want to have senseless and blind obedience
He does not want them to hear or feel something, presume that they are clear about God's will, and then act accordingly
A lazy person does not want to bear any responsibility for himself; he just wants to passively allow God to use him or his members
They may receive some supernatural leading and may follow blindly without examining with their minds whether this leading is from God
When man does not use his own mind, God will not use his mind either, because doing so would contradict the principle of God's work
These people tell us that in order to be possessed by a demon, which they call a god, their will must be completely void of resistance
When this state is reached little by little the mouth no longer moves according to the persons own will and the whole body begins to shiver
With those who communicate with demons, the methods by which they become possessed may be different in outward respects
Upon examining the principle, we can find that the methods are all done through the mind becoming empty and the will becoming passive
The so-called modern-day hypnotism, which disguises itself under the name of science, and religious and transcendental meditation, etc
Although in name they are for the good of mankind, the methods of 'concentration,' 'mental focus,' 'yoga,' 'meditation,' etc
Suddenly, they will begin to experience strange things, such as speaking in tongues, seeing visions, feeling joyful, etc
Finally, some external force will take over his throat and turn his jaws to utter things which are incomprehensible to him
They do not realize that this is the deception of evil spirits, who will resort to any means to gain the believers
By then, because of the believers' pride, laziness, and foolishness, most will not want to examine the kind of spirit they have received
One thing is certain : there is a basic difference between the work of evil spirits and the work of the Holy Spirit
If he initially fulfilled the conditions for the working of the Holy Spirit, what he has received must be from God
What are the basic differences between the conditions for the Holy Spirit to work and the conditions for evil spirits to work?
That require the complete cessation of the mind's function or that are received when the believer's mind stops functioning are not from God
We should realize that all supernatural revelations that are of the authority of darkness require the suspension of the function of the mind
If something is from God, both the capacities and faculties of the mind can still be active and not suffer any hindrance
The so-called supernatural revelations today all require that the recipient's mind be passive, some totally, some partially
Is it not true that they have completely lost control of themselves and are completely ignorant of what they are doing?
Is it not true that the spirits of the prophets are not subject to the prophets, and instead that the prophets are subject to the spirits?
Now we want to briefly see the difference between the work of the Holy Spirit and the work of evil spirits with respect to natural things
Everything that comes from evil spirits, whether supernatural or natural, always causes the believer to lose the proper use of the mind
It is very pitiful that believers do not know the fundamental difference between the work of evil spirits and the work of the Holy Spirit
The believer may use his will to oppose them, but still find that he cannot rid himself of the thoughts he does not want
Sometimes a sudden flash of thought comes into a believer's mind and causes him to understand, know, or invent some special thing
The believers should be on the alert so that evil spirits do not give them these teachings in their passive mind
When a believer's mind is passive, evil spirits are most likely to inject all kinds of nonsensical thoughts into him
Because he does not use the reasoning and the mind he does not know how these thoughts damage the spiritual life and how ridiculous they are
When the meeting is over, the audience wakes up as if from a dream and finds that they have not received any practical help in life
Since the believer has reserved some ground in his mind for evil spirits, they can give him any thoughts they wish
If the believer knows to resist them and check the source of these thoughts, there will not be so many divisions
The believer still thinks that it is his own thinking and does not know that evil spirits are also able to put thoughts into his mind
Evil spirits are not only able to inject thoughts into the believer's mind, but they can also form different kinds of pictures in his mind
Past experiences, future predictions, and many other things are always lingering before his eyes in spite of the opposition of his will
A believer should realize that everything that is not produced by his own mind is given to him by supernatural spirits
If a believer's mind is open to evil spirits, many of his dreams at night are probably the 'pictures' he obtained during the day in disguise
If a believer wants to check if his dream is from evil spirits, he only needs to ask, 'Has my mind been passive during the day'?
Dreams that come from evil spirits are all strange vain false foolish and cause people to become elated stupefied confused and irrational
The evil spirits can give a believer many strange dreams, some of which are very good, because his mind is passive
Sleep does not seem to increase his vigor, because while he is sleeping, evil spirits are affecting his whole being through the passive mind
If a believer single-mindedly rejects the evil spirits' work both during the day and night, he will soon be free
When night comes even though he is very tired the mind will not rest as if it is a thinking machine which is very active and refuses to stop
Before his mind can rest and he can go to sleep, he can only wait for a certain kind of power within himself to stop him from thinking
After a person continuously has this kind of experience for several nights he will regard sleeping bed and the night as something dreadful
When thoughts are racing in the believer's mind at night, he should ask himself, 'Where do these thoughts come from?
Because of the attack of evil spirits, many believers lose their original power of memory and often have the phenomenon of forgetfulness
In such a condition, the believer finds himself jotting down all kinds of 'memos,' and becomes a slave to his notebooks
Other than the above-mentioned matters, there are many things which have not transpired long ago, which the believers have paid attention to
Evil spirits are very capable at taking hold of certain of our nerves at critical hours and making us forget what we should have remembered
Countless numbers of believers have suffered considerable hardships as a result of the attacks of evil spirits in this area
At many critical junctures, when the mind should be working very well, it suddenly becomes muddled and cannot remember anything
According to the experience of believers a variation in the power of concentration mainly comes as a result of the evil spirits distraction
If they try to concentrate on one thing for a few minutes, they find their thoughts flying all over the place instead
At such moments, evil spirits either cause their minds to stop functioning or force them to think about something else
Before he can understand what the other party is saying, he must wrinkle his forehead in order to try to hear the words
Often he does not understand the very obvious meaning of the other party, or he misunderstands the teachings given to him by the other party
Since the voices within are closer than the voices without, the believer's ears will seem to be blocked from hearing the voices without
How many times do believers think that they have become 'absent-minded,' when in fact their hearts have just been captured by evil spirits
Because of evil spirits' disturbance in the minds of the believers, they shake their heads, as if to shake out the undesirable things
If they say something, they have to say it loudly in order to let their own minds hear what they are saying and to leave an impression
They cannot concentrate their thoughts, and they have to do these things before their minds can receive a little impression or know anything
When this happens, their minds have almost completely sunk into the evil spirits' hands, and they cannot make decisions anymore
It seems that too many voices are inside already; the agenda is already full, and their thoughts are involuntarily pushed out
It seems as if something is missing and a kind of dizzy feeling looms over him making it impossible for him to produce anything from within
For him to go steadily and diligently forward with his work day by day is like asking him to sacrifice his life
Time is wasted; he passes his days in the absence of any thought, imagination, reasoning, understanding, or even the mind itself
After the mind has suffered such an attack, the will is spontaneously affected because the mind is the light of the will
In this way, the believer passively allows his environment to toss him about, and he cannot choose anything himself
Nothing that he does seems possible; it seems as if his life is filled with difficulty and nothing can satisfy him
It seems that they are already accustomed to worrying and have no more strength to pull themselves out of their situation
It seems that he even cannot see the sun and does not know the truth; it even seems that he cannot exercise his own reasoning
People who work with him or who are together with him consider these instant changes as a characteristic of his unstable character
In many conversations, when the tone suddenly changes, we can detect the work of evil spirits in the minds of men
The believer himself may hate such a vacillating life, but he is not his own person and has no way to stabilize himself
The tides of thought in their minds are like rising winds and surging clouds that cannot be stopped by the words of others
When many believers are chatting, joking, and slandering behind the backs of others, it seems as if they cannot control their own tongues
Even when they know what they are talking about, they often do not know how to stop or restrict their unprofitable words
Many words that the mind has not thought through and that the will has not decided to say, nevertheless, are spoken
In his view, the one who is telling him something is very foolish and can never understand what he understands
Since his mind has become completely passive, he does not know how to use his own reasoning to deduce, differentiate, or judge anymore
He indiscriminately takes in every thought that evil spirits inject into him, and considers them to be the most perfect thoughts
In his view, these voices are speaking laws to him, and no one can make him use his reasoning to check the source of these voices
If he has received any thoughts, voices, or teachings, he will think that he can never be mistaken and is absolutely secure
Once he believes that God is leading him, it is as if his brain becomes sealed by a tight seal and cannot be changed again
Since he does not use his own reasoning, he is subject to any deception by evil spirits and is completely ignorant of it himself
If the mind is passive, a believer can be reading a book with his eyes, but nothing enters his mind, and nothing is retained in his memory
When he talks with people, his eyes wander around in all directions, jump up and down, or change direction abruptly
At other times, he fixes his gaze on the faces of others as if some unknown power is keeping his eyes from moving away
When the mind is passive, our eyes are very easily dimmed; they see strange things which they were never asked to see
When he discovers any act in his mind that is independent from his will, he should realize that he is being attacked by evil spirits
When the mind of a believer has fallen into the condition mentioned in the preceding chapter, he should seek the way of deliverance
In the preceding chapter we could only briefly discuss the general phenomena and could not point out everyone's condition
When a believer sees that his own mind has any of the conditions mentioned in the preceding chapter, he should be on the alert
After reading the lesson in the preceding chapter most believers will wonder why they did not pay any attention to the torture in their mind
He always seems to have considerable knowledge about other things, but concerning his own mind, he seems to know nothing
When the believer's eyes are opened to see his own condition, he naturally wants to seek the way of deliverance
Little does he know that the real reason is his passivity; his mind has become blank and occupied by evil spirits
If there is a supernatural cause mixed in with it , the man will not be restored even when the natural cause is eliminated
All the cases, involving a person who is not restored when the natural causes are eliminated, are due to a mixture with supernatural causes
If you do not try to deal with the supernatural causes, no cure will be effective no matter how much you eliminate the natural causes
Otherwise, if he misinterprets mistaking the supernatural for the natural evil spirits will gain much more ground
What must be guarded against the most is the evil spirits' utilizing a believer to work for them in order to protect their work in him!
In this way, he becomes an accomplice of evil spirits and helps preserve their ground even when he himself knows that he is being troubled
A reluctance to examine and a complacency and refusal to relinquish one's 'spiritual' experience is a big obstacle to deliverance
He should know that he dislikes hearing about the devil and his work because the devil's work is already in his mind
Is this not the same as those who have committed certain sins, and who are afraid when others mention the same sin?
When a believer says these words, in the depth of his heart, he is afraid that his real condition will be exposed
When the believer is enlightened and begins to seek freedom, evil spirits will pour out many accusations in his mind
He will see that repeated resolutions are not enough and that methods of training the mind or memory will not enable him to gain freedom
Since his mind has been chained by supernatural powers, weapons of the flesh cannot drive them out or destroy them
He will also see that evil spirits have utilized many means through his mind to torment him and prevent him from acting to regain the ground
He will see that his mind is truly the stronghold of the enemy and that he has never fully had control over it
The believer must choose and see whether he wants to fully consecrate to God or allow his mind to become the leasing ground of Satan
We have previously mentioned that evil spirits are able to work in the mind of the believer because he has given them the ground
The believer must carefully examine what kind of ground he has given to evil spirits and what has led him to his present condition
If he realizes in which aspect or aspects he has given ground to the evil spirits, he should regain the ground that he has given to them
After many believers have learned the teaching in Romans 6, they often think that they are completely freed from the fleshly mind
After reckoning 'yourselves to be dead to sin' , believers should 'not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body'
The mind must be renewed completely because, no matter how little remains of the fleshly mind, it is still enmity against God
We know that our old man has been crucified with the Lord but these verses advise that we should put off in order for our mind to be renewed
They still apply their former mind, reasoning, way of thinking, and prejudice to examine, receive, or preach spiritual truths
Just as God hates man to do His work with his own strength, He also hates man to think His truth with his own mind
Even though God wants to renew the mind of the believer, the believer may continue daily to think according to the flesh
All that are not of God and contradictory to God's truth should be 'squeezed out' from the mind and abandoned completely
The apostle tells us that the unrenewed mind is full of 'reasonings' and all kinds of imaginations that rise up against the knowledge of God
He should examine why his mind is so confused and why he has prejudicial thoughts, rebellious thoughts, and angry thoughts
Every thought must be examined in order that every thought issuing from the old creation would be discovered and eliminated
If we do not fight, we cannot break through these thoughts one by one, because the mind is the stronghold of evil spirits
When a believer carries out an examination in the light of God, he will see that in the past he accepted countless lies from evil spirits
Sometimes he misunderstood God's truth by believing in the lies of evil spirits which resulted in a wrong attitude and behavior
He should examine where the sufferings have come from, which he is presently undergoing, mentally, physically and environmentally
Is the suffering related to him believing in certain words from evil spirits or is it related to wrong behavior that results from their lies
Neither do they want the believer to know which one of his present conditions is caused by which lies he has believed in
Experientially, the believer will see that sometimes it takes several months before he is able to understand one lie of evil spirits
He should first reject all the ground of the evil spirits in his will and then carefully overthrow their lies one by one
If the believer wants to be recovered back to the original condition, he should know what the 'original' condition is
The believer should know that there is a normalcy, an original condition from where he fell when he was deceived by evil spirits
A believer should pay attention to whether his condition today is different than before, and whether his condition is much worse than before
He should not want to continue with his present condition; rather, he should want to be recovered to his former condition
After asking these and similar questions, the believer will know if he has lost his normal condition and if he has been passive or attacked
To understand his own normal condition, the believer must first acknowledge and believe that he has a normal condition
After he finds out the best period of his life, he should take the conditions of that period as his normal condition
When a believer compares his present condition to his former condition, he will know whether he is already 'far off'
They will say to the believer, 'You are already old, and you cannot expect your mind to be as strong as when you were young
If the believer is deceived or passive, then excuses that blame everything on natural causes are absolutely untrustworthy
After the believer realizes his own normal condition, his most important job is to fight to return to his normal condition
He should know that evil spirits will guard the ground that they have gained in the same way that worldly kings guard their territories
The believer should realize that it requires effort to regain the lost ground, even though it is very easy to surrender it
He should choose to use his own mind and no longer allow external forces to instigate, impart revelation to, utilize, and press his mind
If possible, he should make his own decisions in everything and not passively wait on others and the environment
He should give up the crutch and not use worldly things and methods to substitute for the capacity of his mind
Because the believer's mind has been passive for a long time, it takes time to fight back to the position of freedom
Before he is free, many of the thoughts in his mind are not his own; they belong to the evil spirits in his mind
Otherwise, before the old ground is regained completely, new ground will be given unknowingly and ignorantly to the evil spirits
Whatever thoughts the evil spirits have suggested in his mind, the believer must answer specifically with words in the Scripture
Alternatively, if he recognizes that these are assuredly from evil spirits, he can tell them, 'These are your lies
He must stand on Romans 6:11 and believe that he is already dead to sin and made alive unto God in Christ Jesus
Every time he wants to reject the evil spirits and exercise his mind, he must depend completely on the accomplishment of the cross
The believer will see that his own mind, memory, imagination and reasons gradually are able to act on their own and be used
To regain the ground lost to passivity and the ground given to the lies will merely restore the believer to his original condition
Renewing not only restores one to his original condition, but brings him to a place that is higher than the 'point of origin'
A believer knows all the things of himself through the mind, but it is through his spirit that he knows the things of God
Because both the spirit and the mind are the faculties of 'knowledge,' their relationship is closer than anything else
The Bible tells us clearly about the work of mutual assistance and reliance that exists between the mind and the spirit
Now we have to pay attention to how the revelation received through the intuition of the spirit goes along with our mind
As soon as an assignment comes, the spirit knows it in the twinkling of an eye and causes the mind to understand
Before the spirit of a believer has reached the highest position, the mind is usually against the leading of the spirit
When the spirit of a believer is blocked by evil spirits, he will sense that the path of his thoughts are darkened
His thoughts will be confused, his mind will be disorganized, and his whole being will be unable to concentrate
If the mind is blocked, the spirit cannot be opened, and the Holy Spirit will not be able to flow from our spirit to others
We need the mind to 'interpret' the notions of our intuition so that the Holy Spirit can express His intention through us
If our mind is narrow and foolish, the Holy Spirit will not be able to fellowship with the believer according to His intention
For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit
To have the mind searching the things of the Spirit and the spirit governing the mind is the meaning of walking according to the spirit
A man who walks 'according to the spirit' is just one who minds 'the things of the Spirit' and whose mind is 'set on the spirit'
For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit'
If the mind is minding the flesh we will walk according to the flesh if the mind is minding the Spirit we will walk according to the spirit
Minding the things of the Spirit will cause us to become spiritual men; minding the things of the flesh will cause us to become fleshly men
At other times our spirit is not wrong, but our mind is wrong, and we still are not able to walk according to the spirit
If we are not constantly minding the things of the spirit, how can we know the intention of the spirit and walk after it?
Believers have to know the process through which the truth is translated into life before they see the importance of an opened mind
Experienced believers can all testify to the importance of an opened mind with regard to the revelation of the truth
Many times we do not have understanding because we do not have an opened mind, not because the truth is not preached to us
Sometimes God has to wait for many years before He can cause us to remove all the hindrances and receive His truth
After a while the light of the spirit comes in and the believer seems to understand everything and sees the intrinsic content of the truth
After the seed of a thought has been planted, we do not know when it will grow, but sooner or later it will grow
If we let a sinful thought remain in our head without getting rid of it, some time later, even years later, it will become a sinful act
He should be a spiritual person with a full consciousness, not allowing his thoughts to remain stagnant or become loose
Is his behavior fully according to the spirit and fully according to God's timing, or is there still something from the self?
Believers have to awaken to the fact that any knowledge, secured by the mind alone, provides a way for the devil to work
Believers should discard all of their self-deceiving thoughts and realize the position that God has arranged for them in the Body of Christ
We need to read the Scripture more and memorize the Scripture more so that we do not have to search the Bible in times of urgent need
We should ask God to keep us from coming up with any special doctrines according to our old concepts, which would divide the church of God
We should ask God to keep us from using the new life to sustain a wrong thought or teachings that proceed from such thoughts
Our willingness or unwillingness, our wanting or not wanting, and our deciding or not deciding are all the functions of our will
There are others who think that 'religion' should fit in with reason , and that it should not be too slanted toward the emotion
If all our experiences do not bring us to the point where we willingly receive all the will of God, they are but very shallow
In speaking about man and man's will, we should always keep in mind that, as human beings, we have a free will
God put the responsibility of eating or not eating on man and allowed man to choose according to his free will
As we will see later, God's work never goes against this principle, even though the work of evil spirits' does
On the one hand, there was the holy, good will of God; on the other hand, there was the filthy, rebellious will of Satan
Man's will became the slave of the devil after the fall because he exercised his own will to choose the devil's will
Even if man wants to seek after God, his activities remain in the realm of the flesh; they have no spiritual value
Unless man receives God's new life and serves God in this new life, his activities are of the flesh no matter how he serves
Believers think that there is nothing better than a man who is trying to be saved, seek the way of life, and be a good disciple of Christ
If we understand the meaning of these verses, we will understand what God requires of us in our Christian life
One way is for man to consider himself as the source of initiation; the other is to place himself in a receiving position
Even if we are pursuing after something as wonderful and important as salvation, it will still be rejected by God
If we do not learn the principles for our living from the very first step of salvation, we will have endless failures afterwards
Saying that God wants to bring man back to Himself is the same as saying that God wants to bring man's will back to His own will
When God, through the Holy Spirit, causes a man to be convicted of sin, He causes him to realize that he has nothing to say
A sinner's believing and receiving are nothing other than being one who 'wills take the water of life,' resulting in salvation
A sinners objection and resistance are nothing other than being one who is not willing to come to that may have life resulting in perdition
If the will submits, it becomes a part of this new life; if it opposes, it becomes a strong enemy to this new life
Any way of salvation that does not have the goal of saving man from himself and into union with God is not genuine
Everything that belongs to the creature must go; the creatures should only enjoy all that the Creator is in the Creator Himself
If we do not lose the intentions and experiences that are for ourselves, our spiritual life will suffer great loss
Although we cannot answer the question one hundred percent accurately it may be more or less accurate to say that the self is the selfwill
Except for the work done in man by the grace of God, all that man has, whether he is a sinner or a saint, is completely opposed to God
The spirit is not sufficient to represent the whole being, because the spirit is the part where man has fellowship with God
The body is not sufficient to represent the whole being either, as it is the part where man contacts the world
If the will that governs our entire being is in complete union with God, our entire being will be totally submissive under God's hand
Since our will is the most important part, after regeneration, God daily is seeking the union of our will with His will
If our will is not fully one with God it means that salvation is not fully accomplished because man himself is still not in harmony with God
Little do they know that God's demands are not related to how man feels or what he thinks; He wants man's will to be united with Him
He desires to see a believer wholeheartedly seeking after what He wants and willingly obeying all that He says
If a believer does not resolve in his will to go all the way to finish God's course, whatever he does is useless
In the past all of our works were centered upon the self, and all of our activities were initiated by the self
God applies His hand heavily upon the believers to crush, break, and bind them so that their will can no longer be hardened before Him
In order for God to bring us to this point, He has to use the environment; He causes us to encounter many frustrations
He eventually causes them to lose the happiness and zeal in their feeling, as well as His presence and sympathy
God wants the believers to realize that He saved them, not for the purpose that they would enjoy anything, but for His will
Whether there is gain or loss happiness or dryness the feeling of Gods presence or forsaking believers should always be mindful of Gods will
Believers must see that their believing in the Lord, while living on earth, is not for themselves, but for the will of God
One step is for God to subdue the activities of our will; the other step is for God to subdue the life of our will
A submissive will merely stops its own activities, but a harmonious will is one with God and is of the same heart as God
Submission to God is good, but when grace has completely overcome the natural disposition, the believer will be in complete harmony with God
Who does not want to have gold, silver, honor, freedom, happiness, convenience, high position and a little of whatever?
Although the will has been broken and no longer has the strength to resist God, it has not reached the point of being one with God
The two conditions of the will may be illustrated by the examples of Lot's wife, the Israelites' coming out of Egypt, and the prophet Balaam
It is not a matter of man's tendency or a matter of the nature of things; it is a matter of what God's will is
We seek after God's will to the extent that we lose our soul-life and to the extent that our will takes God as its center
He must be willing to accept the strength, wisdom, goodness, righteousness, and work that is from God as his own
When the soul-life is consumed, habits, hobbies, desires, and cravings are broken one by one, and nothing opposes God anymore
Because of ignorance, Satan and his evil spirits are given the greatest advantage, and the church of God experiences the greatest suffering
They are still proud and boastful of their familiarity with the Scriptures and the abundance of their experiences
God's children are very unclear that evil spirits can change their appearance and attach themselves to the believers' bodies
After a believer understands the meaning, he will realize that it is possible for Christians to be possessed by demons
Being demon-possessed,' or simply 'being possessed,' means that evil spirits have attached themselves to the whole or part of man's body
As long as they have a footing, no matter how small it may be, they can keep on working until they gain the entire being
They explain their experiences in this way because these experiences do not outwardly look like they are from evil spirits
As long as a person fulfills the condition required by the law, he will immediately experience the activities of evil spirits
No one has ever put himself into a fire without getting burned, and no one has ever submerged himself into water without getting drowned
As long as one fulfills the condition that evil spirits need to attach to him, they will attach themselves to him
It does not matter if you are a Christian or not; if you fulfill the condition for evil spirits to work, they will work
Similarly he cannot fulfill the condition for evil spirits to work and say that he will not be possessed by demons because he is a Christian
Whether this place is given by a heathen or by a Christian, demons will attach themselves to that person just the same
Whatever in man allows evil spirits a spot to attack, an opportunity to invade, a footing to stand on, can be called a 'place'
If a believer is possessed by evil spirits as a result of committing some sin, he should specifically forsake that sin
Otherwise, he will see the ground that he has given to the evil spirits gradually increase and not stop until his whole being is possessed
Once the place is given, a person cannot help but be possessed; once he is possessed, he cannot help but suffer
In this way he falls into passivity and allows evil spirits to deceive him and attach themselves to the passive members of his body
The believer thinks he must be very passive before he can truly submit to God and before he can be truly in union with God in his will
God delights to see man reaching the highest level of attainment as a creature, which is the total freedom of the will
Though God is the Lord of the universe, He delights in being limited and does not infringe upon man's free will
Just as man 'wants' a good thing and God accomplishes this for him, if man 'wants' an evil thing, evil spirits accomplish this for him
Evil spirits know if a believer is fully submissive to God and willing to pay the price to follow Him to the end
They deceive the believer by counterfeiting God Himself, by counterfeiting God's voice, God's work, and God's presence
If the activity of evil spirits is not present in a passive person, his passivity will merely result in laziness and inactivity
When he falls into passivity and becomes demonpossessed he cannot become active again even if he wants to that is even if his will wants to
Satan wants man's will to be wholly passive; he wants man to stop all activities and allow his evil spirits to act on his behalf
Satan wants man to stop all of his activities even the function of the soul because he wants to act on behalf of man
It is a very dreadful thing that believers do not understand the principle of God being in man and working through man
Today there is a wrong teaching that says one should entrust everything to God and allow Him to do everything for him
Because the believers are so ignorant, they are deceived by the power of darkness and unconsciously taken in by Satan's deceit
If the believer knows the truth, knows how to work with God, and knows the rules of God's working, he will not accept Satan's lies
When he is deceived by evil spirits, he thinks that his entire being should be passive in order for God to live and work through him
As soon as the believer falls into passivity, that is, after he gives place to evil spirits, the danger cannot be overstated
Everything that befalls him becomes Gods will and Gods ordering he silently accepts them because he thinks that they are given to him by God
He cannot make any decision regarding many things that he ought to do and cannot take the initiative in these things
He dreads the thought of having a discussion on any matter because his passive will is not able to bear such a heavy responsibility
He must speak aloud to help himself in his thoughts and use a hundred other 'crutches' that he invents to support him through the day
Eventually, he finds that his feelings are gradually becoming numb and that he has unconsciously acquired many strange desires and habits
When he does anything, he tries to give up the partial or whole use of his mind, will, reasoning, and imagination
In his ignorance, the believer fails to realize that these symptoms of sickness come from passivity and demon- possession
Little does he realize that these symptoms are the lies of evil spirits, the purpose of which is to deceive him more
He thinks that these things are innate, natural, and dispositional, and does not realize that they are the work of evil spirits
At this time, the believer becomes a caged bird, and the evil spirits are like naughty children, teasing him as much as they desire
We have already seen how the believer does not have the strength to make decisions and that he has to rely on external forces to support him
If the believer tries to use his faculties in this condition, it only gives evil spirits an opportunity to express themselves through him
The believer does not realize the real situation; he considers these to be truly God's revelations and in accord with God's will
Evil spirits gladly help man not to think or use his will but to walk foolishly according to outward revelation
One thing should be noted: 'To whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, his slaves you are whom you obey'
When the believer falls into passivity, he thinks that he does not need to move and that God will move for him
In a person who is seriously possessed by demons, we can clearly see the characteristic of a 'double personality'
His mouth will speak words that he does not know or scarcely knows, and his voice will seem to belong to another person
In addition to his own person, there is another person within him who employs the various faculties of his soul and body
When demons are manifested, they nearly take over everything; all the activities belong to them, and man's own personality is not active
Consequently, after the demons depart, many do not know what they did, spoke, or expressed when the demons were there
They are not discerning and assume that since they can contact God these manifestations must be from the Holy Spirit
The believer has the Holy Spirit dwelling in his spirit, yet at the same time his body is possessed by evil spirits
One thing is certain: a life that is truly filled with the Holy Spirit will never have an experience of a double personality
Many unexpected words, behaviors, and attitudes may proceed out of him without the consent of his will, which he finds unable to control
A demon-possessed believer is one whose own will is suppressed and over whom the will of the evil spirits reign
They will cause him to see visions, laugh wildly, sing loudly, cry sorrowfully, or feel a kind of numb happiness surging through his body
Because many of the things they do are spiritual and of God, believers are afraid to reject what Satan puts behind them later
The believers must learn how to discern and prove all things; otherwise, they will be infected by workers with double personalities
We should not have a misconception that believers who are deceived by evil spirits are very defiled, degenerate, and sinful
We need to realize that these believers have completely consecrated themselves to God and are actually more advanced than ordinary believers
Because they have wholly consecrated themselves to the Lord but do not know how to cooperate with God, they fall into passivity
Little do they know that in order to receive God's protection, one must fulfill the condition for being protected by God
Little do they know that the people who are most easily deceived in the world are those who have a pure motive
Or they presume that they will not be deceived because they are wholly consecrated to the Lord and have acquired many spiritual experiences
We have already seen that passivity is the reason for being possessed by demons, but ignorance is the reason for being passive
We should firmly bear in mind the principle that the working of evil spirits differs from that of the Holy Spirit
They assume that they should lose their personality that they should have no more will and selfpower and that their I should die completely
They hand their 'self-consciousness' over to death and try to die to the point that they do not feel anything but the presence of God
Every time they sense that they have a desire, lack, need, interest, or feeling, they single-mindedly deal with it and put it to death
He does not intend to annihilate the various functions of our being, nor does He want our entire being to fall into passivity
After the believer dies in this way evil spirits cause him to have no feeling and make him ignorant of the need for any feelings of his own
When he contacts others, they feel that he is like a sculpture of iron or stone; he seems to have no sensing organs at all
Even though he has no 'self-consciousness,' when others mistreat him slightly, he is very prone to misunderstand and feel hurt
Little does he know that 'the lack of consciousness' is both the condition as well as the consequence of evil spirits possessing him
We must remember that what we commonly know as dying to self is the dying to the life power opinion and activity of the self outside of God
Since God operates to will, he need not exercise his will; all he has to do is allow another will to come upon him and use him
We must see the difference between God 'willing' in place of us and our cooperation with God through the exercise of our will
When a believer is deceived, he may think at that time that he has done everything, spoken every word, and thought every idea
There are many believers who have fallen into passivity and possession because of their ignorance of the work of the Holy Spirit
In practice, some pray through the night in their house and fast for a long time, 'waiting to receive their personal Pentecost'
Some meetings change to 'waiting meetings' as soon as the sermon is over, so that those who want to seek for the Holy Spirit can wait
After Pentecost, whenever we read about the believers being filled with the Holy Spirit, they were filled immediately
Today's practice of 'waiting for the Holy Spirit' is not scriptural, because this practice is entirely passive
At this time, all the prayers, promises, and faith offered to the Holy Spirit are actually offered to evil spirits
A casual glance at this word does not seem to reveal anything of importance, yet the spiritual relationship it implies is very crucial
We cannot expect the Holy Spirit to think through our mind, feel through our emotions, and propose through our will
Rather, the Holy Spirit manifests His will in the intuition so that the believer himself thinks, feels, and proposes according to His will
Many believers assume that they have to offer their mind to the Holy Spirit and allow Him to think from within them
Besides working in man's spirit, that is, in God's new creation, He will not move any part of man's body independent of man's own will
Even if man is willing, He will not substitute for man and move any part of his body because man has a free will
When he receives revelation in spirit, he should use his mind, emotion, and will to carry out the order of the Spirit
Forsaking one's soul and body and expecting the Holy Spirit to directly use them is the initial step to demon-possession
A believer may think this means that God will speak on behalf of him that he need not speak and that God will speak words out from his mouth
He assumes it means that he does not need to use his memory anymore and that God will make him remember everything
Evil spirits are allowed to give him a substitute for love because he is so passive and does not use his will to control his loving function
Because a believer misunderstands the meaning of humility, he thinks that he should hide himself in everything
When a believer is very possessed and self-abased, his surroundings seem to become all darkness, despair, and weakness
When great needs arise in God's kingdom, his extreme self-abasement will not allow him to lift so much as a finger
The apostles knew that we are in danger of being biased, so they immediately said that we have to withstand the devil after we submit
If we are misled to think that there is only God's will in this world, we will be deceived by the devil and take his will as God's will
Consequently, there is no need for his will to have any further selection, consideration, determination, resistance, or anything else
Our attitude should be the same all the time, but our practice should be carried out only after we understand the circumstance
Rather, it means that we have the intention to submit to God, but we want to know if it is God that we are submitting to
The balanced truth is to be submissive in attitude yet, at the same time, to accept something only after one is clear about its source
In this way, they make believers suffer the sin of others, while considering this to be an example of not resisting 'him who is evil'
Because the believer is totally consecrated, he thinks that he should take the way of the cross and suffer for the sake of Christ
He wants to receive power from God, so he willingly becomes weak, hoping that by so doing, he will become strong
After his consecration, he may passively submit to every suffering that befalls him, no matter through what means the suffering comes
If he passively accepts all the sufferings, evil spirits will have a good opportunity to make him suffer their sufferings
He may think that he is suffering for the sake of the church, to fill up that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ
If the believer investigates a little, he may discover that before his consecration, he did not have this kind of experience
After a believer knows the truth about demon-possession, he will be able to remove sins and also remove the meaningless afflictions
If a believer does not resist, oppose, and refuse such weakness in a definite way, he will remain weak for a long time
Whoever is passive in the will or fulfills the condition for the work of evil spirits will find demons working in him
Even though many believers have not consciously chosen these things, they unconsciously fall into passivity and give ground to evil spirits
Let all who have the experiences mentioned above ask themselves whether they have been fulfilling the condition for evil spirits to work
If the degree of passivity is high, it will give place to the manifestation of many supernatural wonders through the body
We should not be surprised by the supernatural experiences of many believers, such as tongue-speaking, seeing visions, hearing voices, etc
If there is a certain phenomenon and behavior, there must be a consequence that results from the phenomenon and behavior
If a person intentionally or unintentionally transgresses this law, he will experience a predicted consequence
Whether you are a Christian or one who practices sorcery, as long as you are passive, evil spirits will attach themselves to you
A passive believer falls into his condition because of deception, and the reasons for deception are foolishness and ignorance
A believer must know the truth concerning the source and nature of all of his experiences before he has the hope of deliverance
The believer is deceived, then he becomes passive, then he becomes possessed, then he is deceived into further passivity
Since the beginning of this book, we have repeatedly warned the believers about the danger of all supernatural experiences
If a believer has not died to his emotional life and earnestly seeks after experiences in his feeling, he will be deceived
A believer should never forget that if the Holy Spirit gives him a supernatural experience, he can still use his own mind
If a believer wants to know where his own experience comes from, he should do some checking and find out if he is passive or not
He may think that he is making twice as much progress as others, that he is already spiritual, and that he will not make mistakes
It is very difficult to make him admit that he may be possessed by the demons or prove to him that he is in fact possessed by the demons!
It takes humility and honesty to be willing to know the truth concerning our own spiritual and supernatural experiences
Some obtain the truth when other believers preach the truth to them and enlighten them concerning the real fact
When a believer receives a little light from the truth, he will admit that it is very possible that he can be deceived
While we can say with certainty that a believer can give ground to evil spirits, we need to ask what the ground is
Otherwise he will consider demonpossession to be something that it is not or something that is not demonpossession to be demonpossession
Perhaps he will confuse his daily spiritual warfare with the dark authority with warfare for the freedom from demon-possession
Being passive is allowing one's own mind or body to fall into a state of complete inactivity stopping the use of all one's faculties
No matter to what degree of passivity the believer has fallen, he should remove this ground as long as there is passivity
A common thought concerning the matter of demon- possession is that one only needs to cast the demons out by the name of the Lord
If the cause of possession is deception, and we only order the demons to depart, we are only dealing with the effect and not the cause
While it is important to cast out the demons, it is indispensable that one deals with the matter of the ground
Unless one specifically and continuously reclaims the deceived and passive ground, there will not be lasting freedom
If a believer does not deal with the ground he gives to evil spirits, it will cause evil spirits to come in and stay
They may change to another kind of manifestation, or they may stop the present manifestation for a while to avoid further attack
The mind must receive the truth, and the will must vigorously, actively, and resolutely repudiate all the ground
When a believer finds out that he has given ground to evil spirits in a particular matter, he should immediately reclaim the ground
The believer must obey God's will, oppose Satan's will, and exercise his own will and join himself to the will of the saints
If this decision is genuine, a person will not turn back no matter how much he is opposed by evil spirits in the process of his reclamation
On the one hand, the believer should oppose the work of evil spirits in him, and on the other hand, he should reject evil spirits
When they see the believer's attitude of opposition, they still occupy their original ground and will not retreat
When a believer is engaged in such a resisting work, he must exert his strength and exercise his will to drive out the evil spirits
It is of little use to resist without also rejecting, because promises given to evil spirits at the beginning must be reclaimed
In the midst of such decision, rejection, choosing, and withstanding, the believer is fighting for his sovereignty
When a believer begins to reclaim his ground, he is opposing the evil spirits in their work of 'replacing' him
When he exercises his own will to utter his own decision, choice, and rejection, evil spirits will not be able to go on with their works
For a believer to become passive in his will is like going downhill; everything progresses downward until he falls to the lowest point
He should know his normal condition; he should know how active his will was, how clear his mind was, and how strong his body was
He has to set his normal condition before him all the time, yet still consider this normal condition as the least of his goals
Only then will he not be deceived to think that he is free when he is in fact not recovered to his normal condition
The moment we fall into passivity, evil spirits will take hold of our passive faculties and use them in our stead or with our help
When a possessed believer tries to overturn the authority of evil spirits, evil spirits will try to stop their prisoner from acting freely
The will has lost its sovereignty and no longer can freely control and direct every faculty of the entire being
As a result, evil spirits come in to substitute for the will and to control and direct every faculty of the entire being
His present rejection is needed to cancel out his previous consent so that the evil spirits will lose their ground of attack
The will of the believer still needs to pass through very fierce warfare before it can become strong, powerful, and free
The mind needs to think clearly; it needs to be able to think about the subjects that the will wants to think about
The memory needs to be able to memorize the things that a person wants to remember and not be filled with thoughts that he does not want
A believer should not only refuse the ground taken by evil spirits, he also should refuse all the work done by evil spirits
The believer needs to ask God to give him light so that he will know the works of the evil spirits and refuse them one by one
The works of evil spirits on the believer include: replacing the believer's activities and influencing the believer's activities
The believer ought to reject their work by not allowing his activities to be replaced or his activities to be influenced
Unless he engages them in combat with all his might, he cannot return to his normal condition and regain his freedom
It seems that the more he fights, the less power he has, and the areas that are possessed by the enemy are more confused and disorderly
Every believer can be delivered out of the authority of darkness and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of His love in his experience
If the ground is rejected and reclaimed in a detailed way, the degree of demon-possession will also be reduced bit by bit
Although it may take some time before a believer can be completely free, nevertheless, he is on the way to freedom
The believer should not be misled to think that his spiritual life is going backward because he feels these things once again
When a believer reaches this step, he should advance faithfully, because he will soon experience a full release
When we look at the pattern of the Lord Jesus, we can see that a person who is one with God still has the capability of his will
The verses do not say that He does not have His will; rather, they say that He did not seek, perform, or accomplish His own will
Whoever is really one with God should not eliminate the function of the will; rather, he should put his will on the side of God's will
God does not want the believer to follow Him blindly; He wants the believer to use his whole being sensibly to do His will
God wants believers to vigorously prepare their members and actively obey after they have spent the time to examine and understand Gods will
Through the salvation accomplished by the Lord Jesus on the cross, believers today can freely choose and follow God's will
Though he does not know what belongs to God, he can choose God in his 'motive' and choose everything that is of God
When a believer is really spiritual and when he bears the fruit of the Spirit, not only can kindness, joy, meekness, etc
The experienced believer knows that when his spirit becomes agitated, he has to exercise his will to control it
When we say that the spirit controls our whole being, we mean that the intuition of the spirit expresses God's will
When we say that our will controls our whole being, we mean that our will is directly controlling our whole being according to God's will
When the believer's will reaches the state of total self-control, he will not be frustrated by any part of his being
On the one hand, we should be one with God; on the other hand, we should buffet our whole being so that it will obey us fully
By understanding these few verses, we will not be mistaken concerning the position of the believers' body in the plan of God's redemption
Verse 10 says, 'But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness'
The life in the spirit is truly life, and the life in the body is nothing but death, because our body is still a 'body of sin'
Although sin has been cast out from the spirit and the will, the redemption of the body is still something in the future
He dispensed Christ's righteousness into us at the same time that He entered into us to be our life and revive our dead spirit
He was unwilling for even one believer not to know and draw upon this in faith, thereby losing this portion of blessing
God is only making a comparison between the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and our bodies that have now received life
These are impossible in our present life; these things will happen only when the Lord takes us up and our bodies are redeemed
How many believers really have the experience of the Spirit of the Lord giving life to their mortal body every day?
They simply hope that God, through the Holy Spirit, will give them strength so that they can live for themselves
Based on these two conditions, the apostle continued, 'So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh'
Based on these provisions of the Holy Spirit, our inner life can now give orders directly to the outer body without any hindrance
Of course, the Bible does not forbid us to have some care for the body; when illness occurs, it will require more attention
We must and should not allow these things to enter deeply into our hearts or become part of the goals of our daily living
These things should come according to needs and go according to needs; they should never linger inside us for a long time
Because of the work of God or because more important needs exist we should be able to buffet ourselves and not be under the bodys subjection
We should not sin through the lust of the flesh, and we should not reduce the spiritual work because of the weakness of the flesh
Since God has made such provisions, the believers will suffer punishment if they do not receive them and live according to the flesh instead
If we neglect to put to death the practices of the body by the Holy Spirit, we cannot expect the Holy Spirit to give life to our body
If we have not consecrated ourselves fully, we would only live for ourselves more if the Holy Spirit gave us health, strength, and power!
Only the Holy Spirit can 'apply' what the cross has accomplished, and only He can cause it to become our experience
It is good to know 'that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled'
It is not surprising that they think this way, because they have forgotten the Holy Spirit who alone can turn the cross into experience
He said that everything is lawful because, according to nature, all the desires of the body, such as eating, drinking, sex, etc
Verse 13 says, 'Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them
The matter of eating and drinking provides believers with an opportunity to carry out the instruction, 'The body is
Eating and drinking should not hinder our fellowship with God; they should only preserve our body in its normal condition
They forget that all of their nerves, sensations, activities, living, working, eating, drinking, speaking, etc
They consider the body worthless in the realm of spiritual life and that there is no provision of grace for it in God's salvation
Although they know that the Lord healed the body more than He saved souls in the four Gospels, they interpret these acts spiritually
A physiological makeup that is overly-sensitive and provocative easily leads to frigidity, severity, and harshness of speech
The reason many people have a peculiar disposition is that they are peculiar in their physiological constitution
No matter what kind of physiological constitution we have whether it is weaker than others or not we can rely on the Lord to overcome it
In our daily living, He wants us to experience His resurrection power and see that our body also lives by Him on this earth
If we really want to experience that the Lord is for the body, we must first practice having the body for the Lord
If we take the members of Christ and join them to a prostitute, making them also members of a prostitute, where will Christ stand then?
The apostle believes that one who is joined to the Lord is initially 'one spirit' with the Lord because this is the union of spirits
He admits that the initial joining is in the spirit, but the union of the spirit also makes the believer's body become a member of Christ
Christians are often misled to think that since the body is a member of Christ, everything should be evidenced by the body
They think that God's presence should be felt in the body, that God shakes the body, and that the shaking of God is in the body
If a believer exalts the position of his body beyond what it should be, evil spirits will take the opportunity to work
We should not be surprised that the apostle emphatically reminded and repeatedly exhorted the believers to flee fornication
We can look at it another way: if fornication is so deplorable, the union of our body with Christ must be very real
Verse 19 says, 'Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God'
Because His body has passed through death, resurrection, and glorification, He can supply the Holy Spirit to our body
How wonderful it would be if we saw that the Lord through His Spirit dwelling in us heals us strengthens us and becomes our health and life!
If we believe that our own body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, we will follow the Spirit in awe and joy with much holiness and love
On the one hand we will be freed from selfishness selflove and sin and on the other hand we will be freed from weakness sickness and pain
Since sickness is so common, we will inevitably have a great lack in our lives if we do not know how to deal with it
When the Lord Jesus came to save, not only did He forgive man's transgressions, but He also healed man's sicknesses
Many passages in the New Testament that speak of the Lord Jesus' redemption as being a fulfillment of prophecy make reference to Isaiah 53
We should realize that if the Lord Jesus only forgives our sins without healing our sicknesses, His salvation is still not complete
If we study the Gospels, we will see that the Lord Jesus seems to have done more healing work than anything else
In those days, men believed that the Lord Jesus had the power to heal sickness, but they doubted His grace to forgive sins
Believers seem to think that the Lord Jesus only comes to save people from sin, but they have forgotten that He is also the healing Savior
After He said to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' He also said, 'Rise, take up your bed and go to your house'
Sickness is merely a condition in our human lives and does not seem to have any relationship whatsoever with God
Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit the apostle wrote concerning His healing Healing all those who were being oppressed by the devil
We often think that sickness is only a problem of the body and that it has nothing to do with God's righteousness, holiness, and judgment
The apostle tells us most vividly that sickness is the result of our sin and that it is a chastisement from God
Because of the story of the blind man in John 9, many believers do not consider that sickness is a chastisement from God because of sin
Sickness is usually God's disciplining so that we would pay attention to the sin that we have neglected and repudiate it
Perhaps we have harbored a presumptuous and covetous heart in the work, or have become disobedient after God has spoken
Every time a believer is disciplined by God and becomes sick, there is the potential of receiving great blessings
He should put himself fully in the light of God and sincerely examine and find the shortage in himself that has led to God's discipline
If this sin has caused a loss to others, he should do his best to compensate and believe that God is pleased with this
The great work of the Lord Jesus' redemption includes both the forgiveness of sins as well as the healing of sicknesses
He is so willing to heal us and bring us into a more intimate fellowship with Himself through our further perception of His love and power
At other times, we can say that we are totally willing to obey God and that we are satisfied no matter how God treats us
He occasionally allows sicknesses to come upon His beloved children in order to see their attitude toward His ordained will
God has to prolong the period of sickness on his body because He will not remove His means until His goal is accomplished
Regardless of how precarious the conditions of the body and environment are, they are all measured by His hands
If a believer resists the things that come upon him, he inevitably resists the God who permits such things to come upon him
If he becomes bitter through the suffering of his illness, he will inevitably resist the God who permits such illness to come upon him
If the Lord wants you to be sick this way and continue to be sick in the future, are you willing to take it or not?
Can you obey until He has accomplished all that He wants to accomplish and only then ask for healing according to His will?
He knows that it is very easy for our heart to be turned away from Him and His will and turned toward His gifts
He allows sickness and other similar things to come upon us so that we will see whether we are for God or for His gift
If, in every adverse circumstance, we do not seek after anything by ourselves or for ourselves, we are indeed seeking for God
In God's work, in our dealing with people and matters, in our thinking and opinions, there are too many indomitable wills
God allows us to pass through profound grief and pain in order to break us and cause us to give up the self-will that He deplores
It is unfortunate that even when he reaches such a point, he still does not know how to turn around and grasp the promise of God's healing
When he has a little temperature, catches a little cold, or loses a night of sleep, he becomes very uncomfortable
He spends a great amount of time thinking about his own body and its condition, and not the Lord and what He wants to accomplish in him
In the midst of a sickness, He wants us to learn not to look at our symptoms and care for our pain, but to look at Him wholeheartedly
Every time a bad symptom is discovered, it should always warn us not to think of the body anymore, but to wholly think of the Lord
Although many times we see this kind of believer momentarily healed, the healing does not last; after a while, the old sickness recurs
Many people debate whether or not one should use medicine as if once this question is settled, all questions will be settled
A person knows that aside from depending on the salvation of the Lord Jesus, there is no way to gain access to heaven's door
Does it not have numerous philosophies psychologies ethics morals regulations and education to advance men upward and deliver men from sin
Are we after the salvation accomplished by the Lord Jesus on the cross, or are we after these worldly methods?
Consequently, the sickness which was meant to turn him to a closer relationship with God turns him away from God
Consequently, when he is eventually healed, he will not only derive benefit for his body but also receive blessing in his spirit
We only want to ask: is not the Lord Jesus explicitly given by God to the believers as the Savior of their sicknesses?
If the whole goal of our struggle with Satan in sickness is to obtain a cure, any kind of healing is sufficient
These kinds of believers do not stand on the position of redemption; they simply stand on the same position as the worldly people
Concerning the matter of sickness, they are the same as the worldly people and cannot give any testimony for God
The lesson for us is that God's goal in all illness is to have us cease from our own activities and depend on Him utterly
Because we love ourselves, we single-mindedly seek after healing and forget about God and the lesson He wants to teach us
In the former case, the believer anxiously seeks a cure; in the latter case, the believer quietly seeks God's will
After a believer stops using earthly ways or medicine and trusts in God wholeheartedly, his own faith will become much stronger than before
If we fix our gaze on the promise, we will draw near to God, our faith will be enhanced, and we will receive the healing
It is interesting to note that the apostle would encourage him to use something like wine, which is on the borderline between good and evil
If our body has some weakness we need to take in according to the Lords leading the things that are nourishing and beneficial to our body
If we follow the Lord's guidance and take in things that are nutritious to the body, they will increase our body's strength
As a result of going along with God's will through His chastisement, they have become very gentle, kind, yielding, and holy
Accordingly, they consider that being sick is a great benefit for them, and they begin to love sickness more than health
Perhaps if he were healthy and could choose freely, he would want to turn back to the world and his natural self
It is true that sickness can glorify God because sickness provides God an opportunity to manifest His healing power
The Lord Jesus never considered sickness as a blessing, as something which believers should bear until they die
The Lord Jesus desired His disciples to bear the cross, but He never said that the sick should remain in sickness all the time
He told the disciples the manner in which they should suffer for Him, but He never said that they should suffer sickness for His sake
He may temporarily discipline us and cause us to lose our health, but He is not pleased to see us constantly in weakness
We can especially see the heart of the heavenly Father and His attitude toward sickness in the story of the healing of the leper
If a believer thinks that God is not willing to heal him and that he should remain in sickness forever, he does not know God's will
Although sometimes His permissive will allows them to become sick it is for their profit His ordained will is always for them to be healthy
If we read the book of Job, we will see that it was the devil who caused Job to become sick , and it was God who healed Job
The thorn that caused the apostle Paul to be weakened was 'a messenger of Satan' , but the One who made him strong was God
God may want very much to heal them, but because they do not have the faith to ask, they never receive this gift
They would rather have others believe for them or have God give them faith and make them believe apart from their own effort
Unless their will is motivated, and unless they resist the devil and hold onto the Lord Jesus, the God-given faith will not come
Many patients do not have to be sick; they are sick because they do not have the strength to claim God's promises
We must realize that the spiritual blessings that we receive in sickness are far less than the spiritual blessings we gain in restoration
If, through trusting in God and consecrating ourselves to Him, we are healed, we should continue to live a holy life after our restoration
If there are elders of the church who can anoint with oil , we should invite them to come and let them follow the injunction of the Bible
The indwelling of the Holy Spirit not only strengthens our inner man and enlightens the eyes of our heart, it also makes our body healthy
On the one hand, there is the breaking down, and on the other hand, there is the replenishment by food and rest
Our contact with the spiritual realm and all of our spiritual life, work, and warfare are beyond what our physical body can bear
Our contact with sins, sinners, and evil spirits dries up our body's resources so that we become unable to meet many needs
We should realize that if we rely on material food, nutrition, and medicine, we are looking to the wrong source
For this reason, we need to see that though these things transpire in the physical body, they are spiritual matters
Receiving Gods healing and strengthening is not a physical experience but a spiritual experience even though it occurs in the physical body
God wants us to learn how to allow the resurrected, glorious, and ever-overcoming life of Christ to be manifested in every part of our being
Rather, we should depend on the life of God's Son which gives life to our members in a way that the soul-life cannot
All of our spiritual experiences come from this wonderful thing called 'life' which richly enters into our being
According to the natural way, man must live by bread; but when the word of God proceeds with its power, man can live by it as well
When bread cannot produce the effect that we expect, His word can give us the life that the bread fails to provide
Today our failure to realize that there is a rich provision in God's Word for our physical body is a great loss
If we live on this earth for even one more day, the strength that the Lord promises to our body will extend for one more day
God does not have the intention of giving us another day in our life without giving us the strength for that day
God wants His children's strength to be the same as their days; therefore, He promises that He will be their strength
It was very common for the saints of old to know God as their strength or to experience His strength being given to their physical body
When we read Judges and see the strength of Samson, it becomes clear to us that the Holy Spirit can bestow great strength upon man's body
By looking at some of Davids songs in the Psalms we can find that he received Gods strength in his body I love You O Jehovah my strength
In the Old Testament grace was not manifested as much as it is today yet the Old Testament saints experienced God as their physical strength
One thing that we stress very much is that God's life not only heals our sicknesses but also keeps us healthy, apart from sickness
Rather, He becomes life to our physical body so that our body may also live by Him and receive all the strength needed for His work
May we know that God's healing is not just to heal us but also to keep sicknesses away and to preserve our strength and health
He told us that he had a thorn in his flesh and that he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him
His life does not change the weak and mortal nature of our body; rather, it saturates the body with what it cannot provide
According to his natural condition, Paul was the weakest, but according to the power he received from Christ, he was the strongest
He said, 'Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body
For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh
What attracts our attention the most is that even though verses 10 and 11 are seemingly repetitive, they actually are not
Many people can express the life of Jesus in their body but do not take a step further to do so in their mortal flesh
They do not know that the Lord Jesus can heal their sickness, nor have they heard that His life is also for their humble body
In the past we depended on our natural life as the source of our strength, but now we depend on the life of Christ for our supply
We may lose the manifestation of the life of the Lord Jesus in our body by way of carelessness, independence, or sin
At other times we may suffer constantly for the sake of the Body of Christ because of our deep experience with it
One thing is certain: although we may be weak, God's will is that we would never be handicapped, fail in His work, or cause Him to suffer
We see that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh is based upon always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake
He does not give His life to our body so that we may waste His strength; nor does He supply strength for the accomplishment of our purpose
We see the reason that many seek healing and strength but never get them they think that health and strength are something for them to enjoy
They seek God's life for their body in order that they may be more comfortable, happy, free, and less bound when taking any action
God is now waiting for those who are willing to accept the death of the Lord Jesus so that He may live in their body
We should not blame our forefathers for their mistakes and sins; neither should we doubt God's love and wisdom
He does not exchange our weak constitution for a strong one, nor does He simply impart a great amount of strength to us
We do not feel safe at all in our natural strength; instead, we commit ourselves to the Lord's life for every breath
If we were able to live independently of the life-giving Lord, would we not be led to follow ourselves and lose our heart of dependence?
Some believers may think that they do not need to pursue this kind of experience until they begin to be weak because their bodies are strong
He dares not overwork, carelessly eat, or freely expose himself to danger as those who are naturally weak dare not do
As a result people may admire them for a short time, but the strength of their body will not sustain them for long
If we work apart from Him, we will see God's life leak away and find ourselves once again bearing the work with our own poor body
If we are obedient we will see that His life is indeed for us; if not, He will never give us His strength in order for us to disobey Him
Although the enemy still tempts us to think that this is very risky and self-abasing, we are no longer as fearful as before
They do not ask for more than what God supplies; neither are they satisfied with less than what God has promised
We are fallen already if we only covet God's protection and supply, or if we only call upon Him to escape from our trials
He should always remember that he is gradually falling away if his goal is merely to seek God's gift rather than to care for God Himself
By the blood of the lamb, the Israelites were delivered from the hand of the angel who smote the firstborn of Egypt
Enoch and Elijah were both raptured into heaven without tasting death even more excellent examples of overcoming death
To overcome sin, the self, the world, and Satan is very crucial; but our victory still is not complete if we fail to overcome death
Although the power of death has not reached its climax, it is already reigning and expanding its territory in the entire body
Since we have been baptized into His death, however, we are not only dead unto sin; we are also able to receive life and live unto God
We are joined unto Christ; therefore, as 'death lords it over Him no more' , so neither can it bind us anymore
One thing is certain: most of today's believers have not experienced the overcoming of death to the degree that God has purposed
Similarly, since Christ has condemned sin in the flesh, believers no longer must sin, although they still may sin
He has overcome these completely in Christ; therefore, God is now calling him to overcome them in his experience
God desires that we take the matter of overcoming death as a reality that is by the death of Christ we overcome the death in us practically
We have overcome many temptations, the flesh, the world, and Satan; now we should rise up to defeat the power of death
Since we must resist death in the same way that we resist sin, our attitude toward death should be totally changed
If they should not die, He will definitely rescue them from it; if they should die, nothing can stop God from letting them
Since the Lord Jesus has met and overcome death for us, He wants every one of us to overcome it in our present life
We should not ask God to grant us strength to bear the power of death; we should ask instead for the strength to overcome its authority
Because death comes from sin, our deliverance from death is based upon the fact that the Lord Jesus has died for us and saved us from sin
The Lord Jesus Himself entered into the realm of death and through His redemption abolished its sting sin so that Satan has lost his power
He also should believe that the Lord will carry through his resistance because He still has work for him to do
If we have not finished the work assigned to us, we can be calm and still believe even though our body may be beset with danger
As long as we work and fight together with the Lord, He will definitely work to swallow up our death with His life
At another time 'Jesus walked in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him'
He was not afraid of death; because the work was not finished, he trusted in God, knowing that he would not die
Knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me'
The Bible gives us a general number The days of our years are threescore years and ten and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years
We do not mean that everyone must live to be at least seventy years old; God's sovereignty cannot be infringed upon by man
Since the Bible takes seventy as a general standard for human life, we can hope to live until that time if we have faith
Whether we live briefly or for a long time, we should not perish like sinners before half of our days are over
When the end does come we can depart from the earth in peace by the grace of God in a way that is as natural as the falling of a ripe melon
According to the prophecy in the Bible, there will eventually be a group of believers who will be raptured without passing through death
He also says, 'This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread shall live forever'
He means that among His believers some will die and be resurrected, while others will not pass through death at all
We only know that after we die He will resurrect us, but we forget that while we are living He wants to be our life to save us from dying
He also said that there will be a group of people who 'lives and believes into Me,' who will 'by no means die forever'
Since the second coming of the Lord Jesus is already near, why should we have to die before then and wait for resurrection?
Why not look to Him to rapture us at His second coming so that we may be totally delivered from the power of death?
On the cross the Lord Jesus fully overcame death, but God desires that the church would experience His victory
If they recognized these deadening attacks and withstood them just as they withstand death, they would overcome
If we had identified these as the attacks of death, God would have supplied us with the power to overcome them experientially
Grasp the promise that God has given you, pray to be delivered from death, and believe that nothing can hurt you
If we theoretically consent to the fact that we can be completely freed from death, but yield passively to its power, what profit is this?
Because of their neglect, some of God's children have had their days on the earth shortened and their crowns lost
The Bible does not tell us explicitly what kind of sin the sin unto death is, but it is certain that such a sin does exist
According to the record in the Bible concerning the believers' experiences, we know that this sin varies among people
The man of God who journeyed from Judah to Bethel committed a sin unto death simply because he disobeyed God's commandment concerning eating
The Word says that many Corinthian believers slept because they were 'guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord'
Although the Bible does not tell us to pray for others who commit this type of sin, God will forgive us if we examine ourselves and repent
In this life it is impossible to reach sinless perfection, but frequent confession and dependence upon God's grace are indispensable
My son, forget not my law;/but let thine heart keep my commandments:/for length of days, and long life,/and peace, shall they add to thee'
After receiving enlightenment, the life of our physical body will definitely be lengthened if we truly fulfill God's conditions
Although our body is not yet redeemed, we can taste by faith the powers of the coming age in having no weakness, sickness, or death
Faith transcends time; it can appropriate both what God has accomplished for us in the past and what He will accomplish for us in the future
Although we have not experienced this completely, we can experience part of it because we have the down payment of the Holy Spirit
What everyone will experience in the millennium, the members of Christ should first experience on the earth today
We should live for Him moment by moment and apply His resurrection life for the needs of our spirit, soul, and body
May we believe that victory over death is a reality, that the rapture is definite, and that the time will not be long
Keep your spirit from all earthly defilements We are not waiting to die here But are looking moment by moment to be raptured from this world
