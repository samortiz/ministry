   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Replacing the New Ones but Leading Them</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Bear the Responsibilities of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not replace the new ones, but lead them to bear the responsibilities of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lead the new ones to do everything in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During the initial stage of the first three or four weeks of meeting with the new ones, it might be awkward because many of them have never been in a Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They do not know how to pray, how to speak the word of God, or how to sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, you have to teach and instruct them like a mother teaching her children to speak or to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to consider all the new ones as little babes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the past we did not help the new ones that much because we did everything for them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We merely charged them to come to the meetings, and we let them observe the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That way was not so profitable or life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, that way somewhat annulled and deadened people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To some extent it also kept people away from the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have found the secret to having remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To have remaining fruit, we must bring the meeting to the new ones homes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not ask them to come to a meeting, but we should bring a meeting to their homes and help them to carry out a meeting in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to impress them that the meeting is not our meeting but their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ALWAYS FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>IN THE INITIAL STAGE ABOUT HOW TO MEET</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should always fellowship with the new ones in the initial stage about how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not need to have a formal program for the home meetings and small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the initial stage of meeting with the new believers for the first one or two months, you may stop in the middle of the meeting to have a little talk.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because there are only three to five people in a home meeting, it is easy to stop the meeting and talk a little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the meeting can resume.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In one meeting, we may have to stop three or four times in the initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, we will make ourselves the pastors, and the new ones in our home meetings will be our audience like a congregation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The meeting should always be carried on in a conversational way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not make it so formal or legal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sometimes you may stop the meeting for three minutes to fellowship in order to guide them, lead them, and bring them into the real practice of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From the very beginning of their Christian life, we must give them the impression that the Christian meetings are gatherings in which every attendant participates.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the first three terms of the full-time training in Taipei, we did not instruct the trainees to bring the newly baptized ones to the regular church meetings because at that time, the church meetings were still somewhat in the old way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once the new ones are brought to a meeting with a large congregation and a good speaker, they will be damaged and it will be hard to change their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Good mothers know that it is wise to keep their children away from wrong things and sinful things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once a child sees some wrong, bad, sinful things, it is really hard to wash away the impression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, it is profitable to keep the newly baptized ones meeting in their homes according to the scriptural way so that they acquire a taste for this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the children who are raised in Japan have the Japanese taste.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they come to live in the United States, it is hard for them to get rid of their taste.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, if the new ones are brought up in the new way, they will not have a taste for any other way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>RENDERING SOME SHORT TEACHINGS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>OF THE CRUCIAL THINGS TO THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>IN THE FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM SPONTANEOUSLY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you teach the new ones, do not give them the sensation that you are now going to teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, render some short teachings of the crucial things to the new ones spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As you are talking to them, you can insert some teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spontaneously you may open the Bible to 1 Corinthians 14:26 and ask them to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then you can say that this verse tells us that when we Christians come together, each one has something.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may ask the three-year-old girl of the family, Do you have something?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She may say, Yes, I have a little song.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you can say, Sing it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do not take care of your teaching at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Always give them the opportunity to function.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why the home meeting should not have a prearranged program.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to take every opportunity to train the new ones to function.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When some of the saints have gone to visit the home meetings, they have gone with a prearranged program.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When they entered the home, the little girl may have been singing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then they told the little girl to stop and sit down so that they could carry out their prearranged program.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not only very poor but also a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not stop her singing, but utilize her singing to start the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you take care of this principle, you will learn a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After the little girl finishes her singing, the mother may ask you what the Passover is in the book of Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not tell her that this is too deep for her and that we had better not touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This kills the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even if they ask about the New Jerusalem, you should not tell them that it is too deep for them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Talk with them about the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The seeking new ones can pick up any new term.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It may be hard for us because we are too old, too conservative, and too filled up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may not be poor in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead we may be overloaded with old concepts and past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some of the brothers may not understand a certain revelation from the Word even after it is shared a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But it is easy for the new ones who are seeking and simple to receive any new thought from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is amazing how little children are able to learn a language without formal instruction and without a dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Within a short time they know what the words mommy and daddy mean and are able to say them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the home meetings, the new ones will follow whatever we say.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They do not question and critically discern everything that is said.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many of us, however, have become accustomed to the doctrines in the Scriptures and are too full in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord Jesus said, Blessed are the poor in spirit Matt 5:3 because the scribes and Pharisees were filled with the traditions and practices of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There was no emptiness, space, or capacity in them for the Lord s new teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This does not mean that we should have a poor spirit but that we should be poor in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to be emptied and unloaded in our spirit to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
