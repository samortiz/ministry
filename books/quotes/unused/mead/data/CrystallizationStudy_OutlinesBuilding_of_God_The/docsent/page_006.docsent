   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The gifted persons, especially the apostles and the prophets, perfect the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12: Christ does not build the church by Himself directly but through His gifted members v. 11.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gifted persons have only one ministry to minister Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ; this is the unique ministry in the New Testament economy 2 Cor 4:1; 1 Tim 1:12.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever the gifted persons do as the work of the ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:16.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The growth of the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ in the church, which results in the building up of the Body by the Body itself 3:17a: When Christ enters into the saints and lives within them, the Christ within the saints becomes the church Col 3:10-11.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Body of Christ grows by the growth of Christ within us and is built up this way 1:18; 2:19.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The love in which the Body builds itself up is not our own love but the love of God in Christ, which becomes the love of Christ in us, by which we love Christ and the fellow members of His Body 1 John 4:7-8, 11, 16, 19; Rom 5:5; 8:39: Love is the inner substance of God; when we enter into God s inner substance, we enjoy God as love and enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine love, and thereby love others as Christ did Eph 5:25.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is in such a love that we hold to truth, that is, to Christ with His Body, and are kept from being influenced by the winds of teaching and from bringing in elements that are foreign to the Body 4:14-15.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ makes His home in our hearts through the operation of the Triune God; the Father is the source, the Spirit is the means, the Son is the object and goal, and the fullness of the Triune God is the issue Eph 3:14, 16-17a, 19.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Christ makes His home in our hearts, we are filled with the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God for the corporate expression of the Triune God vv.</S>
