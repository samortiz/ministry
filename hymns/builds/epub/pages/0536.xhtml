<div class='line'><b>1</b> Objective and subjective Christ is to us,</div>
<div class='line'>In heaven He's pleading objectively thus;</div>
<div class='line'>Subjectively now in His members He lives</div>
<div class='line'>And inwardly to them His being He gives.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> In heaven He sits at the right hand of God,</div>
<div class='line'>Where as the High Priest He presented His blood;</div>
<div class='line'>Our Advocate, bearing our burdens above,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Surety, He careth for us in His love.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> He now is the Spirit, our spirit within;</div>
<div class='line'>He's there as our life, all things bringing with Him;</div>
<div class='line'>He's there as our strength and our grace every hour,</div>
<div class='line'>Our Paraclete in us, sustaining with pow'r.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> In heaven for us He's the glorified man,</div>
<div class='line'>The Forerunner entered, fulfilling God's plan;</div>
<div class='line'>Man into God bringing and making him one</div>
<div class='line'>With God in the heav'nlies, in Him as the Son.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> In us all the fulness of God dwells in Him;</div>
<div class='line'>As Spirit He brings God Himself thus within,</div>
<div class='line'>Revealing and making God real unto us,</div>
<div class='line'>God one with us building in life glorious.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>6</b> The Savior ascended in heaven now dwells,</div>
<div class='line'>And soon He's returning for us His Word tells;</div>
<div class='line'>Deliverer indwelling, He now in us lives,</div>
<div class='line'>And soon will transfigure, His glory to give.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>7</b> The day soon is coming when heaven and earth</div>
<div class='line'>Will mingle in one in that city of worth;</div>
<div class='line'>Objective and subjective will in that day</div>
<div class='line'>Be mingled within us in glory for aye.</div>
