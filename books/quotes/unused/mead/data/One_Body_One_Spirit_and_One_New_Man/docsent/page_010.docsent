   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE THREE THE PRACTICAL EXPRESSION OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; 4:10, 13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these days I have been very happy because for many years I have been waiting for an opportunity to release some messages specifically concerning the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now I feel that I have such a good opportunity for us to focus on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we do not know the Body well enough, we will never be able to thoroughly know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Until now, very few Christians have known what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is important that we all have a clear knowledge of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>LIVING BY CHRIST BEING THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I must first paint a background.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The worst kind of concept Christians have concerning the church is that the church is a chapel, to consider that a building, a chapel, is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all know that this is a great mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of knowledge is not even worth mentioning, and we can throw it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Brethren rose up in the last century to strongly teach that a chapel, as a building for worship, is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They told people that the church is not a place but a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They found the light in the New Testament to prove that the church is a gathering together of the redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Greek the word for church means the gathering together of the called-out ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the surface it is right to say that the church is not a place or a hall but a gathering together of the ones called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yes, such a gathering is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is, however, a problem here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can describe it by means of an example.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may be a group of about one hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of us have been called, and we have the opportunity to gather together at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, according to the letter, all of us gathered together are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, suppose that none of us lives in the spirit, that all one hundred of us are living in one hundred different minds.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some are from Singapore with a Singaporean mind; some are from Tokyo with a Japanese mind; some are from Seoul with a Korean mind; and some are from Germany with a German mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>None of us knows what it means to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all have our own opinions, our own views, and our own backgrounds; the only thing we have in common is that we have all believed in the Lord Jesus and have become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With regard to our sins having been washed away by the precious blood, we all are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With regard to the Lord Jesus being our Savior, we also are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning our belief of the Bible, we all are carrying the same Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all say that we are those who belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apparently we are the church when we gather together, but what about the reality of this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Three Christians may be totally French, another three are completely German, and another eight are wholly Singaporean.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all feel that our sins have been washed away, and we have been saved; we also feel that the Lord loves us, and we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, none of us lives in the spirit or by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, we are the church, but on the other hand, we cannot say that we are truly the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are not the church because we are all in our minds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we have Christ, our Christ is on the throne in the heavens and in our minds, but He is not in our spirit or in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not live by Christ, and we cannot say, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moreover, when we come together we cannot say that here there is no French, no German, no Singaporean, no Filipino but all are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can see that apparently we are the church, but in reality we are not at all the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is true that we are the assembly of the called-out ones, and based on this we acknowledge that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In reality, however, we are not the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This word is hard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How can we say that we are the church but not the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I tell you that according to reality this is the case.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Apparently, we are all Christians, and we are the church when we come together; however, from the viewpoint of the Body, we are not the Body of Christ, nor are we the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some of us are the fullness of France, some of us are the fullness of Germany, and some of us are the fullness of Singapore; but we are not the fullness of Christ.</S>
