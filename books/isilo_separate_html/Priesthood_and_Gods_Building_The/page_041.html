<p>The most important item worn by the priests was the breastplate with twelve precious stones set in gold (vv. 17-21). These precious stones denote God&rsquo;s people. The significance of the breastplate points to the importance of the priesthood in the experience of God&rsquo;s children, which makes them golden and transforms them into precious stones for the building up of God&rsquo;s children into one entity. The twelve precious stones set in gold are a miniature of the New Jerusalem. As the aggregate of God&rsquo;s people, the New Jerusalem is built with gold and precious stones. Thus, the use and arrangement of gold and precious stones on the breastplate is a picture of the aggregate of God&rsquo;s people. Through the priesthood, God&rsquo;s people are in the process of becoming gold, of being transformed into precious stones, and of being formed and built together as one entity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Revelation from God</h2>
<p>For the fulfillment of the priestly ministry, the operation of the Urim and the Thummim was needed in order to reveal God&rsquo;s intention (v. 30). When God&rsquo;s people contact Him and enjoy the riches of Christ, His people are built together, and their expression is one of gold and precious stones. This expression reveals God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Heart&rsquo;s Desire<br />
Being Entrusted to Priests</h2>
<p>Every person gained by God through His redemption should be a priest. God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire has been entrusted to the priesthood. God&rsquo;s desire is to be life in His Son through the Spirit so that we may become gold and precious stones to be built up together to express His image and represent His authority. All the details related to God&rsquo;s desire are realized through the priesthood. God&rsquo;s desire in the universe will be accomplished only when He gains the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OFFICES OF THE PRIESTHOOD, THE KINGSHIP, AND THE PROPHETHOOD</h2>
<p>We will now consider the three offices in the Bible&mdash;the priesthood, the kingship, and prophethood. The Old Testament can be divided into three parts: the first part, the Pentateuch, concerns the priesthood; the second part, the middle section of the Old Testament, concerns the kingship; and the final part, the last section of the Old Testament, consisting of the books of the prophets, concerns the prophethood. In presenting these three offices, the Bible first speaks of the priesthood, not the kingship. This shows God&rsquo;s desire to have the priesthood with the kingship. David was brought in as the king through Samuel the priest. The New Testament similarly reveals a relationship between the priesthood and the kingship among the believers. First Peter 2:9 says, &ldquo;You are...a royal priesthood,&rdquo; and Revelation 5:10 speaks of the believers as being &ldquo;a kingdom and priests,&rdquo; who will reign on the earth. Hence, the kingship accompanies the priesthood; authority is related to image. Only a person who bears God&rsquo;s image can exercise God&rsquo;s authority. The kingship exists because there is the priesthood, and authority can be exercised when there is image. The priesthood brings in kingship, and image brings in authority. This thought runs throughout the Bible.</p>
<p>However, when man becomes desolate due to weaknesses and shortcomings, God brings in the last office, the prophethood. The prophethood is supplementary and remedial; it is not something that is needed in a normal situation. If our condition is normal, there is no need for the prophethood. In fact, the New Testament clearly states that prophecies will be rendered useless, but that the priesthood with the kingship will exist eternally (1 Cor. 13:8; Rev. 22:3-5).</p>
<p>All the books of the prophets reflect situations involving desolation, and every book is filled with words of rebuke. Even though most readers of the Bible agree that Isaiah, the first of the books of the prophets, is a book of the gospel in the Old Testament, the first chapter of Isaiah still contains a strong rebuke. The prophet Isaiah called the people of Israel a &ldquo;sinful nation, / A people heavy with iniquity, / Seed of evildoers, / Children acting corruptly!&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Unless Jehovah of hosts / Had left to us a surviving few, / We would have been like Sodom, / We would have resembled Gomorrah&rdquo; (vv. 4, 9). This is the background of Isaiah&rsquo;s speaking. The priesthood had been abandoned, and the kingship was deformed. Hence, there was a need for the prophethood.</p>
<p>Prophets were needed because the priests and the kings were not functioning normally. If the kings had been reigning in a proper way, there would have been no need for the prophets. Before David sinned, the matter of his kingship was primary, even though he had some function as a prophet (Acts 2:30). When he went astray, however, God had to raise up a strong prophet, Nathan, to correct him (2 Sam. 12:1-15). This shows that the prophethood was needed to remedy the problems of the kingship. However, when the condition of the priesthood was normal, the speaking of God through the Urim and the Thummim was sufficient, and there was no need for God to speak through the prophets.</p>
<p>David was at his best in his function as a king when he wore an ephod of a priest to receive the Ark. In this instance the offices of the priesthood and the kingship were combined in David (6:14). David was a king, but at the same time he was acting as a priest. He was a royal priest. Before these two offices were combined in the Lord Jesus as the counsel of peace, they were combined in David, who was a type of the Lord Jesus. God did not condemn David for wearing an ephod, because this was normal in His eyes. When the condition of David was normal, he was also a priest; knowing God&rsquo;s will did not require a prophet, because the priests had the Urim and the Thummim. The prophethood was raised up only because there was desolation in the priesthood and the kingship.</p>
<p>In regard to the prophethood, however, we must be clear that there is a difference between prophets sent by God and those who proclaim themselves to be prophets, that is, those whose &ldquo;prophethood&rdquo; comes from man. Elijah and Elisha were prophets sent by God, but there were others who were not really prophets, who were prophets only according to man. In the early church there surely were prophets sent by God who bore God&rsquo;s authority. However, the church has become so desolate today because there is a lack of service related to the priesthood and the kingship. For the most part, there are only prophets&mdash;some who have been sent by God but many who have only proclaimed themselves to be prophets. In today&rsquo;s Christianity it is as if there are no priests and kings, no temple and altar; there are only prophets. Among these prophets, only a small number have been sent by God.</p>
<p>When the condition of the priesthood and the kingship was normal, the most prominent item among God&rsquo;s people was the temple. However, when the prophets were ministering, the temple was in complete desolation. The fact that people today do not like to talk about the church is a proof that the temple, the priesthood, and the kingship have become desolate. Where can we find the temple when there is no priesthood? The priesthood and the temple cannot be separated. Today the priesthood has become fallen and desolate, and although the prophethood is functioning, the temple has been abandoned. Some &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; think that it is sufficient to have only the ministry of the word, because they are rendering help to others. They do not see that this speaks of a situation of desolation. Many people can see the preciousness of the prophethood but not the situation of desolation that brought forth a need for the prophethood. Consequently, many want to be prophets, and even schools have been established to mass produce prophets. We have been affected by this because some among us aspire only to be ministers of the word.</p>
<p>On one hand, we treasure that God has raised up ministers of the word in this age of desolation, but on the other hand, we are grieved, because ministers of the word are raised up only when there is a lack of priests. Elijah and Elisha sounded out a cry because there was a lack of the service in the temple. I believe that God&rsquo;s only intention today is to recover the priesthood. God does not want to tear down those who are ministers of the word; however, a minister of the word should also be a priest. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah, the prophets who participated in the recovery of the building of the temple and who brought God&rsquo;s people out of desolation, were also priests. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah were related either directly or indirectly to the recovery of God&rsquo;s building. Jeremiah prophesied that the Israelites would return from the land of captivity after a period of seventy years. Ezekiel prophesied of a recovered situation when he was in the land of captivity, and Zechariah strengthened the people&rsquo;s hands to recover God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s building. These prophets were priests. I hope that every minister of the word today would also be a priest.</p>
<p>We cannot be content with the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity. We cannot be content that only the prophethood is functioning in the church by giving messages. We should not uplift the ministers of the word. We must share God&rsquo;s feeling. Our heart should grieve that there is a need for strong ministers of the word. Although we should be thankful that God has given us ministers of the word in these times of desolation, we should see that this is not a normal situation. If we read the Bible, we will realize that God&rsquo;s people are in a desolate situation when there are many prophets. If God&rsquo;s people were not in a desolate condition, there would not be much need for ministers of the word.</p>
<p>Some may refer to 1 Corinthians 14:4, which says, &ldquo;He who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; Paul, however, spoke this word because the church was in a childish condition, and there was a need for prophets. If the church had not been so childish, there would not have been such a strong need. Paul also spoke of prophets building up the church, because the Corinthians were paying too much attention to miraculous gifts. For this reason the apostle said that if they desired to pursue gifts, they should pursue the excelling gift of prophesying, of speaking for God, rather than the gifts of speaking in tongues or healing. The most profitable gift that God gives for the building up of the church is prophesying (v. 1), but in a normal situation, the building up of the church is accomplished through the priesthood.</p>
<p>I hope that this light is clear among us. We need a change in our concept in order to not follow the direction that is being taken in Christianity. We should not place so much emphasis on having a small number of saints who can carry out the ministry of the word. We must see the importance of being priests. We need to be personally recovered to the priesthood, and we should help God&rsquo;s children to be recovered to the priesthood. We should lead God&rsquo;s children to live a life in the Holy of Holies so that we can have the reality of the building up of the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
