   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEATH DELIVERS US FROM SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's salvation for man is death!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He who is dead is freed from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to see the verse that precedes the one we just read.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 6:6: "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to take a closer look at this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word "annulled" has two meanings: one is unemployed; the other is paralyzed or crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The idea of unemployment is stronger in this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, we can translate this as "that the body of sin might be unemployed."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>SIN, THE OLD MAN, AND THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are three important agents in this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first is sin, the second is the old man, and the third is the body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sin is personified; it is a master.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This sin does not refer to individual sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it is a powerful lord that binds, entangles, and compels man to commit all of the particular sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man becomes the slave to sin, being subject to such a tyrant and carrying out all its dictates.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Under ordinary circumstances, man does not feel too much pressure from this master.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the minute he makes up his mind to overcome it, he will find that no matter how much energy he summons, he can never succeed in overturning its power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The more he tries to control his temper, the more he will lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sin is the master.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It forces man to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The old man mentioned in the Bible is our own person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Deep in man there is a love for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When temptation comes, man rejoices to hear its call and gladly succumbs to its sway.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is true that sin is a powerful agent, but when it is met by the old man, the result is an instant collaboration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such a setting, the two go about searching for an instrument and discover the body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The body is thus employed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They will either tell the eyes to look, the ears to listen, or the hands to move.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way the body executes the order dictated by sin and seconded by the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin is the director, the old man submits to its orders, and the body carries them out practically in the form of transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They agree with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The product of this collaboration is the multitude of sins that we commit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>ERADICATION OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's salvation is different from our human concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His way is deliverance from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We think that everything would be all right if sins were uprooted from our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But God's salvation is not the eradication of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He does not pull out our sins like uprooted trees.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The eastern mind always thinks that perfection is attained as soon as one has all sins repressed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But our person is one that loves to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It does not even want to suppress sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even when it tries grudgingly, there is no lasting result.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The way of God is not a subjugation of sin, nor is it a mortification of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is an exchange of person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The old man that was attached to sin is removed, and a new life that abhors sin is put in its place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When temptation comes, this new life naturally shuns it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, the body loses its function in regard to performing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>GOD ONLY DEALS WITH THE OLD MAN</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, God's salvation is entirely different from the concepts of other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God does not deal with sin, nor does He touch the body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All He takes care of is the old man within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This old man is just our life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the old man is put to death, it means that the old life is terminated, and a new life is put in its place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The two ends, sin and the body, are left untouched, but the middle agent is taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sin can now no longer communicate with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The man that is constituted with this new life is called the new man in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When temptation comes again, the new man reacts very differently from the old one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He no longer hearkens to those lures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He never seconds the motion of sin, and he never actuates the body to commit evil.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The new man is diametrically opposed to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is deaf to the suggestion of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>UNEMPLOYED IN REGARD TO SIN</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What about the body?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At this point, although the body is still willing to be a slave to sin, the power of the latter is blocked by the new man from being transmitted to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This new man no longer obeys sin or agrees with its proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Under these circumstances, the body has nothing more to do; it becomes unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Formerly, my mouth constantly cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now it does not function that way anymore; it has lost its job.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>My hands that used to fight with others have been discouraged by the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now they no longer fight; they are likewise unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>My eyes, my ears, and even my whole body have become unemployed in regard to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is what the Bible means when it says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It clearly tells us that God deals with the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The result is that the body of sin is unemployed, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>That means we will no longer come under the sway of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We have nothing more to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We can see that the basic strategy in God's salvation is the removal of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our life is just the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In God's eyes this has to die.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If it does not die, it will produce millions of sinful offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It will give birth to jealousy, pride, murder, adultery, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It has an inherent and insatiable love for sin, and no matter how much you suppress it, it will still run after sin.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It takes no effort for it to perform evil, but it is impossible for it to be patient, loving, and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is no other way for God to take but to pronounce death for this life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Its last breath has to be taken from it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It must be utterly terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When this happens sin will lose its partner forever.</S>
