[2]  In 1949 Watchman Nee released a series of messages on authority and submission in a co-workers' training held in Kuling, Foochow.
[3]  All who were present in the meetings fell prostrate in the light of God.
[4]  At the end of this age, how can the kingdom of God be brought in if the children of God do not bear a testimony for the Lord in submission?
[5]  All things have been created by the authority of God, and all laws on earth are held together through authority.
[6]  Hence, the Bible says that God upholds all things by the word, which is of His authority Heb 1:3b .
[7]  It is easy to be forgiven of sin against God's power, but it is not that easy to be forgiven of sin against God's authority, because sinning against God's authority is sinning against God Himself.
[8]  ALL DISPUTES IN THE UNIVERSE BEING A MATTER OF AUTHORITY
[9]  The center of dispute in the whole universe relates to who has the authority.
[10]  We have to contend with Satan by asserting that authority is with God.
[11]  We have to set ourselves to submit to God's authority and to uphold God's authority.
[12]  We should only think of the authority, not of the person, because our submission is not to a person but to God's authority in that person.
[13]  Some have considered the Lord's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, where His sweat fell as blood, as a sign of His weakness in the flesh and His fear of the cup Luke 22:44 .
[14]  To be lawless is to disregard the authority of God, and to disregard the authority of God is sin.
[15]  CHAPTER TWO EXAMPLES OF REBELLION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:16-17; 3:1-6; Rom 5:19 THE FALL OF ADAM AND EVE The Fall of Man Due to Not Submitting
[16]  After Adam was created, God gave him some instructions.
[17]  God entrusted all creation to Adam's authority so that Adam would manage and be the authority over all the creation.
[18]  At the same time, God put Adam under His own authority so that Adam would learn to submit to authority.
[19]  God destined that Adam would be the authority and that Eve would be under Adam's authority.
[20]  Man should not do anything out of a knowledge of right and wrong.
[21]  All authority is from God because everything is ordered by God.
[22]  No Oneness of the Body without the Authority of the Head
[23]  Today God is taking the way of the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ.
[24]  In order to have the oneness of the Body, there must first be the life of the Head and then the authority of the Head.
[25]  A worker of God must not only learn submission to authority; he must also learn to be God's deputy authority in the church and in the home.
[26]  CHAPTER THREE EXAMPLES OF REBELLION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 9:20-27; Lev 10:1-2; Num 12:1-15; 16 THE REBELLION OF HAM The Failure of the Deputy Authority Being a Test to Those Submitting to Authority
[27]  Serving God and offering strange fire are two similar matters, yet they are very different.
[28]  God called all three to come out to the entrance of the tent of meeting v. 4 . Aaron and Miriam came out boldly, presuming that they would be vindicated.
[29]  He did not answer them, but prayed to God instead.
[30]  Moses and Aaron fell down before God and prayed, "Shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the assembly?" v. 22 . God answered Moses and Aaron's prayer and judged only the company of Korah.
[31]  Not only did the Israelites have to hearken to God's appointed authority, but God Himself also testified before the Israelites that He accepted their word.
[32]  Therefore, one must meet authority, be restricted by God, and be led by His deputy authority.
[33]  When the whole assembly attacked Moses and Aaron, the glory of God appeared, proving that authority is from God.
[34]  CHAPTER FOUR DAVID'S KNOWLEDGE OF AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 24:4-6; 26:9, 11; 2 Sam 1:14 DAVID GAINING THE THRONE WITHOUT PAYING THE PRICE OF REBELLION
[35]  During the setting up of the kingdom of Israel, God officially established His authority on earth.
[36]  When the Israelites entered Canaan they asked God for a king, and God sent Samuel to anoint Saul as their first king 1 Sam 10:1 .
[37]  But when he became king, Saul did not submit to the authority of God.
[38]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SON'S SUBMISSION Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5-11; Heb 5:7-9 THE LORD CREATING SUBMISSION
[39]  The Word of God tells us that the Lord Jesus and the Father are one.
[40]  In the beginning was the Word, just as in the beginning there was God.
[41]  THE WAY THE LORD CAME OUT OF HIS DIVINE FORM AND THE WAY HE RETURNED
[42]  Concerning His deity, the Lord was equal with God.
[43]  But His being the Lord was something given to Him by God.
[44]  When He laid aside His divine form to fully maintain the principle of submission and subsequently ascended to the heavens, God accorded to Him the position of Lord.
[45]  But if there was only authority without submission, authority could not be established, because authority is not something isolated.
[46]  CHAPTER SIX HOW GOD ESTABLISHES HIS KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Heb 5:8-9; Acts 5:32; Rom 10:16; 2 Thes 1:8; 1 Pet 1:22 THE LORD LEARNING OBEDIENCE THROUGH SUFFERING
[47]  In this chapter we want to see how God establishes His kingdom through submission.
[48]  Although Satan rebelled against God's authority, and although man daily violates His authority by rebelling against Him, God will not let this rebellion continue.
[49]  After Adam fell, God chose Noah and his family in his generation.
[50]  Not only does God want man to submit to His direct authority, He wants man to submit to all of His appointed, deputy authorities as well.
[51]  GOD DESIRES TO MAKE THE NATIONS THE KINGDOM OF GOD THROUGH THE CHURCH
[52]  If the church does not take God's authority, He has no way to establish His kingdom.
[53]  CHAPTER SEVEN GOD INTENDS THAT MAN SUBMIT TO REPRESENTATIVE AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Rom 13:1; 1 Pet 2:13-14; Eph 5:22-24; 6:1-3; Col 3:18, 20, 22; 1 Thes 5:12-13; 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Pet 5:5; 1 Cor 16:15-16 THE GOD-ESTABLISHED SYSTEMS OF AUTHORITY In the World
[54]  In the universe God is the source of all authorities.
[55]  As such, they represent God's authority and even possess God's authority.
[56]  God Himself has set up systems of authorities for His expression so that when man meets these authorities he will meet God Himself.
[57]  After entrusting man with authority, many on earth have been set up by God to manifest His authority.
[58]  Not only do we have to submit to God's direct authority, we must also submit to His deputy authority because there is no authority that is not from God.
[59]  Although they do not believe in God, and although their entire kingdoms are under Satan, the principle of authority is still there, having been established by God.
[60]  Many children of God do not pay enough attention to the matter of the family.
[61]  Unless the wife sees the authority that the husband represents, the authority that God has set up, it is difficult for her to submit.
[62]  Not only has God set up His deputy authority in the universe, He has also set up His authority in the spiritual world.
[63]  WE SHOULD HAVE CONFIDENCE IN SUBMITTING TO THE DELEGATED AUTHORITY
[64]  It is much easier for us to be confident in submitting to representative authorities than for God to be confident in setting them up.
[65]  Since God is confident in handing over authority to man, should we not be confident in submitting to man?
[66]  The whole parable in Luke 20:9-16 is on deputy authority.
[67]  God leased the vineyard to the vinedresser, but He did not come to personally collect the rent.
[68]  Other than in Acts 9:4-15, which speaks of the Lord's direct authority, the Lord entrusts His authority to deputy authorities in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[69]  But if the deputy authority is wrong, God will deal with him; he will have to bear the iniquity of his wife, and the submitting wife is guiltless v. 15 . This chapter tells us that man cannot overstep the deputy authority to submit to the direct authority.
[70]  CHAPTER EIGHT AUTHORITY IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:12-21; Matt 18:15-18 THE BODY BEING THE PLACE FOR THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF AUTHORITY
[71]  Although God has established systems of authority in the world, none of the relationships with the government or between father and son, husband and wife, and master and servant can perfectly manifest authority.
[72]  Although God has set up many authorities on earth, they are but systems of authority set up by God.
[73]  IT BEING MOST SPONTANEOUS AND HARMONIOUS FOR THE BODY TO SUBMIT TO THE HEAD
[74]  This is why God first works thoroughly on the people who are used by Him so that when He gives them to us as our authority to help us learn submission, we can receive what we never could have otherwise received.
[75]  For unbelievers and Israelites, submission is a difficult matter because they are not related to other unbelievers and Israelites in life.
[76]  CHAPTER NINE THE MANIFESTATION OF MAN'S REBELLION 1 Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 2:10-12; Eph 5:6; Jude 8-10; Matt 12:34; Rom 9:11-24
[77]  Rebellion Being Related to the Walking after the Lust in the Flesh
[78]  If we know God, we will be repentant and remorseful, because we will realize how much God hates this.
[79]  If a man does not know authority, there will be reviling words.
[80]  In Romans 9 Paul tried to prove to the Jews that God has called the Gentiles also.
[81]  God will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion.
[82]  We have to realize that God sits on His throne of glory, and man is under His authority.
[83]  Paul went on to say, "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy" v. 16 . God said of Pharaoh, "For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power" v. 17 . Moreover, He said that "He hardens whom He wills" v. 18 . To harden does not mean to cause to sin.
[84]  CHAPTER TEN THE MANIFESTATION OF MAN'S REBELLION 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 10:4-6 THOUGHTS The Relationship between Reasons and Thoughts
[85]  Not only is man's rebellion manifested in his words and reasons; it is manifested in his thoughts as well.
[86]  He was capable and confident in his work, and served God with his own zeal.
[87]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE PROPER LIMIT OF SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Heb 11:23; Exo 1:17; Dan 3:17-18; 6:10; Matt 2:13; Acts 5:29 SUBMISSION BEING ABSOLUTE, BUT OBEDIENCE BEING RELATIVE
[88]  Submission is a matter of attitude, but obedience is a matter of conduct.
[89]  Acts 4:19 says, "But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you judge."
[90]  1 The midwives and the mother of Moses disobeyed the order of Pharaoh so that the life of Moses could be preserved.
[91]  If a man has not met authority and does not know the principle of submission to authority, he cannot bring others into the way of submission and authority.
[92]  God's children must learn to know authority and find out to whom they should submit.
[93]  Wherever we go, the first thing we should ask is whose authority should we be under.
[94]  He also begets His children with His authority John 1:12 and binds them together with His authority.
[95]  Therefore, if a man is independent, individualistic, and free from any God-appointed deputy authority, he is an outsider as far as God's administration over the whole universe is concerned.
[96]  God has established deputy authorities in the church; the church is built up and maintained by the authority of God.
[97]  For this reason every child of God should look for the authority to whom he should submit so that he can coordinate with others in a proper way.
[98]  Today we will consider the kind of persons God uses to be His deputy authorities.
[99]  In order to be God's deputy authority, a person must fulfill three fundamental requirements in addition to knowing God's authority and submitting to His authority .
[100]  A deputy authority must remember that all authorities come from God.
[101]  In fact, the only authority that is authority at all is the authority that comes from God, and only such authority can claim submission from others.
[102]  God appoints a person to be a deputy authority because such a person knows His will and His thoughts more than others, not because he has more suggestions, better ideas, or higher thoughts.
[103]  Every time that you have to deal with someone, you must have the assurance from God that you understand His will and that you know what God wants to do in that instance.
[104]  If God does not acknowledge what you have said to the brothers, you will be left representing only yourself, not God.
[105]  If we have sufficient experience before the Lord, and if we have sufficiently learned His ways, we will have the boldness to declare that this is what we know from God, that this is what we have learned of Him, and that this is what we have experienced in Him.
[106]  The second basic requirement of a deputy authority is to deny himself.
[107]  Before one is clear about God's will, he should not open his mouth and should not exercise any authority.
[108]  God's deputy authority must not only know His authority on the positive side, but must learn to deny himself on the negative side.
[109]  In the same way, God does not ask a person who loves to express his opinion to be His deputy authority, because He does not want to suffer loss either.
[110]  God wants us to represent His authority, not replace His authority.
[111]  Those who are God's deputy authorities should possess a third qualification they must have a constant and intimate fellowship with the Lord.
[112]  Every time one has an opinion, he has to bring it to the Lord and find out if such an opinion is of the flesh or of God.
[113]  If God has arranged for us to bear some authority and learn to be a deputy authority, we have to learn to live before Him and have constant fellowship with Him.
[114]  Since God is the One who establishes authority, there is no need for deputy authorities to try to build up their own authority.
[115]  I know of a few brothers and sisters who were so foolish in the past that they thought they could direct others with their authority.
[116]  On the other hand, if I am an authority appointed by God, why do I have to worry that others will not submit to me?
[117]  We must allow God to establish every authority, and we must not try to build up any authority of our own.
[118]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE BASIS OF GOD'S DEPUTY AUTHORITY REVELATION Scripture Reading: Exo 3:1-12; Num 12:1-15
[119]  In the Old Testament the greatest authority God appointed was Moses.
[120]  Before Moses was appointed by God to be the authority, he killed an Egyptian who had slain one of his kinsmen.
[121]  God may have committed His authority to us, but if we vindicate ourselves before men, we have lost our authority because we are begging them to be our judge.
[122]  In Numbers 12:2 God heard the reviling words, and He took action in verse 4.
[123]  But there is a parenthetical word in verse 3: "Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all the men who were on the face of the earth."
[124]  This is what we find in a God-appointed deputy authority.
[125]  God does not appoint persons of great charisma to be His authority; He appoints those who are not only meek in a general way, but meek to the extent that their meekness exceeds that of all the men who are on the face of the earth.
[126]  All three came before the tent of meeting, and Jehovah said to Aaron and Miriam, "Hear My words" v. 6a . They first questioned if it was fair that God only spoke to Moses, and now God summoned them to hear His words too.
[127]  But God said that even if there were a prophet, God would at most speak to him in a vision or in a dream v. 6c . But with Moses, God spoke mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in obscure words v. 8 . This was God's vindication.
[128]  In Numbers 12:7, God said, "My servant Moses is faithful in all My house."
[129]  Hebrews shows us that Moses, as a type of Christ the Son of God, was faithful in all God's house 3:2 .
[130]  God seemed to be hinting at Aaron and Miriam, saying, "Moses might not have been altogether faithful in your house when he married a Cushite woman.
[131]  If others oppose and rebel against you, and if they go to God and also receive revelation, it means that God has not vindicated you or backed you up.
[132]  If you understand what is God's authority and God's way, you will realize what I have been saying repeatedly, that is, when others argue with you, they are arguing with God, because you are God's possession.
[133]  Had Moses not received mercy and had he been ignorant of God's grace, he would have said to Aaron, "Since you have said that God should speak to you also, why don't you pray to God yourself?"
[134]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE CHARACTER OF GOD'S DEPUTY AUTHORITY GRACIOUS TO OTHERS Scripture Reading: Num 16 HOW MOSES DEALT WITH REBELLION
[135]  No rebellion among the children of Israel was as great as the one recorded in Numbers 16.
[136]  While God was about to execute His judgment, Moses said, "In this shall you know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own mind" v. 28 . Moses was a meek person.
[137]  Moses was sent by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, just as Christ was sent by God to impart eternal life to men.
[138]  Authority is established by God, and when a man offends God's authority, he is despising God.
[139]  When God looks for deputy authority, He considers not only a person's individual submission to Him but his reaction to others' opposition in his service as a deputy authority.
[140]  THE CHARACTER OF THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY GRACIOUS TO OTHERS
[141]  When you set out for your work this time, you have to learn from Moses.
[142]  If we will truly bear the burden of the church and the children of God, and if we will learn to prostrate ourselves before the Lord, God will find His deputy authority on earth today.
[143]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE BASIS OF GOD'S DEPUTY AUTHORITY RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Num 17
[144]  The purpose of Numbers 17 is to show us the way God dealt with Israel's rebellion.
[145]  Aaron could not serve God based on his position, because his position was the same as all the others.
[146]  Resurrection is everything that is not out of our natural life, not out of ourselves, and not based on our ability.
[147]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE MISUSE OF DEPUTY AUTHORITY AND GOD'S GOVERNMENTAL JUDGMENT Scripture Reading: Num 20:2-3, 7-13, 22-28; Deut 32:48-52 A DEPUTY AUTHORITY SHOULD SANCTIFY THE LORD
[148]  After the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for over thirty years, we find in Numbers 20 that they forgot the lesson that they had learned through their rebellion.
[149]  God was not angry this time at the people's murmuring; He told Moses to take the rod, which was a symbol of God's authority, and to speak to the rock so that it might yield its water.
[150]  We can never implicate God in our mistakes or our personal failures, or give others the impression that our attitude is the attitude that God is expressing through His deputy authority.
[151]  God said that Moses and Aaron could no longer enter the land of Canaan on account of their mistake v. 12b . When man speaks and acts loosely and does not sanctify God, He will vindicate Himself.
[152]  When this happens, man can no longer ask God for forgiveness.
[153]  Here is another thing that we should note: Every time we execute God's authority and take care of His business, we have to do it with fear and trembling.
[154]  When Moses was angry and threw down God's handwritten tablets of stone, God did not judge him because he was filled with God's jealousy, and it was right for him to do that.
[155]  But after following God for so many years, he misrepresented God by disobeying Him, striking the rock twice, and speaking rash words.
[156]  He had incriminated God in his mistakes, and he had dragged God into his error.
[157]  In Numbers 18 God told Aaron that he and his sons would bear the iniquity of the sanctuary v. 1 . The more a person represents God's authority, the more God scrutinizes him and will not let him go.
[158]  Even though he was a deputy authority of God who was obedient to God all his life, he was barred from entering Canaan because of his one failure in representing God.
[159]  A DEPUTY AUTHORITY CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE A MISTAKE
[160]  Self-motivated service cannot find acceptance in the eyes of God.
[161]  The Lord does not want us to be misguided to assume that authority comes from someone other than God.
[162]  When a deputy authority makes a mistake, God will step forward to judge it.
[163]  God is willing to commit His name to us; He has allowed us to use His name, just as a man commits his personal seal to another and allows the latter to use it in his name.
[164]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE NEED FOR A DEPUTY AUTHORITY TO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 24:1-6; 26:7-12; 2 Sam 1:5-15; 2:1; 4:5 5:3; 6:16-23; 7:18; 15:19-20, 24-26; 16:5-14; 19:9-15
[165]  In the Old Testament David was the second king appointed by God.
[166]  Before David there was Saul, who was also appointed by God.
[167]  Here we see how David submitted to authority and how he did not build up his own authority.
[168]  THE MORE A PERSON IS AN AUTHORITY, THE MORE HE UPHOLDS AUTHORITY
[169]  David waited in Hebron for seven and a half years because Ishbosheth, Saul's son, continued to be king in Mahanaim after Saul's death 2 Sam 2:8-9 .
[170]  The less a man seeks for authority, the more God gives him authority.
[171]  A deputy authority should take a place before God that is as equally low and humble as all the people of God.
[172]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE LIFE AND HEART OF A DEPUTY AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Mark 10:35-45 DRINKING THE LORD'S CUP AND PARTAKING OF HIS BAPTISM
[173]  When the Lord was on the earth, He rarely taught others how to be an authority.
[174]  This is because His goal on earth was not to establish authority among men.
[175]  Clearly the baptism that the Lord referred to was not the baptism at the river Jordan, because that was over.
[176]  There are two aspects to the cross the aspect of redemption and the aspect of life-releasing.
[177]  In Mark 10:35-45 the Lord did not speak of His death; He only spoke of His baptism, because He did not want others to think that James and John could participate in His redemptive work.
[178]  There is much contention between those who have the Lord and those who do not, those who know God and those who do not, those who pay the price and those who do not, those who are faithful and those who are not, and those who accept the trials and those who do not.
[179]  But even if they drank His cup and passed through His baptism, they still might not sit on His right or left, because the latter depends on God's preparation v. 40 . If a man does not drink the Lord's cup and is not baptized with His baptism, he will surely not be able to sit on His right or left side.
[180]  AN AUTHORITY DOES NOT DOMINATE OR CONTROL, BUT HUMBLES HIMSELF TO SERVE
[181]  WHOEVER WANTING TO BECOME GREAT SHALL BE THE SERVANT, AND WHOEVER WANTING TO BE FIRST SHALL BE THE SLAVE
[182]  The Lord uses the phrase among you three times.
[183]  Today the Lord is establishing authority in the church.
[184]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE NEED OF A DEPUTY AUTHORITY TO SANCTIFY HIMSELF Scripture Reading: John 17:19
[185]  We have seen that spiritual authority depends on spiritual attainment.
[186]  Please remember that authority is based on attainment on the one hand and on humility and obedience before God on the other hand.
[187]  Although our Lord was sent from God and had uninterrupted fellowship with God, He said, "For their sake I sanctify Myself" John 17:19 .
[188]  In order for us to learn to be an authority, we must also learn to set ourselves apart from the brothers and sisters.
[189]  AN AUTHORITY MUST SANCTIFY HIMSELF IN HIS LIVING AND HIS ENJOYMENT
[190]  According to Leviticus 10:9, God told Aaron, "Do not drink wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting."
[191]  The more we are sanctified and the more we are restricted by God and bound under His authority, the more we can be an authority.
[192]  CHAPTER TWENTY THE REQUIREMENTS OF A DEPUTY AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Eph 5:22, 25, 28, 33; 6:1, 4, 9; Psa 82:1-2; 1 Tim 4:12; 3:4-6; Titus 2:15; 1:6-8; 1 Pet 1:21
[193]  HOW GOD DEALS WITH THE MISTAKES OF THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY
[194]  Numbers 30:13 tells us how God upholds His appointed deputy authority.
