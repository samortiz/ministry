   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Feeling of the Conscience 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Origin of the Feeling</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Throughout generations, all saints who have been seeking life agree that the conscience is the window of our spirit just as the eye is the window of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The window itself has no light; all light is transmitted from another source.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So also is the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we dare not say that the conscience itself has no feeling at all, we can say that the greater portion of its feelings comes from its neighboring parts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are a total of seven of these neighboring parts: the mind, the emotion, the will, the intuition, the fellowship, the life of God, and the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these seven neighboring parts have feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When their feelings penetrate into the conscience, they become the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the origin of the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Different Kinds of Feelings</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The feelings of the conscience of the saints are of many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One who has a keen conscience will have the feelings of conscience in all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These feelings of the conscience can be divided into three categories: First is the feeling toward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the chapter concerning dealing with sin we have said that the basis of dealing with sin is the inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This inner consciousness is the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we sin before God or before man, the conscience will immediately have the feeling of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the first category of the feelings of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second category is the feeling toward the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the chapter concerning dealing with the world we have said that the basis for dealing with the world is also the inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This inner consciousness is still the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we love other matters or are occupied with anything outside of God, the conscience will also give us a feeling of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the second category of the feelings of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Beside these two categories of the feelings of the conscience, there is a third category: these are the uneasy feelings concerning anything apart from sin and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are certain matters that are neither sinful nor of the world, yet they cause our conscience to lose the feeling of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not deal with these matters, we simply cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, looseness and inaccuracy in our daily living are not sin nor of the world, yet our conscience is disturbed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If someone scatters clothing and other articles around, leaving the room in a state of disorder, his conscience will rebuke him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If our character has certain shortcomings or peculiarities, if our behavior toward others is unbecoming as a Christian, or if before God we have certain undesirable or unsuitable attitudes, though they are neither sinful nor worldly, our conscience is bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All these uneasy feelings belong to the third category of the feelings of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Among the three categories of the feelings of the conscience, the first two concerning sin and the world are superficial, whereas the third is deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the early stage of dealing with the conscience, our inner feelings are more or less sensitive toward sin and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we have dealt with all of these feelings, the third category of feeling will be made manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more severely and thoroughly we deal with our conscience, the more this third category of feeling is increased.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our emphasis in dealing with the conscience is upon the issue of our coming to deal with this third category of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since the conscience of a Christian includes these three categories of feelings, his conscience is richer and keener than that of the unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>An unbeliever has no feeling concerning the world and none of the uneasiness of the third category.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He only has a feeling concerning sin, a feeling of right and wrong, good and evil; and even this feeling is quite dull.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The feeling in the unbeliever's conscience is about one-third of that in the Christian's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The feeling in the Christian's conscience is so rich because the heart of the Christian is a new heart, a heart which has been softened and renewed by God; his spirit is a new spirit, a spirit which has been revived and renewed by God; his mind, emotion, and will have also been considerably renewed; and he has as well the life of God and the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These are all rich in feeling and can influence the conscience of the Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason the feelings of a Christian's conscience are indeed rich!</S>
