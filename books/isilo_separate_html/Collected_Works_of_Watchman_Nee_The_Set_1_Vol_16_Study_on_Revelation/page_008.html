Seven Calls</H2><P>Every epistle contains the words, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). These seven epistles are spoken by the Lord Himself. Why then do they say that the Spirit speaks to the churches? Because the Lord spoke directly to John, the churches could only read the epistles which John had written. Therefore, in reading, there was the need of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in order to understand. Moreover, when the Lord was on the earth, He did not speak by Himself but through the Spirit. Even today, the Lord is still speaking through the Spirit. Therefore, Revelation says that the Spirit is speaking to the churches.</P><P>Now we will consider the content of these seven epistles in detail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE CHURCH IN EPHESUS<br>(REVELATION 2:1-7)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 2:1</H2><P>"To the messenger of the church in Ephesus write: These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands."</P><P>"Write." John is the Lord's secretary, recording the words of the Lord.</P><P>"The church in Ephesus." The church has two aspects: one is the mystical church; the other is the local church. One is the Body of Christ; the other is the house of God. The churches which are mentioned in these two chapters are churches which belong to localities. "The church in Ephesus" is different from "the church of Ephesus" because the church in Ephesus merely resides in Ephesus; it does not belong to Ephesus. Therefore, the so-called Roman Church, Greek Church, and Chinese Christian Church are all unscriptural.</P><P>"To the messenger." This epistle is given to the messenger. This indicates that it is much inferior to the book to the Ephesians written by Paul, because Paul wrote to all the believers. From this we can see that many of the believers at that time had passed away or backslidden. Hence, only the messenger could receive this epistle. When we further compare the content of these two epistles, we can realize that the earlier and latter conditions of this church were very different. Ephesus had definitely become loose and desolate and had backslidden.</P><P>To this church the Lord presents Himself as "He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands." This is to make the church in Ephesus and the messenger know that He has full authority; He searches the whole church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 2:2-3</H2><P>"I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false; and you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary."</P><P>This section is the Lord's word of praise. This section of praise is divided into three aspects:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Concerning Them</H2><P>"Your works." Their works must have been very good.</P><P>"Your labor." They must have labored diligently.</P><P>"Your endurance." This church had the heart of a father or mother in bearing others' weaknesses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Concerning the Administration of the Church</H2><P>"You cannot bear evil men." See 1 Corinthians 5.</P><P>"You have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not." They did not loosely receive people into the work. Even if one was an apostle, he still needed to be tried. From this we see that they had much spiritual insight.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Concerning the Outward Work</H2><P>They endured for the Lord's name and did not grow weary.</P><P>Judging from only the items mentioned above, the church in Ephesus was indeed quite perfect.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
