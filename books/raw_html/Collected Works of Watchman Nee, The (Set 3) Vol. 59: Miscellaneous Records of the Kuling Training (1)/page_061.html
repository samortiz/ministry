<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE MEMBERS BEING<br />THE AUTHORITY OF THE MEMBERS</h2><p>In the Body, life and authority are one. This is a most harmonious union. Where the oneness of the Body is, there the authority of the Body is. The function possessed by a member of the Body becomes his authority. There are many things which we do not have to experience ourselves; we only need to submit to those who have experienced them. If I am a hand, I should realize that I am not made to see. Therefore, I have to acknowledge the function of the eyes. If I am a foot, I should realize that I am not made to hear; I have to accept the function of the ears. The problem today is that some want to take the place of the eyes even though they are hands. Others want to take over the function of the ears even though they are legs. Two years ago five brothers were studying a certain portion of the Scripture in my living room. One was an ear, but he wanted to express something. Another was a nose, yet he also wanted to say a few words. It was like the five fingers of the hand conducting a conference among themselves to discuss the color of a pair of eyeglasses. In the end there were five conclusions, and all of them were wrong. We are the Body of Christ, and we can only see through the eyes that God has ordained. If we are not the eyes, we should not insist on seeing everything ourselves. The so-called "seeing" of many people is actually the "touching" of their hands. Day after day God's children are touching colors with their hands. It is no wonder that so many heresies have been produced during the past two thousand years. They all came about when men considered the touching of their hands to be the seeing of their eyes. One portion of the Scripture might not have a definitive judgment if three or five brothers studied it for twenty years. But another brother may be able to give a judgment immediately. If we are a leg, it is wrong for us to do the things that belong to the hand. If we are willing to accept the other members, we will receive the riches of the entire Body. It is easy for the eyes to identify black and white. The hand only needs to accept and submit, and it will receive what the eyes see. If a man is willing to submit to the authority of all the members, he will receive the riches of all the members. God's children are poor because they have not submitted to authority. Christians today want to see everything for themselves. But one cannot do everything by himself. If all the members in the church together possess the riches of the entire Christ, the fullness of the Body of Christ as mentioned in Ephesians will be easily realized. When the eyes are single, the whole body is bright. The eyes can take care of the scenery; there is no need for the ears to try to see. They only need to accept the seeing of the eyes and enjoy this seeing. The ears listen to music, and neither the hands nor the eyes have to listen, yet both share the same enjoyment.</p><p>A member cannot say, "I will only submit to the Head; I will not submit to the other members." Just as a man should not rebel and oppose the Head presumptuously, he should not oppose the members. No one dares challenge the Lord's authority. So if all the members are obedient to the Lord's authority, they should be all the more obedient to the authority of the members with whom they are coordinated. If a member insists on seeing everything himself, he is in rebellion. If one member refuses to receive supply from another member, he is rebelling against the latter because he does not yield to the Lord's coordination. Our body is not like the central switchboard of a telephone system, where every terminal is directly related to just the switchboard. The Lord's authority is manifested in two areas in the Body. In the first the Lord speaks to a member directly. In the second He uses one member to supply another member. In both cases there is the exercise of authority. When the eyes see, they see under the direct supervision of the Head. For the eyes to see is for the whole Body to see. All the members of the Body should submit to the seeing of the eyes. As far as the eyes are concerned, they are supplying. As far as the other members are concerned, they are subjecting themselves to the authority of the Head. What the eyes see, the whole Body sees. This is indirect authority, or deputy authority. Remember, however, that deputy authority is the same as the authority of the Head. It is rebellion for a person to rebel against the Head directly. It is also rebellion for a person to reject the supply of the members or the deputized authority. Once we submit to visible authority, there will be no barrier between us and the Head. When we submit to the other members, we remove all barriers that exist between us and the Head; we become one with the Head. Therefore, the supply a member renders is the authority he possesses. All other members have to submit to him and receive from him.</p>
