   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WORK OF THE LIGHT OF LIFE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a certainty that the most purified person is the one who can pray the most effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you ask me, "Who are the most purified ones in the universe?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I would reply, "They are those who can pray the most effectively."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The degree of your competency in prayer before God is determined by the degree of your purity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more competent you are in prayer, the more evident it is that you are living in the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The light of life working in us always starts on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It shines and fixes itself upon us, not merely enlightening us on the surface, but much more, penetrating deeply into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is as if the light is able to split open our inner parts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This light penetrating into our depths not only exposes every little error in our action and attitude but touches the very root of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It touches our motive, our intention, the depths of our spirit, and the very source of all that issues from us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It can reveal whether or not our spirit is calm and pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we may not be wrong, unclean, or sinful outwardly, we may still be neither calm nor pliable inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once the light of life shines on these things, they are immediately exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone who truly learns to pray before God must be enlightened, and he must deal with himself severely under such a light.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is in such a light of life that we are able to learn deep, fine, and valuable lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our experience tells us that this penetrating light will illuminate us to a point where we feel that there is no place in the universe for us to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, and only then, can we know what it means to have nothing to be proud of or to boast about.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only then do we appreciate the fact that our only place of refuge is His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our intention, our motive, our purpose, the spirit within, the inner source, will all be made manifest by the light.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the light illuminates, there are a number of feelings and experiences which are simply indescribable with human words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, brothers and sisters, prayer is not a matter of how many answers you have obtained or how much faith you have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, it is a matter of how much you live in the illumination of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many praise Brother M ller, who established orphan ages and had 1,500,000 prayers answered in his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many praise him as a man of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, when I read M ller's diaries, I was not as impressed by his faith as by the fact that he lived entirely in the illumination of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My first impression was not that he had great faith, but that here was a man who whenever he went before God was scrutinized by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As God scrutinized and illuminated him, he uttered some prayers under the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Spontaneously, it was very easy for him to have faith and equally easy for his prayers to be answered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In prayer, therefore, faith is not the most important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first thing to learn is to be worked on by the illumination of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must allow it to expose you to the extent that nothing in your being remains hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even you yourself have no place in which to hide.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For in the light you have discovered that your whole being is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no way for you to burn the incense before God because your inner condition is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At this point you know that your only place of refuge is the blood which was shed on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is here that, in a practical way, you experience the preciousness of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And then by your experience you really know the meaning of the words in 1 John chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You know what it means when it says that God is light, and what it means to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You know what it means to be cleansed by the blood of Jesus, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the first aspect of the work of the life illumination in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please remember that all those who are competent in prayer are those who prostrate themselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This prostration is entirely due to the illumination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before men you may be proud and unwilling to throw yourself to the ground, but you cannot help but prostrate yourself before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such prostrating is not merely being knocked down by God outwardly or being subdued by God's environmental discipline, but it is the inner illumination that has prostrated you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Strictly speaking, God's environmental discipline still cannot prostrate you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is always the light's illuminating that prostrates you.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of course, some also need the help of the outward discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Consequently, you discover that your only trust is in the blood, and thus you become one who is prostrated to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your entire being has no escape before God, and you can only hide yourself under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, you are able to pray.</S>
