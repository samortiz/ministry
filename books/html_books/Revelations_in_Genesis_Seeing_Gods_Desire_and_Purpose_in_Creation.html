<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>Brother Witness Lee conducted a three-month life training in Taipei beginning in October 1954. One of the training classes was on the line of life in the Bible. This book is a collection of edited notes from this class and covers the first part of that study of Genesis.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S CREATION AND SATAN&rsquo;S REBELLION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:1&mdash;2:3</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLE REVEALING CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals God, and it is the revelation of God. This revealed God is life, and life is the goal of everything that He does. Hence, we should take life as the central line when we read the Bible. For this reason, these chapters will not focus on interpretation or doctrines. Instead, we will consider the line of life in the Bible according to the essence of the Bible. If we read the Bible according to the line of life, we will see that the whole Bible reveals Christ as life. The first part of the Bible, the Old Testament, concerns the need for Christ to be life, and the second part of the Bible, the New Testament, concerns Christ being life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE AND PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 is a record of God&rsquo;s creation of the universe. Apparently, this portion reveals the existence of the universe and the origin of everything in it. This record of creation, however, is but a background, a footnote, that reveals God&rsquo;s desire and purpose. Hence, when we read the record of God&rsquo;s creation, we must not stop with the facts in Genesis but rather refer to the whole Bible in order to gain a thorough understanding of creation. In the first three chapters of this book we will first consider the process of God&rsquo;s creation. Then we will consider God&rsquo;s desire and purpose according to the spiritual significance of the process of creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ORIGINAL CREATION</h2>
<p>Many Bible scholars acknowledge that the record of God&rsquo;s creation in Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 should be divided into two sections. In other words, the universe came into being through a two-step process, which includes God&rsquo;s original creation and His restoring and further creation.</p>
<p>Genesis is very brief concerning God&rsquo;s original creation. It only says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (1:1). However, we can see more concerning creation from other books of the Bible. We need to consider five points concerning God&rsquo;s original creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Motive for Creation</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s creation was not a sudden thought. The first sentence in the Bible is very brief, but Ephesians 1:5 and 9 reveal that God&rsquo;s creation came out of His good pleasure, His desire. In eternity past God had a desire, a good pleasure, to gain a universe in which He would accomplish His purpose. Such a desire and good pleasure became His motive for creating the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Purpose of Creation</h2>
<p>God was not aimless when He created the universe; He had a purpose. Colossians reveals that all things were created in the Son of God&rsquo;s love, Christ: &ldquo;All things have been created through Him and unto Him. And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him;...that He Himself might have the first place in all things&rdquo; (1:16-18). This shows that God&rsquo;s purpose for creating the universe is to glorify His Son. Verse 9 of chapter 2 says, &ldquo;In Him [Christ] dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ, the Son&rsquo;s being glorified is the Father&rsquo;s being expressed. Hence, the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation is to glorify His Son. When the Son of God is glorified, God is expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Basis of Creation</h2>
<p>God had a motive and a purpose for creation, and He also had a basis for creation. Revelation 4:11 says that all things were and were created because of God&rsquo;s will. Based on His will, God planned creation. Hence, God created all things based on His will and plan. God had many considerations before He created the universe. He did not create the universe in haste. He had a motive, a purpose, and a basis for His creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Means of Creation</h2>
<p>The Hebrew word for <em>created</em> in Genesis 1:1 is <em>bara,</em> and it means to bring something into existence out of nothing. God&rsquo;s original creation was brought into existence out of nothing. How did God create the universe? What was the means by which the universe was created? Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;The universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; John 1:1-3 also says that all things came into being through the Word. God spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood (Psa. 33:9). God created the universe out of nothing by means of His word. God&rsquo;s word is mighty.</p>
<p>The Word of God is the Son of God. The Son of God is the Word who was in the beginning (John 1:1-2, 14). The Word of God is the manifested Son of God. For this reason, Colossians 1:15-16 says that all things were created in and through the Son of God. Hence, the means of God&rsquo;s creation is the Son of God (Heb. 1:2) and also the word of God (11:3; John 1:1-3). Christ is the Son of God and the Word of God (vv. 1, 18; Rev. 19:13).</p><h2 class="head2">The Process of Creation</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; The heavens include heaven, celestial phenomena, and the angels living in heaven. The earth includes the creatures that live on the earth. According to Job 38:4-7, the morning stars and the angels existed before God created the earth. Hence, God created first the heavens and then the earth. When God created the earth, He measured it, stretching a measuring line over it; He made the earth in good order and exceedingly beautiful and delightful. When God created the earth, the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God&mdash;the angels (1:6; 2:1)&mdash;shouted for joy because the earth was beautiful.</p>
<p>The universe that God created had no shadow of sin or trace of chaos; it was altogether bright and beautiful. This shows the radiance and beauty of the Creator. Although the Bible provides very little description of the condition of the earth when it was created, Job 38:7 shows a glimpse of a joyful and harmonious scene: &ldquo;The morning stars sang together / And all the sons of God shouted for joy.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN&rsquo;S REBELLION</h2>
<p>The joyful and harmonious condition of God&rsquo;s original creation did not last. At a certain point, the greatest tragedy in the universe took place&mdash;Satan rebelled and was corrupted. Genesis 1:2 says, &ldquo;But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep.&rdquo; The earth that God created was neither waste nor emptiness, and darkness was not on the surface of the deep (Isa. 45:18); the earth became such later. The earth became waste and emptiness with darkness on the surface of the deep because Satan rebelled and was corrupted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Origin of Satan</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the Bible, after God created the heavens and the earth, Satan was appointed to rule the world (Luke 4:5-6; John 12:31; 14:30; Eph. 2:2). Satan was called the Daystar, son of the dawn (Isa. 14:12). He is one of the first angels (the sons of God&mdash;Job 38:7; cf. 1:6) created by God at the dawn of the universe, and he was the anointed cherub who covered the Ark (Ezek. 28:12-14). Satan was appointed by God to be an archangel; thus, there are angels under him (Rev. 12:7; Matt. 25:41). He must have been given a very high position because he was even higher than Michael the archangel (Jude 9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Satan&rsquo;s Rebellion</h2>
<p>Because of the pride in his heart, the God-appointed archangel exalted himself to be equal with God, rebelling against God and becoming God&rsquo;s adversary, Satan (Isa. 14:13-14; Zech. 3:1-2; Rev. 12:9; 20:2). Therefore, he was judged by God (Isa. 14:15; Ezek. 28:16-19).</p>
<p>Satan took the lead to rebel against and overthrow God&rsquo;s sovereignty. Some of the angels, who were set under Satan by God to help him rule the preadamic world, followed Satan to rebel. Hence, when God judged Satan, He also judged the angels under him (Rev. 12:4, 9). These rebellious angels became the rulers and the authorities of the air and the officers in Satan&rsquo;s kingdom to rule the world of this darkness together with him (Eph. 1:21; 2:2; 6:12; Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were creatures living in the preadamic world. When Satan rebelled, they followed him and rebelled. As a result, they too were judged by God and became demons (Mark 1:32, 34, 39; Luke 4:33), ministers of Satan running about the earth in order to fulfill Satan&rsquo;s evil will.</p>
<p>Because Satan, the fallen angels, and the creatures living in the preadamic world rebelled against God, the heavens and the earth, which they ruled and in which they dwelled, were defiled (Col. 1:20, footnote 5; Heb. 9:23, footnote 1). Hence, the heavens and the earth were also judged when God judged Satan, the fallen angels, and the creatures. The original situation of order, beauty, and light disappeared. Job 9:5-7 says that when God judged in anger, He commanded the sun not to rise, and He sealed up the stars. As a result, the sun and the stars did not shine, and the earth was enveloped in darkness and submerged under deep waters; the earth became waste and emptiness, with darkness on the surface of the deep (Gen. 1:2).</p>
<p>Jeremiah 4:23, Isaiah 34:11, and 2 Peter 3:6 reveal that the earth&rsquo;s becoming waste and emptiness with darkness on the surface of the deep was the result of God&rsquo;s judgment. This indicates that God judged the preadamic world by flooding it with water. God&rsquo;s original creation was destroyed by God&rsquo;s judgment.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">SEEING LIFE<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h1>
<p>After God&rsquo;s original creation became waste and emptiness because of His judgment, the whole universe fell under a curse. We do not know how long this situation lasted, but it must have been quite a long time. Then at a certain point God began His work of restoring creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REASON<br />
FOR GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>God restored His work of creation because He did not achieve His desire and good pleasure in the original creation. God&rsquo;s eternal plan and will were not accomplished, and there was a further need to deal with Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. Therefore, God had to restore the created world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 says, &ldquo;Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.&rdquo; Revelation 4:11 says, &ldquo;You have created all things, and because of Your will they were, and were created.&rdquo; Thus, we see that God&rsquo;s restoration of creation was based on His plan and will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>The means of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation was the Son of God and His word (Col. 1:15-16; Heb. 11:3; John 1:1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>Genesis 1 and 2 give a record of the process of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation. We need to consider this process carefully. When reading Genesis concerning the process of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, we must consider not only the facts of what God did on the first day, the second day, and so forth. Many things in the Bible, especially in the beginning book of Genesis and the concluding book of Revelation, do not contain much detail. Hence, we must see not only the facts but also what is implied by the facts. We must listen to the story of creation not as if we were merely children who want to learn some facts. We should instead seek God&rsquo;s light. Hence, we must see what is spiritually implied in this book of the Bible.</p>
<p>If we have God&rsquo;s light, we will see that life is the center and subject of the process of God&rsquo;s creation in Genesis 1. In this chapter God&rsquo;s attention is focused on things related to life. God created countless things in the universe, but He did not mention them. Instead, in this simple record of creation He provided details related to life and living creatures. This proves that in creation God&rsquo;s attention is on the matter of life.</p>
<p>If we look carefully into the process of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, we will see a line of life. According to fact, God created many kinds of life, beginning with the lower forms of life, before He created the human life. The spiritual implications of this line of life can be applied to our spiritual life. The steps of God&rsquo;s work preceding the creation of life speak of the conditions that are necessary for generating spiritual life, and the appearing of various kinds of life can be considered as the steps in the growth of our spiritual life. This understanding is not a random thought. I believe that these implications were present when the Holy Spirit inspired the writing of the Holy Scriptures. We will now consider step by step the process of creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Coming of the Spirit&mdash;<br />
the First Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:2 says, &ldquo;The earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.&rdquo; The first step in God&rsquo;s restoration of creation was the coming of the Spirit. Because of God&rsquo;s judgment, the earth was under deep waters and was covered by darkness. Both water and darkness in verse 2 symbolize death, indicating that the earth was in a situation of death; that is, it was lifeless.</p>
<p>The earth was covered by darkness when God accomplished the first step of His work&mdash;the coming of the Spirit. The Spirit of God is always the means by which God works. The Spirit of God came to eliminate death and to bring in life. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of life; in Him is life. Whenever a place needs life, it needs the Spirit of God. When the Spirit of God comes, He brings life. Therefore, the first step of God&rsquo;s work on the death-filled earth was for His Spirit to brood on the death waters.</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, the coming of the Spirit of God is the first requirement to generate the divine life. The creation of living creatures required the brooding of the Spirit of God, and the receiving of the life of God also requires the operation of the Holy Spirit. The life of God is with the Spirit of God. Before we were saved, we were filled with death and darkness; we were lifeless within. Hence, the Spirit reaching us was the first step that God took in generating His life in us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Coming of the Word and Light&mdash;<br />
the Second Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Verse 3 says, &ldquo;God said, Let there be light; and there was light.&rdquo; When the word of God comes, it brings in light. God&rsquo;s work always begins with light. God judges with darkness and restores with light. Darkness involves death in an old situation, but light generates a new situation. Water and darkness came in because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion. Therefore, God&rsquo;s restoration of creation involved the elimination of death and darkness by the Spirit and light.</p>
<p>The light in verse 3 signifies Christ as the light of the world (John 9:5; 8:12; 1:4-9; 12:46). The life of God enters into man through the shining of Christ. Wherever the light of Christ shines, there is life. Second Corinthians 4:6 says, &ldquo;The God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This means that the life of God shines into us through light. When the word of God comes, it brings light, and light brings life. Therefore, the coming of the word and of light is a requirement for generating life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Separating Light from Darkness&mdash;<br />
the Third Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:4-5 says, &ldquo;God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.&rdquo; Shining is the work of God, and the result of shining is separation. Nothing remains unseparated from darkness after being shined upon by God. Only that which is in darkness remains unseparated.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s work always separates light from darkness. God never allows that which is of Him to be joined to that which is of Satan. Second Corinthians 6:14-16 says, &ldquo;What partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? And what concord does Christ have with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an unbeliever? And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols?&rdquo; Light and darkness can never be joined; they must be separated.</p>
<p>The result of the separation of light from darkness is the establishment of day and night, the demarcation of which is related to light. God continued His work in the light in order to generate life. Therefore, the separation of light from darkness is also a requirement for generating life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Separating That Which Was Above<br />
from That Which Was Below&mdash;<br />
the Fourth Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:6-7 says, &ldquo;God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters. And God made the expanse and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse.&rdquo; God separated light from darkness on the first day, and He separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse on the second day. Deep waters were on the surface of the earth, which was full of death, but God created an expanse to separate the death waters.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God does not only bring light; He also separates that which is above from that which is below. When the Spirit of God comes, light shines to separate that which is above from that which is below, the heavenly from the earthly, the spiritual from the fleshly, and that which is of God from that which is of the devil. These separations give God the ground to continue His work of generating life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Separating the Waters from the Land&mdash;<br />
the Fifth Requirement for Generating Life</h2>
<p>Verses 9 and 10 say, &ldquo;God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas.&rdquo; On the third day God did not create dry land; rather, He restored the land that had been judged and was covered by deep waters. By this time light had been separated from darkness, and the waters were separated from the land. God&rsquo;s work always involves a series of separations.</p>
<p>God separated the waters from the land in order to generate life, because water symbolizes death, and the land is where life is generated. Plants and animals grow on land. Hence, the land symbolizes life. However, the separation of that which was above from that which was below was not enough; life still had to be separated from death. With the separation of the waters from the land, all the requirements for generating life were met.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Generating the Plant Life&mdash;<br />
the Generation of Life</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them upon the earth; and it was so.&rdquo; When the five requirements for generating life were met, God began to create life on the third day. After dry land appeared, life was generated.</p>
<p>Our receiving the life of God followed this principle. We were fallen men living in sin, darkened in our understanding, and blinded by the evil one. We were completely alienated from the life of God because of our ignorance and the hardness of our heart (Eph. 4:18), and we were utterly ignorant of spiritual things. The wrath of God was abiding upon us (John 3:36). This was also the condition of the judged and cursed earth.</p>
<p>But because of His mercy, God sent His Spirit to touch us, and the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ shined upon us and manifested our darkened condition to us (2 Cor. 4:4). Then we understood that our past deeds were shameful and would end in death. We also realized that light is versus darkness, that what is heavenly is versus what is earthly, and that life is versus death. As a result, we repented of our past, rejected darkness, and accepted the Lord Jesus as our Savior. Then the life of God entered into us to regenerate us, and we were saved. This shows that in order for the life of God to be generated in man, God must carry out several steps of His preparatory work. As soon as these requirements are met, the life of God is generated in man.</p>
<p>However, the life that is generated at this stage is like the immature plant life. The plant life is the lowest and most primitive form of life. Plant life does not have feeling or consciousness. This indicates that the condition of the life that we received when we were regenerated was immature; it was not yet solid, nor did it have a keen sense of feeling or consciousness. Hence, it is not sufficient for us to remain in this stage. We must grow.</p><h2 class="head2">The Light-bearers&mdash;<br />
the First Requirement for Life to Grow</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:14-15 says, &ldquo;God said, Let there be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; and let them be light-bearers in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth; and it was so.&rdquo; In the process of restoring creation, God&rsquo;s seventh step was to cause the light-bearers to appear in the expanse on the fourth day. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars.&rdquo; The word <em>made</em> here means &ldquo;produced&rdquo; in Hebrew; this is different from <em>created.</em> To create is to bring something into existence out of nothing, but to make is to take something that already exists and produce another thing out of it. On the fourth day God did not create the sun, the moon, or the stars out of nothing; He restored the existing light-bearers that had been judged (Job 9:7-8). On the first day light shined on the earth. This light had to be from the light-bearers. However, only light could be seen, not the light-bearers. On the fourth day God made the light-bearers appear.</p>
<p>Some may ask why God did not create the animal life immediately after He created the plant life on the third day; why did He instead restore the light-bearers? This is very significant. We must see that what God did on the fourth day is still for life, that is, for life to grow. We have said that life is closely related to the shining of light. In order for God to generate life, there is a prerequisite&mdash;the shining of light. Only with the light of the first day is it possible for there to be the generating of the plant life on the third day. When light shines, life comes. Wherever there is light, there is life. Life always follows light. However, the relationship between life and light does not stop with the third day. Not only is the generation of life based on light; the growth of life is also based on light. Just as the beginning of life requires light, the strengthening of life requires light as well. The strength of light determines the strength of life. This is an unalterable law.</p>
<p>The light that God caused to shine on the first day brought in the plant life, which is low and immature. God created only a low and immature life, because the light was not strong. The light of the first day was vague and indefinite, and therefore it could produce only a life that is low and immature, a life without feeling or consciousness. When God wanted life to grow, that is, to be expressed in a higher life, this vague light was not sufficient. Therefore, on the fourth day God made the light-bearers to appear. Then the light became definite, solid, and intensified. The sun, the moon, and the stars were set in the expanse of heaven in order to give light on the earth. Then God could create a higher form of life, the animal life.</p>
<p>The lights that bring forth life have a spiritual implication. We must apply this to ourselves and not take it as doctrine. We must ask ourselves concerning the condition of the light within us. The strength of the light of God within us indicates how much His life within us has grown. In order for our spiritual life to grow, we must receive a stronger shining. Only a stronger shining can cause more growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ruling&mdash;<br />
the Second Requirement for Life to Grow</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:16-18 says, &ldquo;God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness, and God saw that it was good.&rdquo; After the sun, the moon, and the stars were restored, God arranged for them to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness. This shows that with the appearing of definite light-bearers, there was a ruling over the day and over the night. Furthermore, the separation of the light from the darkness was strengthened. With the shining of the first-day light, there was a separation of light from darkness and of the day from night. But this separation was indefinite, because the light was not strong. The light of the fourth day, however, was strong; therefore, the separation of the light from the darkness was more definite.</p>
<p>The strengthening of the separation is also a requirement for life to grow. When the shining that we receive intensifies, we are able to clearly differentiate what is of God from what is not of God. The more separation we experience, the more we will be delivered from the earthly to the heavenly and from the fleshly to the spiritual. As a result, the life within us will grow further.</p><h2 class="head2">Generating the Animals in the Water&mdash;<br />
the First Step in the Growth of Life</h2>
<p>Verses 20 and 21 say, &ldquo;God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living animals, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of heaven. And God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.&rdquo; Since there were light-bearers, God began to create animal life on the fifth day. This signifies that when the shining that we receive within is intensified and when the separation in our walk is more evident, the life of God in us will grow to a higher level.</p>
<p>The animal life is a higher life, possessing feeling and consciousness. The animal life can be divided into a few levels. The first level involves the animals in the water, such as fish. Although fish are the lowest form of animal life, their life is much higher than the plant life. The fish life is higher than the plant life because fish have more consciousness and feeling than plants and because fish can live in water. Trees and vegetables can grow on land, but fish can swim around and live in water. Therefore, the animal life in water is higher than the plant life.</p>
<p>This also applies to the growth of our spiritual life. The more life grows, the richer and stronger our feelings and consciousness becomes. Those who know the Bible know that the land symbolizes life and that water symbolizes death. When our spiritual life is young, we can grow only in an environment of life. We are unable to stand when we encounter an environment of death, because our spiritual life is not strong enough to withstand the pressure of the authority of death. However, as our spiritual life grows, our inner strength increases so that we are able to move around in an environment that is full of the power of death.</p>
<p>For example, even though many brothers and sisters have a heart to serve God, new believers are young and tender in their desire to serve; hence, they cannot bear any difficulties. If they are admired and encouraged, they serve energetically and are willing to give everything to the Lord. However, if they suffer difficulties, they immediately lose heart and can even stop coming to the meetings. Experienced brothers and sisters, however, serve whether they are praised, suffer difficulties, or are misunderstood. They are not affected by their environment but are able to stand firm.</p>
<p>These differences between young believers and experienced believers can be seen in the bread-breaking meeting. When the atmosphere of the bread-breaking meeting is fresh, lively, and full of the Spirit&rsquo;s operation, the young praise loudly; but when the atmosphere of the meeting is a little down, they are silent and do not know what to say. The experienced brothers and sisters, however, can still exercise their spirit in a deadened and down meeting, breaking through the pressing atmosphere and enlivening others from within.</p>
<p>These examples show that those who are young in the divine life grow only in an environment of life, but those who are experienced in life can move about in an environment of death. Such experienced brothers and sisters have the higher &ldquo;fish&rdquo; life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Generating the Animals in the Air&mdash;<br />
the Second Step in the Growth of Life</h2>
<p>On the fifth day God also created the second level of animal life, the bird life. This level of life is higher than the fish life, because it can transcend the encumbrances of the earth and is not limited by the earth; rather, it lives in a heavenly realm. Even in terms of consciousness, the bird life is higher than the fish life.</p>
<p>The steps of our spiritual growth in life develop in the same way. Our initial life is young, vague, and indefinite; it lacks consciousness and feeling and can live only in an environment of life. As the light of God&rsquo;s life becomes more solid and intensified in us, our spiritual life is uplifted and grows. It can be likened to the fish life that can grow even in an environment of death.</p>
<p>As our spiritual life continues to grow, we will manifest a transcendent condition that can be likened to the bird life. This means that although we are living on the earth, we are not of the earth and are not usurped by the things of the earth. Instead, we seek the things that are above. At this time, we have more growth in life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Generating the Animals of the Earth&mdash;<br />
the Third Step in the Growth of Life</h2>
<p>Verses 24 and 25 say, &ldquo;God said, Let the earth bring forth living animals according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind; and it was so. And God made the animals of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.&rdquo; On the sixth day God created the third level of animal life, the animals of the earth. The animals of the earth have a higher level of life because they have a higher level of consciousness. This level of life also symbolizes further growth in our spiritual life, a growth that enables us to move on the earth, to serve God, and to work for God.</p>
<p>When our spiritual life grows to this level, we can truly work by life for God. Even though believers can and should serve God as soon as they are saved, their initial serving derives mainly from their abilities and methods. Believers who grow to the extent of being transcendent often only live an individual transcendent spiritual life. They are not able to work for God or to labor and serve others in harsh environments. It is easy for them to touch the Lord, to feel free, and to be at ease in personal prayer, but it is difficult for them to maintain this transcendent condition when things are busy outwardly. Such believers can only be Marys, not Marthas (Luke 10:38-40; John 12:2-3). In other words, they have only the bird life, not the life of the animals of the earth. Believers who have the life of the animals of the earth have both a personal spiritual life and a spiritual work before God. They can outwardly be as busy as Martha but inwardly be as quiet as Mary at the Lord&rsquo;s feet. Whether they are still or drawn about, alone or busy serving with others, they can live by life before God. Such believers have an even higher growth in life.</p><h2 class="head2">The Council of the Godhead&mdash;<br />
Determining to Create the Maturity of Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&rdquo; After God created all the living animals, He created man. Among all created life, man has the highest consciousness and the highest level of life. In God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, His ultimate desire is to gain man. Therefore, God&rsquo;s creation of man differs from His creation of other creatures; it began with a council of the Godhead. &ldquo;God said, Let Us...&rdquo;; this is the first time in the Bible that God called Himself &ldquo;Us.&rdquo; This shows that God is triune. The Triune God had a council of the Godhead concerning the creation of man. In this council God determined to create the highest level of life&mdash;man&mdash;in His image and according to His likeness.</p>
<p>According to spiritual significance, this signifies the life of God maturing in us. In the process of creation the life of man is likened to the life of God. The end of our growth in life is our becoming like God. This matter is initiated by God and determined by God; He will conform us to the image of His Son and glorify us (Rom. 8:29-30). God has determined this and will carry it out in us. Therefore, the maturity of life is God&rsquo;s will, is of God, and is initiated by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Creating Man&mdash;the Maturity of Life</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:27 and 28 say, &ldquo;God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.&rdquo; This is the final step of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>Verse 26 mentions the council of God concerning the creation of man. Verses 27 and 28 mention the carrying out of God&rsquo;s creation of man. The man that God created had the highest level of created life on the earth, possessing God&rsquo;s image to have dominion for Him. Then God&rsquo;s creation was complete. This signifies the maturity of life. When God&rsquo;s life matures within us, we are able to express God&rsquo;s image and have dominion for God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOCUS OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION OF CREATION</h2>
<p>From the process of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, we can see that God&rsquo;s restoration of creation is focused on three things. The first focus of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation is to gain the earth. The Spirit and light came and did many works of separation in order to remove the traces of judgment and the curse and to cause the harmony and beauty of creation to reappear on the earth. When the earth was restored, God gained a place on which life could grow and where He could reign. Therefore, the earth is a focus of God&rsquo;s attention in His creation.</p>
<p>The second focus of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation is to gain man. From the record of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation, we see that God&rsquo;s creation is for gaining man. Every step of God&rsquo;s creation was a preparatory work for God to create man. When man was created, God&rsquo;s work was finished, and He rested (vv. 26, 31; 2:1-3). The goal of God&rsquo;s creation is to gain man, because only man can express God&rsquo;s image, rule and have dominion on the earth, and deal with God&rsquo;s enemy (1:26, 28). Thus, only man can achieve God&rsquo;s purpose and give God rest. The focus of God&rsquo;s creation is to gain man so that God&rsquo;s purpose may be achieved. </p>
<p>The third focus of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation is to have life. In Genesis God repeatedly paid attention to life. God created countless things, but He did not mention them; He mentioned only the things related to life and the living creatures. This shows that God&rsquo;s creation is focused on life.</p>
<p>Every form of life that God mentioned has implications for our spiritual life because God knows that only His life can achieve His purpose. However, only by His life growing in man unto maturity can man express God and exercise dominion for Him. This is the reason that God paid particular attention to life in His work of creation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PURPOSE OF GOD&rsquo;S RESTORATION<br />
OF CREATION</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw the reason, the basis, the means, the process, and the focus of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation. Now we will consider the purpose of God&rsquo;s restoration of creation. This is a great point. If we read the first two chapters of Genesis and pay attention only to what God created each day, we are merely on the surface. We must see the intrinsic spiritual significance of creation and identify God&rsquo;s desire and purpose in creating the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING<br />
THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>What was God&rsquo;s intention and purpose in creating the heavens, the earth, and all things? In addressing this question we should consider the creation of man on the sixth day. Genesis 1:26 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; This shows that the most important thing in God&rsquo;s creation of man is that God created man in His image and according to His likeness. If we are enlightened by the Holy Spirit, it is not difficult to see God&rsquo;s desire and purpose in creating all things. God wanted to gain a group of people with His image and likeness, that is, a group of people who are exactly the same as He is.</p>
<p>The account of God&rsquo;s creation contains a clear picture: God created the heavens and the earth and all things in them, and He created man with His image and likeness according to Himself. This picture reveals that man is the center of all things in the universe because only man has the image and likeness of God. Of all the things created in the universe, man is the highest and most central creature. The record of creation reveals that God&rsquo;s first and foremost desire and purpose in creation are to gain a group of people who are like Him, possessing His image to express Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Expressing God</h2>
<p>Why does God have a desire that man would be exactly the same as He is? The Bible reveals that God longs to gain a group of people who are exactly the same as He is in order to express Him and to declare Him so that His glory may be fully manifested. It pleases God to gain such a group of people as His image in the universe so that through them all things may see Him and know Him (Gen. 1:26; Rom. 8:29-30).</p>
<p>Many prominent public figures hang portraits of themselves in many places. These portraits are their expression. Although these public figures may not often be seen in person, they are expressed among people through their portraits. When people see their portraits, they are able to know these figures.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a friend in the United States whom we have never seen in person and who wants to visit us. If he wants us to know what he looks like before he arrives, he can take a picture of himself and send it to us. We can know him through his picture because he is exactly the same as the image in the picture.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Made in the Image of God</h2>
<p>Man bears the image of God; he is a picture of God. God intended to come into the midst of all things, but before He came, He took a &ldquo;picture&rdquo; of Himself and put it in front of all things, manifesting Himself before all things. This picture is man, Adam. Later, when God came to the earth and was manifested among men, His name was Jesus Christ. If we were to place Adam and Christ together and compare them, we would see that they bear the same image.</p>
<p>Man is a picture of God. This is not a careless statement. Genesis 1:26-27 says that man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to His likeness. <em>Likeness</em> refers to the outward form; <em>image</em> refers to the inward parts, such as the mind, the emotion, and the will. When man was created, he had the image of God inwardly and the likeness of God outwardly. Created man bears the image of God; hence, man is a picture of God.</p>
<p>Some people have the wrong concept that God did not have the likeness of a man until He was incarnated. However, even in the Old Testament age, before Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, God appeared to people in the likeness of a man. In Genesis 18 Abraham received three guests, of whom two were angels and one was God (vv. 2, 10, 13-14, 22; 19:1). God appeared in the likeness of a man. Therefore, God had this likeness first, not man. Man was created according to God&rsquo;s likeness. Hence, when God was incarnated (John 1:14), the likeness that He put on was His likeness. Let us consider the earlier example. The picture that our friend in the United States takes of himself before his visit is according to his likeness. The picture was taken of him; hence, he possessed his likeness first, and then the picture possessed his likeness. Similarly, before Christ came to the earth, He already possessed His image and likeness. God created Adam according to the image and likeness of Christ. Hence, God&rsquo;s image and likeness were possessed first by Christ and then by Adam. When Christ came into the world, it seemed as if God put on the likeness of man; however, the likeness of man was originally God&rsquo;s likeness.</p>
<p>The utterance in Genesis 1:26-27 is very particular. Verse 26 says, &ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness.&rdquo; There is only one God, but the pronoun here is <em>Us</em> instead of <em>Me,</em> showing that God is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The image that the Triune God wanted to create in man is identified also with the pronoun <em>Our.</em> Verse 27 speaks of God&rsquo;s creation: &ldquo;God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.&rdquo; In this verse, however, a singular pronoun is used in the phrase <em>His own image.</em> What is the significance of this pronoun? In the Trinity only the Son, Christ, has an image. Second Corinthians 4:4 says that Christ is &ldquo;the image of God.&rdquo; Colossians 1:15 says that the beloved Son of God is &ldquo;the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ is &ldquo;the impress of His substance.&rdquo; John 1:18 says that &ldquo;no one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; These verses reveal that Christ the Son of God is the image of God. Apart from Christ we cannot see God. Hence, when God created man in His own image, He created man according to Christ. This created man was Adam. For this reason, Romans 5:14 says that Adam is &ldquo;a type of Him [Christ] who was to come.&rdquo; This means that before Christ came to the earth, there was already a picture of Himself according to His likeness on the earth. This picture was Adam. Therefore, it is not that Christ is like Adam but that Adam is like Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">Needing to Receive the Life of God</h2>
<p>Adam possessed the image and likeness of God outwardly; however, he did not have the life and nature of God inwardly. Therefore, after God created Adam, He put him before the tree of life with the intention that Adam would receive the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9), which signifies the life of God. If Adam had received the tree of life, he would have had not only the likeness of God outwardly but also the life and nature of God inwardly and thus be completely like God.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Adam fell before he received the life signified by the tree of life. As a result, he could not receive God in order to express God inwardly and outwardly. It was not until Christ came to the earth to die for man&rsquo;s redemption that the life of God was again made available to man. When Christ died and resurrected from the dead, He released the divine life for man to receive. When we believe into Christ and receive Him, His life enters into us. Furthermore, from that time onward the life of God continues to work in us until it makes us exactly the same as He is. For this reason, Romans 8:29 says, &ldquo;Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; As believers, we were foreknown and predestinated by God; hence, His life will work in us until we are conformed to the image of His Son to become exactly the same as He is.</p>
<p>We need to understand that as created men, we had only the image of Christ outwardly, not the life and nature of Christ inwardly. When we were saved, Christ&rsquo;s life and nature entered into us. From that time, God has been working to conform us through His Spirit and our outward environment to the image of Christ; He will continue to work until we are the same as His Son in life and in nature, that is, until we are the same as He is and become His expression. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we &ldquo;are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This continual work of the Spirit of God to transform us into the image of the Lord also refers to the conforming work of God.</p>
<p>Romans 8:29 and 2 Corinthians 3:18 stress our inward change. Philippians 3:21 says, &ldquo;[He] will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.&rdquo; This means that in the future our body will be transfigured so that our outward physical form will also enter into glory. At that time, when &ldquo;He is manifested, we will be like Him&rdquo; (1 John 3:2).</p>
<p>Our possessing the image of God is revealed in Revelation as well. On the one hand, God is sitting on the throne and has the appearance of jasper (4:2-3); on the other hand, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of the redeemed ones, also has the appearance of jasper (21:11). God and the New Jerusalem are jasper; they are exactly the same. Just as God is, so are His redeemed ones. At this point God will have made His redeemed ones exactly the same as He is.</p>
<p>The verses above show that the line of image runs through the entire Bible. The line reveals that God desires to gain man so that man would have His image for His expression. This is God&rsquo;s desire and purpose in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ruling for God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire and purpose in His creation of man is that man would express Him and that man would have authority to rule for Him and thus deal with His enemy. Genesis 1:26-28 says, &ldquo;God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth. And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.&rdquo; This portion concerns the image of God and the dominion of God. Dominion is a matter of authority. God created man in His image and gave man authority to rule over all living creatures. God&rsquo;s image in man was created by God, but God&rsquo;s authority in man was given by God. Image speaks of man&rsquo;s being, but authority speaks of man&rsquo;s doing. On the one hand, man is in the image of God; on the other hand, man rules for God. Hence, the image refers to man&rsquo;s status, and ruling refers to man&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Every person has a status and a work. For example, if a person has the status of a student, his work is to study. If a person has the status of a teacher, his work is to teach. If a person has the status of a businessman, his work is to conduct business. The status of a student refers to his person, and studying refers to his work. The status of a teacher refers to his person, and teaching refers to his work. The status of a businessman refers to his person, and conducting business refers to his work. Every person has a work. Created man is no different. Man&rsquo;s person is in the image of God, and his work is to rule for God. God gave created man the high status of His image and the great work of ruling for Him. Regrettably, man&rsquo;s person and work today are not up to the standard. Our person is not right, and our work is not right. In His salvation, however, God desires to save us to the extent that we have His image and that we rule for Him.</p><h2 class="head3">Ruling for God to Deal with His Enemy</h2>
<p>God desires that man would rule for Him and exercise dominion for Him. According to Genesis 1:26, God wants man to &ldquo;have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&rdquo; To have dominion over the fish of the sea is to have dominion over the sea, to have dominion over the birds of the air is to have dominion over the air, and to have dominion over the cattle and every creeping thing is to have dominion over the earth. Therefore, God wants man to have dominion over everything in the sea, in the air, and on the earth. God has given dominion to man in these three realms.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, there are four key places in the universe: the heavens, the sea, the air, and the earth. God has committed the sea, the air, and the earth to man for his dominion. Why did God do this? What was His intention? The Bible reveals that in the universe today only the heavens are still God&rsquo;s dwelling place, where He rules. The enemy, Satan, has usurped the sea, the air, and the earth. Hence, God wants man to have dominion over these three places so that man would rule over these three places for God in order to deal with His enemy.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the sea is the dwelling place of the demons. In Matthew 8:28-32 the demons who were cast out of two people went into a herd of hogs. The whole herd rushed down a steep slope into the sea and died in the waters. Demons are different from the evil spirits in the air. The evil spirits take the air as their dwelling place, but the demons take the sea as their dwelling place.</p>
<p>Today people are still possessed by demons. It is not uncommon to hear stories of people possessed by demons. No matter how much science advances or how much people promote the putting aside of superstitions, we must solemnly acknowledge that there is not only God but also demons in this universe. The progress of science cannot overthrow this fact, and putting aside superstitions cannot annul the existence of demons. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He often encountered demon-possessed people and had to cast out the demons (4:24; 8:16; Mark 1:34). Many of us who work for the Lord have also encountered incidents of demon possession. Around one hundred years ago the Lord sent Dr. John L. Nevius of the Presbyterian Church in America to Shantung for the gospel. His book, entitled <em>Demon Possession and Allied Themes,</em> is an authoritative writing on demon possession. The stories of demon possession in this book are not hypothetical; they are a record of the author&rsquo;s casting out demons in village after village when he was preaching the gospel in Shantung. Demons exist, and their dwelling place is the sea.</p>
<p>In the Bible the sea is not a positive place, because it is the dwelling place of demons. During the six days of God&rsquo;s restoration work, He saw that it was &ldquo;good&rdquo; every day except for the second day (Gen. 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25), because on the second day God separated the waters from the waters, producing the air and the sea (vv. 6-8). Satan and his fallen angels are in the air, and the demons are in the sea. Hence, on the second day God did not see that it was good.</p>
<p>Many other portions in the Bible reveal that the sea is not a good place. For example, when God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, the first problem that they encountered was the sea (Exo. 14). Furthermore, in the Gospels the Lord Jesus was crossing the sea to cast out demons when He encountered the hindering of the winds and the sea. It was not the winds or the sea that were hindering the Lord; it was the fallen angels and demons behind the winds and the sea. Hence, the Lord Jesus rebuked the winds and the sea. If the winds and the sea were merely in the physical realm, there would have been no need to rebuke them. The Lord was rebuking the fallen angels and demons behind the scene (Matt. 8:23-27). Revelation also reveals that the forces opposing God come out of the sea (13:1-10). The purpose of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is to clear up the sea. This work will not be completed until the coming of the new heaven and the new earth. Then the sea will cease to exist because it will have been eliminated by God (21:1).</p>
<p>Ephesians speaks of the authority of the air and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies (2:2; 6:12), both of which refer to the angels who followed Satan in his rebellion. These rebelling angels dwell in the air and are the authority of the air, and Satan is the ruler of the authority of the air. Thus, Satan occupies the air.</p>
<p>The air is the dwelling place of Satan and his evil spirits, and the sea is the dwelling place of the demons, but the earth is the place where they operate. The earth is the center of their activities. Satan, the evil spirits, and the demons work to usurp the earth, because their goal is to occupy the earth. For this reason, God wants man not only to rule over the air and the sea but also to have dominion over the earth. The earth is the center of these three realms.</p>
<p>God committed the sea, the air, and the earth to man&rsquo;s dominion so that man would rule for Him in these three realms and deal with His enemy. This is revealed in the particular utterance in Genesis 1:26: &ldquo;Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.&rdquo; Logically, it would be sufficient to say &ldquo;Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle of the earth,&rdquo; but God added another phrase: <em>and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.</em> The earth and the creeping things are emphatically pointed out. God gave man dominion over three realms, but He particularly pointed out the earth. Moreover, there are numerous kinds of animals on the earth, but God emphatically mentioned the creeping things. This indicates that of the three places over which God gave man dominion, God focused on the earth, and among the animals on the earth God focused on the creeping things. In Luke 10:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions.&rdquo; Serpents and scorpions are creeping things on the earth. God is concerned about the earth and the creeping things on the earth because Satan and his messengers are hidden in the creeping things on the earth.</p>
<p>From the above verses we can understand that God&rsquo;s curse on the serpent, &ldquo;Upon your stomach you will go&rdquo; (Gen. 3:14), was to limit the serpent&rsquo;s activities to the earth. The activities of God&rsquo;s enemy and his fallen messengers take place on the earth. They are creeping things; they cannot operate outside of the earth. Hence, when God commissioned man to rule for Him, He focused on the earth and the creeping things so that man would deal with His enemies on the earth.</p>
<p>God charged man to deal with His enemies so that man would rule for Him. When God created man, His desire was not only that man would express His image but also that man would rule for Him in order to deal with His enemy. In this twofold purpose, the aspect of expressing God&rsquo;s image is positive and primary, but the aspect of dealing with the enemy is negative and supplementary. Expressing God is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, but dealing with His enemy is a supplementary purpose that was added because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s unique eternal desire is for the universe to be a realm with all things as the content and a group of people as the center. God created man in a particular way so that man would ultimately be the same as He is in image, life, and nature in order to become God&rsquo;s expression. In this desire God did not have the thought of dealing with an enemy.</p>
<p>According to His desire, God made an eternal plan, based upon which He created the universe. This is the original creation recorded in Genesis 1:1. The main creatures in this creation were angels. The highest angel was the archangel Lucifer, who was anointed to cover the Ark (Ezek. 28:13-14). However, this archangel exalted himself and rebelled against God. Furthermore, some of the angels under him joined in his rebellion. Even some living creatures on the earth, over which he was given dominion, also joined in his rebellion.</p>
<p>After this archangel rebelled against God, he became God&rsquo;s adversary in the universe. In Hebrew <em>Satan</em> means &ldquo;adversary.&rdquo; Everything that Satan does is against God in order to offend God, frustrate God&rsquo;s will, and even violate God&rsquo;s authority and overthrow God&rsquo;s lordship (Isa. 14:12-14). He does nothing else. Because of this rebellion, he became Satan, the angels who followed him became the evil spirits, and the living creatures on the earth under his dominion became the demons.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s rebellion resulted in two systems of lordship in the universe: God&rsquo;s lordship and Satan&rsquo;s lordship of rebellion. After Satan rebelled against God, the heavens remained the place where God dwells and rules, but the air became the dwelling place of Satan and the evil spirits, the sea became the dwelling place of the demons, and the earth became the realm of their activities. Hence, God&rsquo;s authority in the air, in the sea, and on the earth is undermined, and His will cannot be carried out freely.</p>
<p>Because God&rsquo;s lordship was violated, dealing with His enemy was added to God&rsquo;s plan. God&rsquo;s desire to be expressed was from eternity, but the desire to deal with His enemy was added.</p>
<p>When Satan and his messengers rebelled against God, they corrupted the entire original creation. As a result, the earth became waste and emptiness, darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the earth was full of desolation and death (Gen. 1:2). This desolate situation lasted for an unknown period of time before God carried out His restoration and further creation in six days. During this time God created man. The center of His work is the creation of man. God has a twofold purpose in creating man. On the positive side, He wants to be expressed; on the negative side, He wants to deal with His enemy. The positive aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose is eternal, but the negative aspect did not come until Satan rebelled. The positive aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose is a matter of image, but the negative aspect is a matter of lordship, dominion. Therefore, Genesis 1:26-27 speaks of image first, saying that God created man in His image and then speaks of man having dominion over everything in the sea, in the air, and upon the earth. The main purpose of man&rsquo;s having dominion is to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy.</p><h2 class="head3">Ruling for God in Order to Recover the Earth</h2>
<p>God gave man authority so that man might rule for Him in order to recover the earth. Because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, the earth was usurped by Satan; hence, God&rsquo;s desire is to recover and regain the earth. Therefore, verses 26 and 28 speak of God&rsquo;s giving authority to man so that man would have dominion over the earth. If man reigns over the earth, God can recover the earth under His authority through man.</p>
<p>Man always feels that the heavens are good. But according to the Bible, God feels that the earth is good. If man could choose between the heavens and the earth, he would prefer to live in the heavens. God, however, prefers the earth. God desires and yearns for the earth. In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord taught the disciples to pray to the Father who is in the heavens, &ldquo;Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (6:9-10). Proverbs 8:31 says, &ldquo;Rejoicing in His habitable earth; / And my delight was in the sons of men.&rdquo; This means that when the Lord created the world, He rejoiced in His habitable earth and delighted to dwell among the sons of men. Psalm 8:1 says, &ldquo;O Jehovah our Lord, / How excellent is Your name / In all the earth.&rdquo; The last verse of this psalm says, &ldquo;How excellent is Your name / In all the earth!&rdquo; (v. 9). The thought in this psalm is the same as the thought in Genesis 1 that is focused not on the heavens but on the earth.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that God wants to return to the earth in order to gain the earth. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is also to recover the earth so that He may return to the earth. God desires His authority to reach earth. For this reason, the Lord taught the disciples to pray to the Father who is in the heavens, saying, &ldquo;Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth&rdquo; (Matt. 6:9-10). When Satan rebelled, the earth was occupied by him and became the sphere of his rule; consequently, the will of God cannot be done on earth as in heaven. Therefore, the Lord told us to pray in this way and ask God to work so that His authority can be carried out on the earth. When God&rsquo;s authority is carried out on earth, the kingdom of God is on the earth. A kingdom is a realm for ruling, and the extent of a kingdom is the extent of its authority. Today the kingdom of God does not yet encompass the whole earth. As a result, the authority of God is not yet exercised over the whole earth, and the will of God cannot be done on the earth. Throughout the ages God has been seeking to resolve this problem.</p>
<p>When the Lord comes again and the millennial kingdom begins, the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15). In eternity the dwelling place of God will descend onto the new earth. Hence, in Revelation 21:1-2 the apostle John says, &ldquo;I saw a new heaven and a new earth...And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; At this time the earth will be taken back from Satan and fully recovered by God.</p>
<p>When the earth is recovered by God, His authority will be carried out on the earth. Furthermore, His kingdom, His will, and His glory&mdash;the three major things that the Lord prayed about in Matthew 6&mdash;will be accomplished (vv. 10, 13). The kingdom of God will be on the earth, the will of God will be done on earth as it is in heaven, and the glory of God will be manifested on the earth. This was God&rsquo;s original intention when He gave man authority to rule for Him. If man had not failed but had remained in God&rsquo;s hand to rule for Him, God&rsquo;s enemy would have been dealt with, the earth would have been recovered by God, and the authority of God would have been carried out on the earth. God&rsquo;s twofold purpose would have been fulfilled in man in the beginning.</p>
<p>We should worship and praise God, because His twofold purpose will be accomplished in man. His purpose in the beginning is still the same today. The Bible reveals that after man was created, the struggle between Satan and God was centered on man. God wants to gain man to fulfill His purpose, but Satan also wants to gain man to carry out his evil intent. Regardless of when or where, as long as God gains man, He has a way to fulfill His purpose to be expressed and to exercise His authority. However, if man is gained by Satan, Satan has a way to carry out his evil intent to destroy God&rsquo;s plan, frustrate God&rsquo;s expression, and hinder the authority of God. Hence, man is the central figure in the universe; man is the focus of the struggle between God and Satan. God has given man such a high and noble status. May God have mercy on us so that we may see this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Having Rest</h2>
<p>God desires man to have His image to express Him, and He desires man to have His authority to deal with His enemy. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages has been focused on fulfilling these two aspects of His desire. God is working to fulfill His desire, He created us for His desire, and He saved us for His desire. When these two aspects of His desire are accomplished, that is, when man has the image of God to express Him and the authority of God to deal with His enemy, God will have rest.</p><h2 class="head3">Having Rest in God&rsquo;s Creation</h2>
<p>Rest means satisfaction. God&rsquo;s desire to be expressed and to deal with His enemy depends on man. When man has the image of God, he can express God, and when man has the authority of God, he can rule for God and deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. When this twofold desire is fulfilled in man, God is satisfied; that is, He has rest. Therefore, another aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man is to have rest by being satisfied through man.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:3 says, &ldquo;God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.&rdquo; This verse marks the completion of the account of creation in the Bible, because symbolically God attained His purpose and was satisfied. God gained a creature who had His image to express Him and His authority to rule for Him. When God saw the man whom He had created, He was satisfied and had rest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Sabbath Rest</h2>
<p>The rest in God&rsquo;s creation was only partially fulfilled in terms of reality, because God&rsquo;s eternal desire and purpose were not completely fulfilled, and even to this day they are still not fulfilled. Because of man&rsquo;s fall, God has been working continuously to fulfill His purpose. Hence, when the Lord healed the man who had been in sickness for thirty-eight years on the Sabbath, He said, &ldquo;My Father is working until now, and I also am working&rdquo; (John 5:17). All God&rsquo;s work today is for the accomplishment of His purpose so that He may have rest. God&rsquo;s satisfaction and rest are a great matter. From eternity God has been longing for rest.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God ordained the Sabbath for His people to remember His rest in creation. The Sabbath was also for His people to testify that He desires to have rest among His people on the earth. Exodus 20:8-11 says, &ldquo;Remember the Sabbath day so as to sanctify it. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Jehovah your God; you shall not do any work, you nor your son nor your daughter, your male servant nor your female servant, nor your cattle nor the sojourner with you, who is within your gates. For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore Jehovah blessed the Sabbath day and sanctified it.&rdquo; God commanded the children of Israel to keep the Sabbath by not working on it, in order to testify that God rested on the Sabbath and that man should obey God&rsquo;s authority and live by His will. The Sabbath is a type that shows how God values rest and how man can give God rest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Rest in the New Testament Age</h2>
<p>Why is there the Lord&rsquo;s Day in the New Testament age? The Lord&rsquo;s Day is also a type of rest. It signifies that through death and resurrection the Lord entered into glory as the full expression of God and as the Ruler ascended to the heavens to be far above all God&rsquo;s enemies. Furthermore, the significance of the Lord&rsquo;s Day also shows that those who are joined to the Lord in His name are where He is. Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s Day indicates not only that God&rsquo;s twofold purpose was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus and that God rested in Him; the Lord&rsquo;s Day indicates also that God&rsquo;s twofold purpose is fulfilled in His believers and that God rests in them. Therefore, while we are breaking the bread to remember the Lord on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we should release the Lord&rsquo;s life and express Him. We should also be overcomers who exercise the Lord&rsquo;s authority to deal with His enemy. Only in this way can we realize the meaning of the rest on the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>Based on the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, the Holy Spirit entered into us. As a result, we can have a foretaste of the rest in reality. We should be in this foretaste not only on the Lord&rsquo;s Day but also on the other days of the week. As long as we allow the life of God to flow out from us so that God can be expressed through us and also allow the authority of God to be carried out through us so that God&rsquo;s enemy can be dealt with, we can fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and give God satisfaction and rest.</p>
<p>Individual believers can fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and give Him rest, and the church corporately can fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and give Him rest. Ephesians speaks of this. On the one hand, the church is the Body of Christ, &ldquo;the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo; (1:23), and the individual believers need to &ldquo;be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo; (3:19). On the other hand, the church needs to &ldquo;put on the whole armor of God&rdquo; to fight against the enemy and stand against the stratagems of the devil (6:11-13). The former verses speak of the church being filled with God and expressing God; the latter verses speak of the church dealing with Satan. God can have rest in such a church, and the church can have a foretaste of all the blessings in His rest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Resting in the Millennial Kingdom</h2>
<p>In a very real sense, the rest that God has today is only partial; it is a miniature and a symbol of the rest that God had on the seventh day of creation. It is not until the coming of the millennial kingdom that God will gain in reality a group of people who are exactly the same as the Lord (1 John 3:2) to express the glory of God (Col. 3:4; 1 Thes. 2:12), to reign with the Lord (Rev. 20:6), and to put His enemy, Satan, into the abyss (vv. 1-3). Then there will be a great rest, which is the completion of God&rsquo;s rest. This is the rest in the millennial kingdom prophesied in Psalm 95:6-11 and referred to in Hebrews 4:3-11.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Resting in the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2>
<p>The rest in the millennial kingdom will still not be full or complete. God&rsquo;s work in the universe will not be consummated until there are the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem. Only then will God be fully expressed and His authority fully established. Then God&rsquo;s desire and purpose will be fully accomplished, and God will gain eternal rest.</p>
<p>Revelation 21 through 22 shows the two aspects of God&rsquo;s purpose in the New Jerusalem. On the one hand, the New Jerusalem has the image of God. The entire city is like God. God is jasper, and the New Jerusalem is also jasper (4:3; 21:11). The New Jerusalem refers to God&rsquo;s redeemed throughout the ages (vv. 12, 14). In the new heaven and the new earth, all God&rsquo;s redeemed people will receive His dispensing to be exactly the same as God, expressing Him. Those who read Revelation know that the entire city of the New Jerusalem is an expression of God. The city radiates God&rsquo;s glory and splendor (21:11). God is expressed and shined forth through the city. God finally gains a full expression of Himself in the new universe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, God&rsquo;s redeemed ones not only express the glory of God but also reign for eternity (22:5). By the time of the new heaven and the new earth, Satan will be cast into the lake of fire (20:10), and God&rsquo;s redeemed will reign as kings. To reign as kings is to shame the enemy. Therefore, when God&rsquo;s purpose is fully accomplished in eternity, there will still be the two aspects of the image of God and the authority of God. The image of God is attained by the redeemed ones expressing God, and the authority of God is manifested by the redeemed ones shaming God&rsquo;s enemy. Then God will have full and complete rest.</p>
<p>This rest is from God&rsquo;s side. God needs to satisfy His heart&rsquo;s desire so that He may have rest. However, this rest is not only for God but also for man. God needs rest, and man needs rest. If God can rest in man, man can also have rest because of God&rsquo;s rest. Therefore, man must allow God to fulfill His purpose before he can have rest. Regardless of whether the rest is in God&rsquo;s creation, in the Old Testament Sabbath, in the Lord&rsquo;s Day in the New Testament, in the millennial kingdom, or in the new heaven and the new earth, man can enjoy rest together with God because he has allowed God to fulfill His purpose.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:4-25</h1>
<p>Beginning with this chapter we will consider the procedure that God takes to fulfill His purpose. Although Genesis 2:4-25 is a short portion of the Bible, it is rich in spiritual implications. We need much time to point out the important implications one by one. All Bible readers encounter a problem when reading this portion. They do not understand why the Bible repeats the story of the creation of man beginning in verse 4. The common explanation is that the creation of man in Genesis 1:26-28 is a general outline but that 2:4-25 is a detailed and supplementary description of the creation of man. This understanding may seem logical, but if we look to the Lord, we will realize that these verses have a greater significance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING THE PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 reveals that God&rsquo;s desire and purpose are related to image and authority. He wants man to express Him, and He wants man to deal with His enemy. When both aspects of God&rsquo;s desire are fulfilled, He will be satisfied and have rest. The procedure that God takes to fulfill His desire and purpose is life, because chapter 2 speaks of a tree with a very particular name&mdash;the tree of life. After God created man, He placed man in front of the tree of life (vv. 8-9). This means that God wanted man to receive His life, signified by the tree of life, to thereby fulfill His desire and purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Conforming Man to the Image of God<br />
So That Man May Express God</h2>
<p>God created Adam in chapter 1, but at that time Adam had only the image of God, not the life of God (v. 26). Hence, Adam had no way to express God. A picture may represent a person, but it conveys only his appearance; it does not contain his life. A statue may express an image, but it is merely an outward appearance; it does not convey his inward character, because it does not have his life. Similarly, Adam had the image of God outwardly, but he did not have God&rsquo;s life inwardly. Adam had only the created human life; he did not have the uncreated life of God. Hence, Adam could express God only in appearance and likeness; he could not express God in nature and character. In order for God to fulfill His purpose in man, He needs to work His life into man. When God&rsquo;s life enters into man, man can be like God in both appearance and in nature. He can have not only God&rsquo;s outward appearance but also God&rsquo;s inward content, which is God&rsquo;s life. Only the divine life can conform us to the image of God&rsquo;s Son so that we are like Him (Rom. 8:2, 6, 29). Only the divine life can bring us into the glory of God so that we express Him (v. 30; Col. 3:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Life Giving Man Authority<br />
So That He May Rule for God</h2>
<p>Without the life of God, man cannot rule for God. Ruling is based on the life of God. In Numbers 17 Aaron&rsquo;s rod budded, blossomed, and bore ripe almonds. This indicates that man must have the life of God in order to rule for God. A rod represents authority, and a budding rod is a matter of resurrection. The leader of each of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel put a rod in the Tent of Meeting, but only Aaron&rsquo;s rod budded (vv. 1-8). This means that only Aaron had the life that had passed through death and resurrection. This resurrection life made Aaron acceptable before God and gave Aaron authority among the children of Israel.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:6 says that the resurrected believers are able to reign with the Lord. These believers are full of the resurrection and overcoming life inwardly; hence, they can rule for God outwardly. Chapter 22 reveals that life is related to ruling. The throne of God and of the Lamb is in the New Jerusalem, and the river of water of life proceeds out from this throne. A throne signifies ruling; therefore, life and ruling are inseparable (v. 1).</p>
<p>Man needs the life of God inwardly in order to express God and to rule for God to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. Therefore, in God&rsquo;s further creation in Genesis 1 and 2, life was His goal. He created all kinds of life forms, and He also created man with the highest created life. However, this was not enough: God still wanted man to receive His uncreated life, which is signified by the tree of life in the garden of Eden (vv. 8-9).</p>
<p>The garden of Eden is a very meaningful picture. In the garden there was a tree of life, and next to the tree stood a man made of dust. In the garden there was also a river that divided into four branches. The flowing of this river issued in gold, bdellium, and precious stones (vv. 8-12). Bible readers know that gold always signifies God&rsquo;s nature (Exo. 25:11) and that dust signifies the human nature (Gen. 2:7; 1 Cor. 15:47). Although created man is the same as God in his outward appearance, his inward content and nature are of dust instead of gold; hence, his being is different from God&rsquo;s. The picture in Genesis 2 shows that the divine life, as signified by the tree of life, must enter into man to become the flow of life within him in order for a man of dust to become gold. The result of the flowing of life is that the man of dust becomes gold.</p>
<p>The picture at the end of Revelation is similar to the picture in Genesis 2. However, the New Jerusalem is a city of gold, not a man of dust (Rev. 21:18). In the New Jerusalem man will have the appearance of God. God will be his content, and he will have the nature of God. Man will be the same as God in life and in nature, and man will be able to express the glory of God and to rule for God. Then God&rsquo;s purpose in man will be fully accomplished. Therefore, life is the procedure that God takes to fulfill His purpose. In order to fulfill His purpose, God must dispense His life into man. If His life does not enter into man, man cannot be like God in order to express Him, nor can man rule for God in order to deal with His enemy. God&rsquo;s purpose cannot be fulfilled by human effort. The fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose requires God&rsquo;s life to enter into man.</p>
<p>This is the truth of the Bible. This truth is different from the teachings of the Chinese sages. The sages taught man to improve his behavior, to activate his own goodness, and to develop his &ldquo;bright virtue,&rdquo; that is, to magnify his human virtues. However, according to the truth of the Bible, man does not have the ability to improve himself, to activate his own goodness, or to cultivate himself in order to be like God. The human nature is dust, whereas the nature of God is gold. It is impossible to change dust into gold apart from the divine life. We thank the Lord that His saving way is to dispense His life and nature of gold into man in order to transform man. This is the way that we can receive the nature of God to express His image and to rule for God to deal with His enemy, Satan.</p>
<p>We need to consider step by step the procedure that God takes to fulfill His purpose according to the account in Genesis 2. Verses 4 through 25 speak of this procedure. These verses can be divided into three sections. The first section is from verse 4 through verse 7, the second section is from verse 8 through verse 17, and the third section is from verse 18 through verse 25. These three sections speak of the three steps of the procedure that God takes to fulfill His purpose.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FIRST STEP OF GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE&mdash;<br />
CREATING MAN AS A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Background</h2>
<p>The first step that God took in fulfilling His purpose was to create man. Genesis 2:4-7 says, &ldquo;These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. When Jehovah God made earth and heaven, and no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up&mdash;for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground, but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground&mdash;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; Why does this portion begin by saying that nothing had sprung up from the earth because Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth? Why does it say that there was no man to work the ground but that a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground? Why are these things mentioned before God&rsquo;s creation of man? This portion provides the background of God&rsquo;s creation of man.</p>
<p>We need to maintain a principle when reading Genesis 2. This chapter can be compared to a detailed painting. Therefore, we should not consider merely the literal meaning of the words in this chapter; rather, we should ponder the implied meaning in order to understand this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head3">There Being No Rain upon the Earth</h2>
<p>Verse 5 says that before God created man &ldquo;no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up.&rdquo; However, according to chapter 1, the plant life, such as grass and herbs, were already growing (vv. 11-12). Why does chapter 2 say, &ldquo;No herb of the field had yet sprung up&rdquo;? We must understand the implied meaning in this portion. The spiritual implication of this portion is that before man was created, the life of God could not grow out of the earth. In order for the life of God to grow out of the earth, the creation of man was needed. Hence, God created man so that His life could grow out of the earth.</p>
<p>Verse 5 also says, &ldquo;Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth.&rdquo; <em>Rain</em> here also has an implied meaning. Joel 2:23 says that Jehovah gives the children of Israel the early rain and makes rain to come down for them. Then verse 28 says that God will pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. These verses show that rain in the Bible signifies the Spirit poured out from God. The Spirit of God descends from heaven just as rain descends from heaven. The rain that descends from heaven to earth has two issues. On the one hand, it mingles with the dust of the earth; on the other hand, life grows out of this mingling. Both issues have a spiritual meaning.</p>
<p>Before man was created, rain did not come down from heaven. This means that before there was a man on the earth, the Spirit of God did not come to mingle with anything on the earth. Before man was created, there was nothing on the earth with which the rain from heaven could be mingled. This situation changed after God created man, because there was a living creature on the earth, the man formed of dust, with whom the Spirit of God, the rain descending from heaven, could be mingled. From that point on, the life of God could grow out from such a mingling.</p>
<h2 class="head3">There Being No Man to Work the Ground</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:5 also says, &ldquo;There was no man to work the ground.&rdquo; This means that not only had the Spirit of God not yet descended but also that there was no man to cooperate and work together with God in order for the life of God to grow out of the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Mist Going Up from the Earth</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;A mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.&rdquo; This means that before God created man, nothing on the earth was mingled with something that descended from heaven. Everything on the earth was out of the earth. These three points&mdash;no rain upon the earth, no man working the ground, and a mist going up from the earth&mdash;are the background of God&rsquo;s creation of man.</p>
<p>With this background God created man. After man was created, God was afforded an opportunity to send something from heaven to mingle with the things on the earth. Therefore, verse 7 subsequently says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.&rdquo; The breath of life can be considered as the first drop of rain that descended from heaven to the earth in order to mingle with the dust of the earth and produce life. This life was like God and was in His image. According to the spiritual implication, we may say that at this point the life of God began to grow out of the earth. We must try our best to understand these matters.</p><h2 class="head2">The Creation of Man</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:7 speaks of how God created man: &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; This verse shows that there were three steps in God&rsquo;s creation of man.</p>
<p>The first step is that God formed man from the dust of the ground. This was to create man&rsquo;s outward body. Today chemists confirm that the elements in a human body are found in the earth. The human body has salt, sulfur, phosphorus, iron, and copper, all of which are found in the earth. Hence, 1 Corinthians 15:47 speaks of Adam, the first man, who is &ldquo;out of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If man has only a body made from the dust of the ground, then man is of no value; he is no different from a sheep or a dog. However, in creating man God did something very unique, something that He did not do when He created other living things. In addition to forming man&rsquo;s body out of the dust of the earth, God breathed the breath of life into man&rsquo;s body. This is marvelous! God did not do this when He created the plants, nor did He do this when He created the animals. God did not breathe the breath of life into any living creatures apart from man. Bible readers agree that although the breath of life was not God&rsquo;s life or His Spirit, it produced life when it entered into man; this life is related to the spirit in man.</p>
<p>Man is different from all the animals because only man has a spirit. The spirit of man makes man higher than all the animals. The human spirit is the breath that God breathed into man. Although it was not God&rsquo;s life or His Spirit, the breath of life that God breathed into man is something out of God. Therefore, the Bible says that man is of God&rsquo;s race (Acts 17:28) and that Adam is &ldquo;the son of God&rdquo; (Luke 3:38).</p>
<p>When God breathed the breath of life into man, He had a wonderful intention: He created man as a vessel to express Him. He made an organ within man that enables man to love God, be drawn to God, and also contact and receive God. Everything in God&rsquo;s creation of man is meaningful. For example, because man needs to eat in order to live, God created man with a stomach, giving man the requirement, the desire, and the ability to eat. Likewise, God breathed the breath of life into man and created a spirit in man so that man would have a spiritual &ldquo;stomach.&rdquo; The Bible reveals that God is our food, our living water, and our bread of life (John 6:27, 35; 4:14; 1 Cor. 10:3-4). If we did not have a human spirit as our spiritual stomach, we would not desire God or eat Him as the bread of life. The psalmists said that they panted for God as the hart pants after the streams of water (Psa. 42:1). Dogs and cats do not desire God, because they do not have a spiritual stomach.</p>
<p>Some who think that they are clever might say, &ldquo;We are in the twentieth century. There is no need to believe in God.&rdquo; However, we have to believe in God. To avoid believing in God is the same as to avoid eating food. We need to eat because we have a stomach for eating physical food, and we need to believe because we have a spirit for receiving God. When man was created, God breathed the breath of life into man. When this breath of life entered into man, it became his human spirit. The human spirit has its preferences, desires, and requirements. The human spirit prefers, desires, and requires God. It is no wonder that regardless of whether people are civilized or barbarian, cultured or uncultured, they have the concept of worshipping God. To worship God is not a matter of being uncivilized or of being civilized; it is a matter of need. Whether people are uncivilized or civilized, they need to eat. In fact, the more civilized people are, the more they desire to eat. Hence, the more civilized people are, the more they need God.</p>
<p>Many prominent figures throughout human history said when they were young that there is no God; however, they began to seek God when they became successful and famous and had entered into their latter years. Despite the fact that they had great accomplishments and enjoyed their life, their spiritual stomach was empty. They eventually looked for something to believe in because they were looking for something to fill their spiritual stomach. The need for God was placed within man when he was created. Hence, man desires God and needs God. Moreover, man is also able to contact God because man has a special organ&mdash;the human spirit&mdash;within him.</p>
<p>For example, we cannot use a teacup to contact electricity or receive electricity. However, a light bulb with a tungsten filament, even if it is very small, can contact and receive electricity. Every human being has a &ldquo;tungsten filament&rdquo; that is able to receive electricity. As long as we contact God as the &ldquo;electricity,&rdquo; He will flow through us. We willingly and happily believe in God, because if we did not believe in God, we would be in agony inwardly. When we believe in God, we are at rest. Those who claim that they do not believe in God think that they have their eyes open, but they are actually in agony. We who believe in God are at rest, because we allow God to flow through us like electricity flows through a light bulb. The human spirit is an organ within man that was formed by the breath of life that God breathed into man. God created a human spirit in man so that man might contact and receive Him.</p>
<p>When God breathed into man, the man of dust became alive with a personality, an ego. This personality is man&rsquo;s soul. The sequence of God&rsquo;s creation of man is first man&rsquo;s body, then man&rsquo;s spirit, and lastly man&rsquo;s soul. Man is composed of three parts: a body, a soul, and a spirit. These three parts constitute a person. At this point, God&rsquo;s creation of man was complete.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<p>Even though Genesis 1 ends with God&rsquo;s creation of man, man did not have God as his content. He was only a vessel to contain God, just as an empty soda bottle is a vessel to contain soda. God created man in Genesis 1:27. This was the preparation of the vessel. Adam was like a &ldquo;bottle&rdquo; to contain God. Therefore, after God created man, there was the need for a further step in order for man to receive His life. This is revealed in 2:8-17.</p>
<p>After creating Adam, God put him in front of the tree of life. This can be compared to making a soda bottle and then putting it before a soda dispenser in order to be filled. If we could ask God why He put Adam in front of the tree of life, He might ask in return, &ldquo;Is it not evident that I put Adam there in order to put My life into him?&rdquo; Nevertheless, there is a still a distinction between man and a soda bottle. Soda must be poured into a soda bottle, because the soda bottle is passive. God, however, did not force His life into Adam. God wanted Adam to take the initiative to receive His life because Adam was a living person with a God-given free will.</p>
<p>Verses 8 through 14 say, &ldquo;Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there He put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And a river went forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four branches. The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Cush. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one that goes east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.&rdquo; After God created Adam, He put Adam in the garden of Eden in the east. In the Bible the east refers to a bright place of glory (Ezek. 43:2). In Hebrew the word <em>Eden</em> means &ldquo;pleasure.&rdquo; A garden refers to a beautiful and gratifying place. The garden of Eden must have been a bright, glorious, beautiful, gratifying, and pleasant place. This is where God put the man whom He created.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God&rsquo;s Thought in the Garden<br />
Being Related to a Tree and a River</h2>
<p>Even though all kinds of created things were in the garden, Genesis 2:8-14 focuses on two things&mdash;a tree and a river. The Bible is special. It shows that God&rsquo;s thought in the garden was related to a tree and a river.</p>
<p>God focused on the tree of life because it was related to life. The tree of life speaks of the matter of food. Food is related to being healthy; it is related to life. Hence, when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven...given for the life of the world&rdquo; (John 6:51). When the Bible speaks of the tree of life, it is in reference to food, and food is a matter of life. This is the thought in the Bible. It is crucial for us to see this thought in the Bible.</p>
<p>The record of God&rsquo;s creation in the first two chapters of Genesis is particular. God created myriads of things, but in the record of God&rsquo;s creation only a few things are mentioned, because God&rsquo;s central thought is related to life. God wants us to see that His desire in creation is to work His life into man so that man would have His image and dominion. This is the central thought of God. Hence, in the record of creation God reveals things that are related to His desire and that express His desire. We must not regard creation as something ordinary; rather, we must see the line of life in it.</p>
<p>Likewise, when reading Genesis 2 concerning the garden of Eden, we must understand that God&rsquo;s central thought is focused on life. After God created man, He put man in the garden of Eden so that man would receive His life. Hence, even though there were myriads of things in the garden, God does not mention them. When He spoke of the garden, He spoke of the tree of life, which was related to food. He said that the tree of life was in the middle of the garden (vv. 8-9). We should pay special attention to these three words: <em>tree, food,</em> and <em>life.</em> The tree of life was a matter of food, and food is necessary for life. This means that life was in the middle of the garden. Therefore, the first matter that man encountered after he was created was how to contact this life. This life is God Himself.</p>
<p>The tree of life was not the only tree in the garden of Eden. In addition to the tree of life, there was also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When man touches the tree of life, he receives life, but when he touches the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he receives death. Man receives life or death depending on which tree he contacts. The tree of life is crucial in the Bible. Both man and the tree of life are at the beginning of the Bible and at the conclusion of the Bible. Whether man lives or dies depends on how he relates to these two trees.</p><h2 class="head3">The Thought of the Tree in the Bible</h2>
<p>In Exodus 15 the children of Israel came to Marah in the wilderness, where they could not drink the water, because it was bitter. God showed Moses a tree, and when Moses cast the tree into the waters, they became sweet (vv. 22-25). Song of Songs compares God to an apple tree (2:3). In Ezekiel 47 the flowing of the river of life issues in trees growing on the banks of the river; the fruit of the trees is for food, and their leaves are for healing (v. 12). When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He said that He is the true vine (John 15:1). Furthermore, the Bible often speaks of the cross as a tree (Acts 5:30; 10:39). First Peter 2:24 says that the Lord Jesus &ldquo;Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree.&rdquo; At the end of the Bible, in the New Jerusalem, there is the tree of life. Therefore, the tree is an important matter in the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:8-9 says that &ldquo;every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food&rdquo; was in the garden of Eden. <em>Pleasant to the sight</em> indicates that the trees were to please man; <em>good for food</em> indicates that the trees were to satisfy man. Even though there were many trees in the garden of Eden, the tree of life was in the center. If we are enlightened concerning this portion, we will realize that the tree of life is the center of the universe. As far as God&rsquo;s purpose in the universe is concerned, the earth is the center of the universe, the garden of Eden is the center of the earth, and the tree of life is the center of the garden of Eden. Of all the items in the universe, God&rsquo;s focus is on the tree of life.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to the tree of life, for only it can supply the uncreated life of God. When God put man in front of the tree of life, He wanted man to eat of the tree in order to fulfill His purpose. When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, He was the tree of life. He came to please and to satisfy man and also to give man God&rsquo;s life. Whether man lives or dies is determined by his receiving or rejecting the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Thought of the River in the Bible</h2>
<p>Verse 9 in Genesis 2 speaks of the tree of life, and verse 10 speaks of a river. The thought of a river is also a major item in the Bible. When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, a rock was cleft, and living water flowed out to quench their thirst (Exo. 17:6). Psalm 46:4 says, &ldquo;There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God.&rdquo; The living water and the river in these verses symbolize the life supply flowing out of God. In John 4 the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). In John 7 He also said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). At the end of Revelation a river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (22:1). This river issues in the life supply for man.</p>
<p>The tree is a matter of food, and it gives man life. The river is a matter of drink, and it also gives man life. Both the tree and the river, food and drink, issue in God&rsquo;s life. On the one hand, the life of God is our food, and on the other hand, the life of God is our drink. On the one hand, the life of God satisfies our hunger, and on the other hand, it quenches our thirst. When the life of God satisfies our hunger or quenches our thirst, it gives us life.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:10 says, &ldquo;A river went forth from Eden to water the garden.&rdquo; The river is for watering. Verses 5 and 6 say that &ldquo;Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground, but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.&rdquo; This means that before God created man, there was no rain from heaven to water and mingle with the dust of the ground. There being no rain upon the earth to water the dust of the ground until after man was created is symbolic. The dust of the ground signifies man, and the rain from heaven signifies God&rsquo;s life. After man was created, life came down from heaven, and God could enter into man to water man, quench man&rsquo;s thirst, and flow God&rsquo;s life into man.</p>
<p><em>Eden</em> signifies God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the place where He dwells (Ezek. 28:13). The river that flowed out of Eden is a symbol of the river that flows out of God. Hence, this river signifies life flowing out of God. The garden was also man&rsquo;s dwelling place. Therefore, Genesis 2:10 reveals that the Spirit of life, the living water of life, flows out of God into man in order to water man and mingle with man.</p>
<p>The second half of Genesis 2:10 says, &ldquo;From there it divided and became four branches.&rdquo; The river signifies the one creating God, but this river divided and became four branches. While the number one signifies the creating God, the number four represents the four directions of north, south, east, and west and signifies created man. Therefore, this portion shows the living water of life flowing out of the one God into man in order to meet man&rsquo;s every need.</p>
<p>The names of the four branches of the river, the places they flowed through, and what they produced also bear a spiritual significance. The name of the first branch is Pishon (v. 11). In Hebrew <em>Pishon</em> means &ldquo;flowing free&rdquo; and implies &ldquo;freely given.&rdquo; This means that the living water of life is given freely. Anyone who thirsts can come to the waters and receive without money and without price (Isa. 55:1). He who wills can take the water of life freely (Rev. 22:17). This branch flowed around the whole land of Havilah (Gen. 2:11). <em>Havilah</em> means &ldquo;to cause to grow,&rdquo; showing that there is life wherever the water of life flows. Life can even grow in a place that cannot sustain life (Ezek. 47:9, 12). The flow of this river issued in gold (Gen. 2:11). In the Bible gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. This means that the flow of the water of life issues in man receiving God&rsquo;s nature, that is, partaking of God&rsquo;s divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Genesis 2:12 says that bdellium and onyx stone were in this branch of the river. Bdellium is a pearl-like material produced by the resin of a tree. It typifies the produce of God the Son in His redeeming and life-releasing death and in His life-imparting resurrection. This is an issue of the flow of the water of life. Onyx is a precious stone that signifies the manifestation of God&rsquo;s glorious image (Rev. 4:3). The flow of the water of life causes man to have God&rsquo;s glorious image. Second Corinthians 3:18 confirms that we are &ldquo;being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence, the one river in the garden of Eden describes the issue of the river of water of life flowing through man. God&rsquo;s life is given to man freely and flows into man to regenerate those who are dead so that they have God&rsquo;s life and nature to manifest His glorious image.</p>
<p>The name of the second branch is Gihon (Gen. 2:13). In Hebrew <em>Gihon</em> means &ldquo;waters bursting forth&rdquo; and implies &ldquo;overflowing.&rdquo; This speaks of the water of life overflowing and bursting forth from within man. The Lord Jesus said that the water He would give man would become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life (John 4:14). The Lord Jesus also said that rivers of living water would flow out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him (7:38). The river Gihon also &ldquo;goes around the whole land of Cush&rdquo; (Gen. 2:13). <em>Cush</em> means &ldquo;black face&rdquo; and symbolizes the unchangeable, evil nature of sinners (Jer. 13:23). This indicates that when the water of life flows into sinners, it produces God&rsquo;s glorious image in sinners (Eph. 4:22-24; Col. 3:9-10; Phil. 3:21).</p>
<p>The name of the third branch is Hiddekel (Gen. 2:14). <em>Hiddekel</em> means &ldquo;rapid,&rdquo; implying power. This means that the water of life is powerful in man. Philippians 3:10 says that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection has power. Ephesians 1:19-20 says that the surpassing greatness of God&rsquo;s power operates in His believers. This river &ldquo;goes east of Asshur&rdquo; (Gen. 2:14). Darby&rsquo;s New Translation says that this river &ldquo;flows forward toward Asshur.&rdquo; <em>Asshur</em> means &ldquo;plain,&rdquo; a place where people dwell. The Lord came so that man may have life (John 10:10). He gives living water to those who thirst (7:37). This living water flows from God to the place where man dwells.</p>
<p>The fourth branch is the Euphrates (Gen. 2:14), or Perath in Hebrew. <em>Perath</em> means &ldquo;fragrant, sweet, making fertile, fruitful.&rdquo; This means that the water of life can make man&rsquo;s life sweet, fertile, and fruitful. Paul says that the apostles manifested the savor of the knowledge of Christ (2 Cor. 2:14). This savor, or sweetness, was the flowing out of the water of life. In addition, the water of life flows all the fullness of the Godhead in Christ into us to make us full in Him (Col. 2:9-10). Second Peter 1:3-4 says that God has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness so that through these we might become partakers of His divine nature. Then Peter enumerates the fruit born of this life in verses 5 through 7. The fruit of the Spirit listed in Galatians 5:22-23 is also the issue of the flow of life.</p>
<p>The issue of the four branches of the living water of life is rich. All the fullness of the Godhead flows in this river in order to reach us. God put Adam in the garden of Eden with the tree of life and a river. The tree of life is a matter of food, and the river is a matter of drink. Both the tree and the river are matters of life. This reveals that God&rsquo;s desire and purpose for man are fulfilled through life.</p><h2 class="head3">From the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The condition of the garden of Eden is similar to the condition of the New Jerusalem. The garden of Eden is a garden; the New Jerusalem is a city. Although a garden is different from a city, the content of the garden of Eden is similar to the content of the New Jerusalem. For example, the tree of life is in the garden of Eden, and the tree of life is also in the New Jerusalem. The water of life is in the garden of Eden, and the water of life is also in the New Jerusalem. The flow of the river in the garden issues in gold, bdellium, and precious stones. Gold, pearls, and precious stones are also in the New Jerusalem. The picture at the beginning of the Bible is seen at the conclusion of the Bible. This picture is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>If we are enlightened by God, we will realize that the garden of Eden in Genesis is the same as the New Jerusalem in Revelation. The only difference is that the garden of Eden is a miniature symbol, and the New Jerusalem is a full manifestation. When everything in the garden of Eden is fully manifested, we have the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>If we know the Bible, we will understand that the garden of Eden is a very important place. The garden of Eden is the garden of God; it is a place where God is pleased and finds delight, a place where He can be satisfied. God&rsquo;s desire and purpose depend on man receiving His life. For this reason, God put man in the garden of Eden and also put the tree of life in the garden of Eden. Hence, the garden of Eden contains what is needed to accomplish God&rsquo;s desire and purpose.</p>
<p>When God put man in the garden of Eden, He wanted this man of dust to receive the tree of life, which signifies the life of God. No adjective can describe this life, because the life of God is unique. In the universe only the life of God can be considered as life, because the life of God is eternal and divine. Only the life of God possesses the nature of being eternal and divine. No other life is eternal or divine in nature, and no other life can attain to the standard of being eternal and divine. This is the unique life in the Bible.</p>
<p>Psalm 36:9 says that with God is the fountain of life. John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo;; that is, in Christ, the embodiment of God, was life. The embodiment of God said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly&rdquo; (10:10), and &ldquo;I am...the life&rdquo; (11:25). First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; <em>Life</em> in these verses refers to the unique life of God. Therefore, God put man in front of the tree of life to show that He wanted man to receive His unique life.</p>
<p>In addition to the tree of life, in the garden of Eden there was a river. If we stood in front of the tree of life and watched the flowing river that issued in gold, bdellium, and precious stones, we would probably admire what we saw. Because we know that we are of dust, we might say, &ldquo;How can I, a man of dust, become gold, bdellium, and precious stone?&rdquo; Perhaps God would answer, &ldquo;Do you want to become gold, bdellium, and precious stone? Only the water of life can produce these precious materials. You must receive this life. When this life enters into you, it will flow within you as living water and will &lsquo;flow&rsquo; you, a man of dust, into gold.&rdquo; This is the revelation in this portion of the Bible.</p>
<p>The divine, eternal, and uncreated life of God is at the center of the universe, and we, as men of dust, are standing before this divine life. God&rsquo;s desire is that we would receive His life. On the one hand, this life is the fruit of life, and on the other hand, it is the living water of life. We can eat this life, and we can also drink it. When the water of life enters into us, it flows. It is wonderful that after flowing within us, it &ldquo;flows&rdquo; us, who are men of dust, into gold. This is spoken of in 2 Corinthians 4:7, which says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels.&rdquo; Earthen vessels are vessels of dust; our bodies were formed from the dust of the earth. The treasure is the life of God and is typified by gold, pearls, and precious stones. This treasure refers to God&rsquo;s element. When the life of God enters into us, it transforms our human life and nature until we become the same as God in life and nature, that is, until we become gold, pearls, and precious stones.</p>
<p>At the end of Revelation the men of dust become a city. In this city there is nothing other than gold, pearls, and precious stones. In the garden of Eden there was the Adam of dust, but in the New Jerusalem there is no man of dust. The men of dust have become a city of precious stones. There was no wall in the garden of Eden; there was only a keeper, a man of dust. Thus, &ldquo;foxes&rdquo; could enter at will. In the New Jerusalem, however, the keeper has become the wall. The Adam of dust has become a city of jasper. Everything in the New Jerusalem is precious stone; there is no longer anything of dust. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages has been to transform men of dust into gold, pearls, and precious stones. In the New Jerusalem God&rsquo;s desire and purpose will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>We praise God because His doings are excellent and wonderful. He created man with a human spirit as a receiving organ so that man might receive His life (Gen. 2:7; cf. Job 32:8). On the one hand, His life is food, and on the other hand, His life is living water. When we receive the water of life, we are transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones by its flow. Even though man is the highest creature, he must receive the life of God in order to become a treasure. A person is noble, precious, and valuable when he has the life of God in him. If he lets the life of God flow through him, he becomes precious. When the life of God enters into us, it brings the element of God into us. Because God is exceedingly noble, precious, and indescribable, the gold, pearls, and precious stones signify God&rsquo;s noble and precious element. In order for men of dust to have the noble and precious element of God, we must let the life of God flow in us. This life transforms us to be as noble and precious as God is until we express God&rsquo;s glory and deal with His enemy. Then God&rsquo;s desire and purpose will be fulfilled, and God will be satisfied and at rest.</p>
<p>After man was created, he was put in front of life. This life is God Himself coming to be man&rsquo;s food and drink so that man may gain Him. Furthermore, this life will flow through man so that man may gain the element of gold, pearls, and precious stones. This is the meaning of the picture in Genesis 2.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:15 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.&rdquo; <em>To work</em> and <em>to keep</em> indicate man&rsquo;s responsibility. Verses 16 and 17 say, &ldquo;And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; This was a warning. The result of eating of the tree of life is life, but the result of eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is death. To eat is to receive; therefore, the result of receiving life is life, but the result of receiving the knowledge of good and evil is death.</p>
<p>The first step that God took in order to fulfill His purpose was to create man with a human spirit. The human spirit is an organ for man to contact and receive God. God created man with a spirit because He wants man to receive Him. Dogs, cattle, and sheep do not have a spirit; therefore, they cannot receive God. Man, however, has a spirit. Therefore, we can receive God, and we need God. Our spirit is a special organ created by God. The second step in the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s desire and purpose involves man receiving God&rsquo;s life. Man is a vessel to contain the life of God. Therefore, after creating man, God put this vessel in front of His life so that man might receive Him as life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STEP OF GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE (CONTINUED)</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Wanting Man to Choose Freely&mdash;<br />
Giving Man a Free Will</h2>
<p>In order for man to receive His life, God put man in front of the tree of life, but He wanted man to choose freely. God put man in the garden of Eden in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:8-9). This indicates that God gave man a free will. A soda bottle cannot choose, because it does not have preferences, inclinations, or thoughts. However, the man that God created for Himself is living and has a will, preferences, inclinations, and thoughts. God wants to put His life into man, but He cannot disregard man&rsquo;s consent and force-feed man like a mother who forces a child to receive medicine. If God forced His life into man, man would consider God to be barbaric, uncivilized, and unpleasant. Instead, God is noble; He does not like to force man. He gave man the freedom to choose. If man has a regard for God, man can choose God. Otherwise, God will let man be.</p>
<p>The matter of free will is a great subject in Christian theology. God has a will, Satan has a will, and man has a will. Therefore, there are three wills in the universe, each of which is free. No one can force God, and no one can force Satan. In the same way, man has a free will. God does not force man; only the evil one, Satan, forces man to do things. Those who are upright do not force others; only evil men force others. Sometimes, evil men, such as bandits and robbers, will also tempt, deceive, seduce, and ensnare. In order to gain man, Satan either forces or ensnares man. However, our God is too great and too noble. He respects man and never forces or ensnares man. God presents man with what He wants to do so that man may choose; then He accepts man&rsquo;s choice. After God created man, He put man in front of the tree of life because He wanted man to be free to choose.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Tree of Life versus<br />
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>
<p>Given the freedom to choose, man was presented with two opportunities. One opportunity was the tree of life, which signifies God Himself. To choose the tree of life is to choose God, to contact the tree of life is to contact God, and to receive the tree of life is to receive God. Man also had an opportunity to choose the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which signifies Satan.</p>
<p>The tree of life signifies God, because the Bible repeatedly says that God is life (John 1:4; 11:25; 1 John 5:20). But how can we say that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan? The tree of life involves only life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, however, is more complicated because it involves knowledge, good, and evil. Knowledge, good, and evil include everything that man contacts in the universe that is apart from God. Hence, in the universe man can contact either God or knowledge, good, and evil. Thus, knowledge, good, and evil refer to everything other than God, and Satan is the center and totality of these three items. If we are contacting something other than God Himself, it belongs to either knowledge, good, or evil. Everything that man contacts or encounters on the earth encompasses either God or knowledge, good, and evil. The things related to mankind are good if they are somewhat noble, evil if they are somewhat base, and knowledge if they involve wisdom. Man&rsquo;s life on earth involves worshipping, contacting, and gaining either God or knowledge, good, and evil.</p>
<p>To contact life is to contact God, because the ultimate destination of life is God. Similarly, to contact knowledge, good, or evil is to contact Satan, for Satan is the manipulator behind knowledge, good, and evil. The issue of contacting life is that man receives life, but the issue of contacting knowledge, good, and evil is that man receives death. The ultimate issue of everything outside of God, whether it is good or bad, is death. People think that good is different from evil. But the Bible reveals that both evil and good are not life and are outside of life. Furthermore, people, especially those in the twentieth century, regard knowledge as if it were indispensable. The twentieth century can be called the century of knowledge, the age of knowledge. However, we must remember that the issue of knowledge is death, the issue of good is death, and the issue of evil is death. These three items seem different in nature, but they lead to the same destination and result in death.</p><h2 class="head3">Everything outside of God Being Death</h2>
<p>May we be enlightened to see that as long as something is outside of God, whether it is knowledge, good, or evil, it is not God; rather, it is death. Some people may think that only evil is death and that only evildoers belong to death. They do not consider doing good to be death, nor do they consider studying knowledge or developing the mind to also be death. The Bible reveals that only God is life; everything outside of God, whether it is knowledge, good, or evil, is death. Knowledge, good, and evil do not represent Satan directly; they represent everything outside of God, the ultimate destination of which is Satan.</p>
<p>Everything outside of God is related to Satan. One day the Lord said that He must go to Jerusalem and be killed. Peter, who loved the Lord, took the Lord aside and rebuked Him, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; But the Lord immediately rebuked Peter, saying, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; (Matt. 16:21-23). Even Peter, who loved the Lord, was called Satan. I hope that we would see the light revealed here. The tree of life is God, because only God is life. Everything outside of God is death, Satan. Our hatred is Satan, and our love may also be Satan. Whether our love is Satan depends on whether our love comes from God, because only God is not Satan. People think that to do evil is satanic, but to do good is angelic. This, however, is not the case. A good deed that is not in God is of Satan.</p>
<p>God has enlightened us to see these two trees. Moreover, these two trees represent everything in the universe. One tree represents God, and the other tree represents everything outside of God. Only God is life. Anything outside of God, whatever it may be, is death; it is Satan. Even the words of the Bible can bring man into death if the Spirit is not in them. Only God is life, because only God is Spirit (John 4:24). Only the Spirit can cause man to gain God in order to enliven man (2 Cor. 3:6). Everything outside of God is related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the totality of which is Satan and the ultimate end of which is death.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Embodiment of Satan</h2>
<p>From Genesis 3 to the end of Revelation, the Bible mainly speaks of Satan indirectly through his deeds and hidden activities in persons, matters, and things. Even in Genesis 3 the name Satan is not mentioned; rather, there is mention of a serpent, which is Satan. If someone says that Satan is in Genesis 3, he is being too rigid. We must take a more indirect way and say that there is a serpent in Genesis 3, that Satan was hidden in this serpent, and that the serpent was the embodiment of Satan. Satan was in the serpent; therefore, the serpent was Satan.</p>
<p>Isaiah 14:12-15 says, &ldquo;How you have fallen from heaven, / O Daystar, son of the dawn! / How you have been hewn down to earth, / You who made nations fall prostrate! / But you, you said in your heart: / I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High. / But you will be brought down to Sheol, / To the uttermost parts of the pit.&rdquo; Bible scholars acknowledge that these verses refer to Satan. On the surface these verses are about the king of Babylon, but Satan was hidden in the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>In the same principle, Ezekiel 28:12-17 says, &ldquo;Take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, O you who sealed up perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, you were in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering...The workmanship of your tambourines and your pipes was prepared with you on the day that you were created. You were the anointed cherub who covered the Ark; indeed I set you, so that you were upon the holy mountain of God; you walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you. By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned. So I cast you out as profane from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness. I cast you to the ground; I presented you before kings that they may look at you.&rdquo; This portion does not speak explicitly of Satan but of the king of Tyre. However, Satan was hidden in the king of Tyre.</p>
<p>When Peter rebuked the Lord in Matthew 16, he was not being evil but good; however, Satan was hidden even in Peter&rsquo;s good. In John 13 Judas was also Satan (vv. 21-27). In Revelation Antichrist is Satan (13:1-8). This is a principle: Satan is hidden in persons, matters, and things.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the brothers and sisters are speaking, I am clear that they are brothers and sisters on the outside but Satan on the inside. They are children of God, but they are Satan on the inside; their words make them oracles of Satan. Satan often speaks from within our friends, relatives, spouses, parents, and children. He is not only in persons but also in things. Some things may be an embodiment of Satan, because he hides in and behind them. He has a cunning plan to disguise and embody himself in many things. This is another principle of Satan.</p>
<p>In Genesis 3 Satan was embodied in a serpent. The serpent was originally pleasant to the eye, being delicate in shape and having a beautiful pattern. It became hideous later because of the curse. The serpent may have climbed up the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and coiled itself around it in order to get Eve&rsquo;s attention. When he caught her attention, he spoke, and Eve was tempted. Eve did not know that Satan was in the serpent. Many people seem to be worshipping idols, but they are actually worshipping Satan, because Satan is behind every idol.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we can see Satan&rsquo;s subtle tactics. The principle of his activities is usually not to do things himself. He wanted to frustrate the Lord Jesus from going to the cross, but he did not do this personally; instead, he used a disciple who loved the Lord. Peter thought that he loved the Lord, but he had no realization that Satan was using him (Matt. 16:21-23). Therefore, we must be watchful. If our loving intentions and loving heart for the Lord can be used by Satan, how much more can he use our love for the world and the things of the flesh? If our considerations for the Lord and our love for the Lord can be used by Satan, we should not think that Satan cannot use other things. In fact, outside of God every thing, matter, and person is Satan.</p>
<p>Some saints may ask, &ldquo;How can someone such as me be Satan?&rdquo; But even their asking this question is Satan. If we understand Satan&rsquo;s tactics, we will realize that he is everywhere; he is in every matter, in everything, and in everyone. Everything outside of God is Satan. Satan is often behind someone&rsquo;s attitude and words; he is behind someone&rsquo;s glare and behind the things that gleam in our eyes. Many persons, matters, and things are Satan. If we understand this, we are blessed.</p><h2 class="head3">The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil<br />
Signifying Everything outside of God</h2>
<p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to everything outside of God. If we say that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is Satan, we are being too rigid. There are only two choices in the universe: God and everything outside of God. Everything outside of God includes many things. It includes not only your wife but also you. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil includes everything outside of God. The guiding principle is knowledge, good, and evil. Everything that is not God, that is outside of God, is indicated by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Every person, thing, and matter in the universe should be for God. God created man for Himself, not for other things or other matters. Wives are not for their husbands, and husbands are not for their wives; children are not for their parents, and parents are not for their children. Husbands, wives, parents, and children are all for God. All people, things, and matters are for God. However, people can choose God, or they can choose persons, matters, and things that are outside of God. The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything that is outside of God. God is life; hence, the tree of life signifies God. Everything outside of God is either knowledge, good, or evil and thus is signified by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Everything is included in these two trees.</p>
<p>The Scriptures are God-breathed and are of God, but if they are not used properly with the Spirit of God, they will be dead letter, that is, related to death. Death belongs to Satan. The Bible came out of God, but in this Bible God said, &ldquo;The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:6). If our knowledge of the Bible is not in God, it is the letter, which can kill us. Some may think that going to a movie theater is of death, of Satan, but that going to a meeting in order to hear a message is of God. This is not necessarily the case. It is possible for a brother to touch death, not life, while listening to a message, praying, or even giving a message. Death is Satan. Some believers preach the gospel because of envy (Phil. 1:15), some brothers administrate the church out of themselves, and some believers work for the Lord by their flesh. These are all of death. There is nothing that cannot be used by Satan. Even the people, matters, and things in a small family can be the embodiment of Satan.</p>
<p>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything that is outside of God. On the surface it may not seem that people, matters, and things are Satan, but they can all be the embodiment of Satan and be unto Satan. Hence, they issue in death. In contrast, the tree of life signifies God Himself and is unto God. Since God is life, the tree of life issues in life.</p>
<p>We should not think that Satan is only behind the wrong things that we do but not behind the right things that we do. Whether something is right or wrong is not the point; it is whether or not it is in God. Some may say that it is wrong to watch movies but that it is right to preach the gospel and pray. However, just as Satan can hide behind the watching of movies, he can also hide behind the preaching of the gospel and prayer. Therefore, the question is not whether we are doing the right thing but whether what we are doing is in God or outside of God. If our preaching of the gospel and prayer are in God and of God, they will be life. If they are outside of God, they will be death.</p>
<p>We must see that only God is life and that everything outside of God is death, not life. If God&rsquo;s word is not received in God, it is not life. God&rsquo;s word is life and should give man life. But God&rsquo;s word must be received in God or else it will be death. Anything that we do outside of God or apart from God, no matter how good or how great it may be, is death.</p>
<p>In the center of the garden of Eden there were only two trees. The tree of life signifies God. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything that is outside of God; it has Satan as its source, and it issues in death. The name of the tree of life, its content, and its nature are simple, because the tree of life signifies God. God&rsquo;s nature is life, and He is life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, however, is more complicated; it has knowledge, good, and evil, and it issues in death. In other words, Satan is hidden in all matters, things, and persons, that is, in every fallen thing in the universe. Therefore, the end of everything other than God is death. God put these two trees in front of man in order for man to choose whether he wanted God or something outside of God. No matter what man chooses, as long as it is not God Himself, it will eventually issue in death.</p><h2 class="head3">The Principle and the Content, Nature,<br />
and Issue of the Two Trees</h2>
<p>The content, nature, and issue of the tree of life are life, and the principle of the tree of life is dependence. Matters of life are in the principle of dependence. For example, our breathing is a matter of life. A brother who takes a deep breath when he gets up in the morning still needs to breathe during the rest of the day. He cannot stop breathing. Similarly, a sister who eats breakfast must still eat lunch. She cannot say, &ldquo;I am a veteran at eating; I do not need to eat anymore.&rdquo; Matters of life must not be stopped or interrupted. This is dependence. Even though we eat every day, we still need to eat every day if we have lived sixty years. We would die if we did not eat for a month, drink for a week, or breathe for two minutes. Life cannot stop or be interrupted. Therefore, the principle of the tree of life is dependence. The principle of the tree of life is to be dependent on God daily, that is, to fellowship with Him, live in Him, and never leave Him, not even for a moment. Whenever we leave God, we have death. Whenever our fellowship with God is interrupted, our sense of life and the light of life will stop within us. When we leave God, everything of God stops. This is the principle of the tree of life.</p>
<p>No one should ever say, &ldquo;I am a veteran at being in God and at having fellowship with Him, so I do not need to fellowship this morning.&rdquo; When we do not have fellowship with God and do not live in our spirit, the sense of life within us stops. This is death. The tree of life is a matter of life, and its principle is dependence on God, of not being severed from Him.</p>
<p>The principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is different. Its content is everything outside of God, its nature is death, its issue is death, and its principle is independence. The principle of the tree of life is dependence on God, but the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is independence from God. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil may be referred to as the tree of knowledge. Life is versus knowledge. Life requires dependence, but knowledge produces independence. The principle of the tree of life is for man to depend on God, but the principle of the tree of knowledge is for man to be independent of God.</p>
<p>For example, consider a hired servant who is told what household chores to do and how to do them. If she does not understand, she may need some help the first few days, but after she understands, she will do things according to her knowledge. Then she will not need to be dependent. We like employees who can work in this way. When a servant learns quickly and does things according to what she has learned, the employer will be satisfied. However, we would not be happy if our children learned everything and no longer needed us. We want to see our children in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. The more we see them and have intimate conversations with them, the happier and sweeter we feel inside. We are not happy if we do not see our children for a long period of time.</p>
<p>The children of God need to live in God by beholding His face constantly and having many intimate conversations with Him. As servants of God, we also need to live in Him. We should not consider ourselves as &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; servants of God, who know everything about God&rsquo;s house, who always do everything correctly, and who, therefore, do not need to see God&rsquo;s face. We must bear in mind that such servants are not well pleasing to God. There is no such thing as a veteran servant of God. God does not want service based on knowledge but service in life. Service based on knowledge is in the principle of independence, because a person can &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; from God. With service in life there are no veterans, for we can never graduate from, be apart from, or be independent of God. The service of life requires dependence on God. If we depended on Him when we gave a message yesterday, we still need to depend on Him in order to give a message today. We should not think that because a message was good in Taipei, it can be given in the same way in Tainan. Such an assumption is in the principle of independence. Knowledge makes man independent.</p>
<p>Some people say that since they have fifty messages prepared, they need to prepare only two more messages in order to be able to give a message every Lord&rsquo;s Day of the year. Such messages are according to knowledge, which results in death. A good message is in life. Those who speak life do not care about how many messages they know. Every time they speak, it is as if they do not know how to speak. They depend on God, fellowship with God, contact God, and live in the spirit.</p>
<p>Now we know the significance of these two trees. The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything outside of God. The content, nature, and issue of the tree of life are life, and its principle is dependence on God. The content of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is knowledge, good, and evil, that is, everything outside of God. The nature and issue of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are death, and the principle of this tree is independence from God. Therefore, when we depend on God, touch Him, and have fellowship with Him, we are living by the tree of life. When we are independent from God, we may still pray, preach the gospel, give messages, and live our daily life, but we have left God and are living outside of God. The nature and issue of such a living is death.</p>
<p>Just as Adam was placed between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man is still in between these two trees today. Man must choose God or choose that which is outside of God. If he chooses God, he will depend on God, but if he chooses that which is outside of God, he will become independent of God. If we always live in God and have fellowship with Him, we are choosing the tree of life. However, if we go away from God and become severed from Him, we are choosing the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>To touch the tree of life is to be dependent; that is, we look to God, depend on Him, have fellowship with Him daily, and always contact Him inwardly. Then even our visiting of the brothers and sisters will be the issue of our spirit contacting the Spirit, giving a message will be the issue of our spirit contacting the Spirit, and praying will be the issue of our spirit contacting the Spirit. When our living is a matter of contacting God, we are choosing the tree of life, which issues in life. Otherwise, we are independent of God and not relying on our fellowship with Him; instead, we are choosing the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us and unveil us to see that wanting only God and depending on Him in everything is to live by the tree of life. To want anything outside of God and to be independent of Him is to live by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Today we still have these two choices&mdash;God or everything outside of God. If we depend on the life of God, we are in God. If we do not depend on God but are independent of Him, we are outside of God.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, <em>the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</em> does not refer directly to Satan, but it is ultimately related to Satan. The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ultimately signifies Satan. Therefore, when Adam stood before these two trees, he was standing before God and Satan. On one side was God, and on the other side was Satan. Adam stood in between God and Satan. This picture fully depicts the condition of the three parties&mdash;God, man, and Satan&mdash;in the universe. God wants to gain man, and Satan wants to gain man. The struggle between God and Satan is focused on man.</p>
<p>Whether it is God or it is Satan who gains man depends on what man chooses. If man chooses the tree of life, he is choosing God and will be gained by God. If man chooses the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he is following Satan and will be gained by Satan. Man&rsquo;s choice in the garden of Eden had a great impact on the universe. God gave man the freedom to choose so that man could choose God or Satan. Choosing God issues in life; choosing Satan issues in death.</p><h2 class="head2">Wanting Man to Bear Responsibility&mdash;<br />
to Co-work and Cooperate with God</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:15 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.&rdquo; This verse says that God put Adam in the garden of Eden so that he would be responsible for two things: working and keeping. Adam&rsquo;s working the garden of Eden signifies the growth of life. The parable of the sower in Matthew 13 is in this principle (vv. 1-23). Hence, things growing out of the earth signify the life of God growing in man.</p>
<p>According to Genesis 2, in order for things to grow out of the earth, there must be both rain from heaven and a man to work the ground. Thus, concerning God&rsquo;s creation of man, this chapter says that it had not rained upon the earth and that there was no man to work the ground (vv. 4-6). This means that before man was created, God had not yet caused it to rain upon the earth, because there was no man on the earth, to cooperate with God. Consequently, life could not grow out of the ground. God fulfilled His responsibility when He created man and when the living water flowed out from God to water the earth (vv. 7, 10), but there was still another responsibility related to working the ground. Working symbolizes man cooperating with God so that the life of God can grow. God has His work, and man also has his work. God&rsquo;s work is to cause it to rain, and man&rsquo;s work is to work the ground.</p>
<p>In the parable of the sower the Lord Jesus spoke of man bearing the responsibility to deal with his heart after the seed of God had been sown into his heart (Matt. 13:3-9, 18-23). This dealing is symbolized by working the ground. After the life of God enters into man and the Spirit of God is sent down as rain, man still has the responsibility to deal with his heart. If man accepts this responsibility, the life of God will grow in the man of dust through his cooperation with God. The first responsibility that God wanted man to bear corresponds to the first aspect of His purpose, which is for man to have His life and live in Him in order to be like Him.</p>
<p>The second responsibility that God wanted man to bear was to keep, to guard, the garden. Guarding indicates dealing with the enemy. Man needed to guard the garden because there is a robber, an enemy, in the universe&mdash;Satan. Guarding corresponds to the second aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose. God put man in the garden of Eden to bear the responsibilities of working the ground and guarding the garden so that man would have the life of God, live in Him, be like Him, and deal with His enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Warning Man&mdash;Giving Man a Prohibition</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:16-17 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; Here God gave man a warning, a prohibition. God told man that the tree of knowledge was off limits. Man was not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because if he contacted the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he would die. Since the tree of the knowledge of good and evil refers to everything outside of God, the significance of God&rsquo;s prohibition is that man should contact only God; he should not contact anything outside of God. This prohibition is very severe. If God by His grace enlightens us to see this word, we would prostrate ourselves before Him, and we would no longer dare to touch anything outside of Him, because whenever we touch something outside of God, the result will be death. We must see the seriousness of this warning.</p>
<p>After reading the Bible, some people say, &ldquo;God is too jealous. He does not want us to love anything other than Him. Loving anything outside of Him is death.&rdquo; This is true indeed, because man was not created for anything other than God. Man was created for God; thus, God has the unique authority over man. Man is solely for God; therefore, man should not touch anything outside of God. People today touch many things outside of God. Unbelievers aside, even those of us who are saved touch things outside of God much of the time. Every day we are touching things outside of God; every day we are touching death. No wonder we are all so dead at the bread-breaking meeting. To touch things outside of God is to touch death; only to touch God is to touch life.</p>
<p>Today the universe is like the garden of Eden, containing God and the things outside of God. What will we choose? If we choose God, who is life, the issue will be life. If we choose things outside of God, which are the embodiment of Satan, the issue will be death. Some believers cannot open their mouth to praise or pray in the bread-breaking meeting because they love their children too much. With others their love of knowledge prevents them from opening their mouth. Some love their status, others love their clothing, and still others love their jobs. To love these is to choose things that are outside of God, and the result is to choose death. Hence, God warned man that everything outside of God is off limits. When we touch anything outside of God, we touch death. This is a warning and a prohibition. God prohibited man from touching anything other than Him. When man touches things other than God, he is corrupted and falls into death.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE THIRD STEP OF GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE<br />
TO FULFILL HIS PURPOSE&mdash;<br />
CAUSING MAN TO GAIN THE LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>In Genesis 2 there are three steps in God&rsquo;s procedure to fulfill His purpose: the first step is God creating man in verses 4 through 7; the second step is God having man receive His life in verses 8 through 17; and the third step is God causing man to gain His life in verses 18 through 25. This chapter covers the last step of God&rsquo;s procedure to fulfill His purpose. If God had taken only the first step to create man and the second step to have man receive His life, His life would not have been able to come forth out of Him and enter into man so that He could be joined with man as one. Therefore, there is the need for a third step, which is to cause man to gain God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Since God wants man to receive His life, He works so that man can gain His life. For the sake of receiving His life, God gave man the freedom to choose, and thus man bears full responsibility for his choices. Nevertheless, God still had to work in order for His life to be wrought into man. Without this further work after the creation of man, God&rsquo;s life would not have been able to come forth out of Himself and enter into man, even if man could choose freely. Therefore, after the first and second steps, there was still the need for a third step. God created man, and then He placed man in a position to receive His life, but a further work was needed in order for God&rsquo;s life to come forth out of Himself and enter into man. Only through these three steps could God work on man to the point where man becomes exactly the same as He is in order to be joined as one to Him as His counterpart.</p>
<p>The last account in Genesis 2 shows the last step of God&rsquo;s work through a symbolic picture. We should read Genesis 2 as if we were evaluating a painting or reading a poem. We should not merely read the letters; rather, we should contemplate and comprehend the symbolic meaning of all the items in this account in order to see the spiritual connotations. Based on Ephesians 5, we know that the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2 symbolizes Christ and the church. Adam typifies Christ, and Eve typifies the church. The joining of Adam and Eve as one flesh symbolizes the joining of Christ and the church as one mystical Body.</p>
<p>The account in Genesis 2 is very meaningful. Not only do we need to know that it refers to Christ and the church, but we also need to have a penetrating view that the relationship between Christ and the church is simply the relationship between God and man. The last step of God&rsquo;s work in this account is the working of His life into man in order to make man the same as He is so that man can become His counterpart and be joined to Him as one.</p>
<p>Let us consider the account in Genesis 2 step by step.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Background</h2>
<p>The background of the work of God in creation speaks of God&rsquo;s desire. If we read Genesis 2 carefully, we can easily see Adam&rsquo;s situation. At that time, there was a beautiful garden in addition to the heavens and the earth. God prepared everything that man needed for his existence. Adam lacked nothing. He needed the sun, so there was the sun. He needed air, so there was air. He needed food, so there were water and fruit. Everything was ready. Even his dwelling place, a very pleasant and satisfying place, was provided. Everything needed for man&rsquo;s existence was ready and available.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Adam was alone. Hence, in verse 18 God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone.&rdquo; In chapters 1 and 2 God saw that His work was &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and on the last day, after the creation of man, God saw that His work was &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (1:31). This means that the situation of the universe and in man&rsquo;s environment was very good. Nevertheless, something was missing even in this pleasant situation, because God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone.&rdquo; Except for this one thing, everything was good.</p>
<p>This may be likened to a young man in a wealthy family. His parents provide everything that he needs, including his house and furniture. Everything is good, and nothing is bad. However, something is missing in this wonderful situation: it is not good for the young man to be alone; he lacks a counterpart. Likewise, in the universe, all things were completed and ready, but a counterpart was missing. A counterpart is like a duplicate of the original copy; it looks like the original. The two are identical; therefore, they match each other. A cat cannot be a cow&rsquo;s counterpart, and a mouse cannot be a pig&rsquo;s counterpart, because they are not alike. They do not match.</p><h2 class="head3">It Not Being Good for God to Be Alone</h2>
<p>In Genesis 2:18 God said, &ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone.&rdquo; This indicates that the only thing missing in the universe was a counterpart for Adam. According to the Bible, however, Adam as a man refers to God. That it was not good for Adam to be alone means that it was not good for God to be alone. In the Bible God is in the position of a man, and the God-created man is in the position of a woman. In Song of Songs in the Old Testament the Lord is in the position of a man, and those of us who belong to the Lord are in the position of a woman. The Lord is our Beloved, and we are His lover (S. S. 1:13-15). Furthermore, prophets such as Jeremiah and Hosea declared that God is a Husband, and His people, the children of Israel, are His wife (Jer. 3:14; Hosea 2:7, 16). When God as the Word became flesh and came into the world, John the Baptist testified of Him, saying, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice&rdquo; (John 3:29). Later the Lord Jesus also referred to Himself as the Bridegroom, saying, &ldquo;The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them, can they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast&rdquo; (Matt. 9:15). The Lord Jesus also prophesied that when He comes again, those who wait for Him will be like virgins waiting for their Bridegroom (25:1-13). In the Epistles the apostle Paul said to the believers in Corinth, &ldquo;I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 11:2). Although there are males and females among us, truthfully speaking, we are all females before God; only God is male.</p>
<p>Our living in the world is like a theatrical play. While we are on this stage, some are playing male roles, and others are playing female roles. However, when a husband and wife kneel down before God in prayer, they leave the stage. Then in the eyes of God, both are female. When a husband and wife are living before men, one is a male, and the other is a female, playing in a family drama. When they leave the stage and kneel down before God, they are both female.</p>
<p>The only male in the universe is God Himself. A male is the object of a female&rsquo;s love, and he draws her heart to desire him. God, as the only male in the universe, is able to captivate man&rsquo;s heart. He is man&rsquo;s object and center. Although on the surface there is an order arranged by God, with brothers playing male roles and sisters playing female roles, we are all females when we come before God. This is the reason that Paul says, &ldquo;I betrothed you to one husband&rdquo; (v. 2); he also speaks of Christ as the Husband and the church as the wife (Eph. 5:23-24). Moreover, the Bible also says that Christ&rsquo;s coming back will be the time for His wedding (Rev. 19:7). Christ, the embodiment of God, is the Bridegroom, and those who believe into Him are the bride. We all have been engaged to, betrothed to, Christ, but the time of our marriage has not yet come. When our Lord comes again, He will appear to those who do not believe in Him only as a Judge, whereas to us who believe, He will also appear as a Bridegroom.</p>
<p>The wedding feast of Christ will last one thousand years. The millennial kingdom will be the time of the wedding feast revealed in Revelation (vv. 7-9; 20:6). In the new heaven and the new earth, all those who have been redeemed by Him will be the city of the New Jerusalem, which is His bride becoming the wife of the Lamb, living a life in oneness with Christ in eternity (21:2, 9).</p>
<p>God created and redeemed us for the purpose of preparing a counterpart, a bride, for Himself. As soon as we believed into the Lord, we were betrothed and engaged to Him. Since that day, we have been waiting for Him to come back. When He comes back, a wedding feast, the time of the millennial kingdom, will begin. After the wedding feast in the millennial kingdom, there will be a married life for eternity. In eternity God as the only male and those who have been saved by grace as His wife will live a life of eternity together. For this marriage Adam symbolizes God. That it was not good for Adam to be alone means that it is not good for God to be alone. God does not like to be alone in the universe. God wants man to be His counterpart. Hence, it was not good for Adam to be alone. This background shows that God is in need of a counterpart.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Desiring to Gain a Counterpart</h2>
<p>With such a background, God brought every animal of the field and every bird of heaven to Adam to see what he would call them. God might have wanted to test Adam to see if he could find a counterpart among these creatures. However, all the creatures that were brought to him were different from him, because they were not man. Adam looked at and named every creature, but he did not see or find his counterpart (Gen. 2:19-20).</p>
<p>This symbolizes that after God created all things, He considered everything that He had created to see if He could find a counterpart who could match Him. The account of Adam and Eve has symbolic significance. God built Eve to show His desire for a counterpart.</p><h2 class="head2">The Process</h2>
<p>According to Genesis 2:21-24, the process through which God built Eve is the same process through which Christ produced the church. Just as God produced Eve out of Adam, He produced the church out of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Becoming a Man&mdash;Adam Created</h2>
<p>The first step that God took to gain a counterpart was to become a man. Adam typifies Christ. Romans 5:14 speaks of Adam being a &ldquo;type of Him who was to come.&rdquo; Adam typifies God coming to be a man, that is, God becoming a man. In order to release His life into man, God needed to become flesh, to become a man. Without becoming flesh, God would not have been able to release His life, and man would not have been able to receive His life. As a man, Adam typifies God becoming a man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Passing through Death&mdash;Adam Sleeping</h2>
<p>The second step that God took to gain a counterpart was to pass through death. When Adam could not find a counterpart among the creatures, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him (Gen. 2:21). <em>Sleep</em> here signifies death; hence, the sleep of Adam signifies the death of Christ. Christ is God becoming flesh, becoming a man. In order to release His life, He had to pass through death. In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus spoke of Himself as a grain of wheat. He said that unless He fell into the ground and died, the life within Him would not be released, but that if He fell into the ground and died, He would bear much fruit.</p>
<p>In order to produce Eve as a counterpart for Adam, who would be the same as Adam, something had to come out of him. This is the reason that Adam had to sleep. While Adam slept, God took a rib out of his side in order to produce Eve. Just as Adam had to sleep, Christ had to die.</p>
<p>The death of Christ typified by the sleep of Adam is not related to His redemption for our sins. Adam&rsquo;s side was not cut in order to &ldquo;redeem&rdquo; Eve but, rather, to release his life in order to produce her. Therefore, Christ&rsquo;s death, which included redemption for our sins, also involved the dispensing of life. Adam&rsquo;s sleep symbolizes the life-imparting death of Christ that Jesus spoke of in relation to a grain of wheat falling into the ground to die in order to bear much fruit. Through death the divine life contained in Christ, as the one grain of wheat, was released.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 only a rib was taken out of Adam while he slept. There is no mention of blood coming out. However, when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, blood came out in addition to water (John 19:34). The water that flowed out was for the dispensing of life, whereas the blood that flowed out was for the redemption from sins. In Genesis 2 we do not see the aspect of the redemption from sins, because at that time sin had not yet entered into man. It is not until chapter 3 that sin entered into man. Hence, in chapter 2 we do not see the type related to the redemption from sins but to the dispensing of life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Flowing Out Life&mdash;Adam&rsquo;s Rib Being Taken Out</h2>
<p>When a deep sleep fell upon Adam, God opened his side and took a rib out of him. This signifies the piercing of Christ&rsquo;s side on the cross and the flowing out of water in His death (John 19:34). The water that flowed out signifies life. This is like the picture in the Old Testament of Moses smiting the rock and the living water flowing out (Exo. 17:1-6). First Corinthians 10:4 says that the children of Israel &ldquo;all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&rdquo; When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He told people, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (John 7:37). He also said, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (4:14). If we put these verses together, we will realize that on the cross the water that flowed out from the Lord Jesus&rsquo; pierced side signifies His divine life, which is typified by the rib in Genesis 2.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, not one of His bones was broken, whereas the bones of the two robbers who were crucified with Him were broken (John 19:32-33, 36). This signifies that the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life was not harmed by death while He was passing through death. The Lord flowed out His life on the cross, and with His life He produced the church. This shows that the third step in God&rsquo;s fulfillment of His purpose is to flow out the divine life from within Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being Resurrected&mdash;Adam Being Awakened</h2>
<p>The fourth step is related to Adam being awakened, which symbolizes Christ&rsquo;s being resurrected.</p><h2 class="head3">Producing the Church&mdash;Eve Being Built</h2>
<p>When Adam awoke from his deep sleep, he immediately saw Eve, who had been built with his rib (Gen. 2:22). Since Eve typifies the church, this means that Christ produced the church with the resurrection life that He released. The church is a woman.</p>
<p>Eve was bone of Adam&rsquo;s bones and flesh of Adam&rsquo;s flesh; in other words, she was part of Adam (v. 23). Eve was out of Adam; she was a part of Adam that came out of him. We can even say that Eve was Adam. Similarly, the church was produced by the life flowing out from Christ; hence, the church is a part of Christ, and the church is Christ. This matter is clearly presented in the Bible. First Corinthians 12:12 says, &ldquo;Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.&rdquo; The word <em>Christ</em> at the end of this verse obviously refers to the church.</p>
<p>When Adam saw Eve, he said that she should be called <em>woman</em> (Gen. 2:23). In Hebrew, <em>woman</em> is <em>ishshah,</em> and <em>man</em> is <em>ish.</em> These two words share the same root. <em>Man</em> is <em>ish,</em> and <em>woman</em> is <em>ish</em> plus <em>shah, ishshah.</em> Eve came out of <em>ish,</em> so she was <em>ishshah.</em> Similarly, <em>Christian</em> comes out of <em>Christ,</em> and a married woman takes the last name of her husband. The man is one half of a unit; the woman is the other half. When they are joined, they become a complete unit. This may be likened to two halves of a watermelon; when the two halves are put together, they become one complete watermelon. All those who know God realize that God is one half of a unit and that man is the other half. When God and man are joined together, they become one complete unit. The main point is that we must see what the church is. The church is a part that comes out of Christ and will go back to Christ. The church is out of Christ and unto Christ; she can be joined together with Christ as one. This is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Becoming One with Man&mdash;<br />
Adam and Eve Becoming One Flesh</h2>
<p>The sixth step is that Adam and Eve were joined together as one flesh. This shows that there was a person who came out of Adam and who could return to Adam. This symbolizes that the church, a group of people who are of Christ, is produced out of Christ and that they are joined to Him as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). At this point man has the life of God and becomes part of God, so man is joined to God, and God becomes one with man. May God open our eyes to see that this is the ultimate purpose that He is seeking to fulfill.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Issue</h2>
<p>When Eve was produced, Adam gained a counterpart. This counterpart truly matched Adam, because she was the same as Adam. Likewise, when the church was produced, Christ gained a counterpart in the universe. However, there is a difference. As soon as Eve came out, she was married to Adam. But after the church was produced, there is a period of time before she can be married to Christ. This is because Eve did not have the problem of sin when she was produced. The people who constitute the church, however, are sinners who are deeply fallen. Therefore, the church still has spots and wrinkles and other such things, and there is a need for Christ to continue working until the church is washed, sanctified, and without blemish (Eph. 5:26-27). When the church is made ready, the marriage of Christ will come (Rev. 19:7).</p>
<p>When Adam and Eve were married, God said, &ldquo;They shall become one flesh&rdquo; (Gen. 2:24). Eve came out of Adam and returned to Adam, and the two were joined as one. It will be the same when Christ and the church are married. At that time God and man will be fully joined as one, and God&rsquo;s ultimate purpose will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>At that time there will be a great rest in the universe. God will have rest, and man will have rest as well. God and man will enjoy rest together in full satisfaction. This is symbolized by Adam and Eve being married and enjoying a blessed life together.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORK GOD DESIRES TO DO<br />
IN THE UNIVERSE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GENESIS 2 BEING A MINIATURE OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:4-25 is a miniature of the entire Bible. At the end of Genesis 2, verse 24 speaks of two persons becoming one flesh, that is, of a husband and wife being joined in marriage. The record at the end of the entire Bible is a record of God and man being joined in marriage (Rev. 19:7; 21:2, 9; 22:17), that is, of God in man being joined with man as one. In the beginning of the Bible, Genesis includes a record of creation, and at the end of the Bible, Revelation includes a record of a marriage. Similarly, at the beginning of Genesis 2:4-25 there is a record of creation, and at the end of this portion there is a record of a marriage. Hence, the record in Genesis 2 is a miniature of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>The seeds of the truths in the entire Bible are included in Genesis 2. At the beginning there is creation, and at the end there is a marriage. In between creation and marriage, the most important matter is God causing a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and building a woman out of one of his ribs (vv. 21-22). In brief, the entire Bible records three great matters: the creation, the death on the cross, and the wedding in the future. The story of the cross includes how God works in order to prepare a counterpart for Himself. These three great matters are all hidden in Genesis 2.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FINAL ISSUE OF GOD&rsquo;S WORK IN THE UNIVERSE<br />
 BEING SEEN IN GENESIS 2</h2>
<p>There are three things in the Bible that are not found in Genesis 2. In Genesis 2 there is no sin, there is no law that was given as a result of sin, and there is even no redemption related to sin. The record in Genesis 2 says only that God took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side; it does not say that Adam&rsquo;s blood was shed. This is because there was not yet a problem with sin and, thus, no need for redemption.</p>
<p>From the picture in Genesis 2 we can see that the final issue of God&rsquo;s work is that by working the life that is within Himself into man, man becomes His counterpart, His duplication, exactly the same as He is, and God and man are joined as one. This will fulfill God&rsquo;s desire and purpose, and He will be satisfied and have rest for eternity. This is the work that God intends to do in the universe.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 is a picture of God&rsquo;s desire, and 2:4-25 is a picture of how God fulfills His desire. These two portions at the beginning of the Bible are like a general blueprint of a building project, and the subsequent books of the Bible are like the detailed drawings of the project. Ultimately, the record in Revelation 21 and 22 represents the ultimate completion of the project. We need to have this realization when we read the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING HELP FROM THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>What we have presented in these chapters is the essential significance of the Bible. This significance is absolutely related to the line of life. However, I am deeply concerned that some may merely use their mentality to understand these messages. If this is our case, we will not receive much help in life. Therefore, we need to fellowship concerning the way to listen to messages, to read the Bible, and to read spiritual publications.</p>
<p>When we listen to messages, read the Bible, or read spiritual publications, we must be well prepared. The first aspect of this preparation is related to the heart, the second aspect is related to the mind, and the third aspect is related to the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Matter of the Heart</h2>
<p>The first aspect is related to our heart. When we come to the Lord, whether to listen to a message, read the Bible, or read a spiritual publication, we should contact the Lord&rsquo;s word. Therefore, we must have a heart to contact God&rsquo;s word. I dare not say that a person will not receive any help if he has no heart to contact God&rsquo;s word, but such an experience is not common. If we desire to receive help from the Lord&rsquo;s word consistently, we must have a heart to contact God&rsquo;s word. Having such a heart means that we want God, God&rsquo;s truth, and God&rsquo;s word. Every time we listen to a message, we must prepare our heart, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I desire to seek You, and I want to seek Your truth and Your word. I open my heart to Your truth and Your word.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Matter of the Mind</h2>
<p>The second aspect is related to our mind. Merely having a heart without using our mind is not enough. In the matter of contacting the Lord&rsquo;s word, some people have a lack related to both their heart and mind. Such ones will not gain much benefit. Others have a heart, but their mind is not focused. Such ones will also not be able to gain much benefit. For a person to have an unfocused mind means that his mind is not calm and that his thoughts are scattered. Such a person is troubled inwardly, being full of anxieties and worries about many matters. He is unable to be disentangled from the things that are apart from the Lord. It is very difficult for such a person to listen to or read God&rsquo;s word. Therefore, we must be prepared in our mind. We need to ask the Lord to cause our mind to be disentangled from the things that are apart from Him.</p><h2 class="head2">The Matter of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The third aspect is related to our spirit. When we contact the Lord&rsquo;s word, it is not sufficient to merely have a heart and even to have a focused mind. We still must use our spirit to touch and contact the Lord&rsquo;s word. Our mind can help us understand and comprehend; however, only our spirit can truly touch God and the reality in God&rsquo;s word. Hence, we have to not only use our mind to understand but also our spirit to touch God&rsquo;s word. Only in this way can we receive the real help from the word of God. When we listen to a message, we cannot be a person without a heart for God&rsquo;s word or a person who does not use his mind to muse over God&rsquo;s word. Nevertheless, if we only have a heart and use our mind, we may understand some doctrines in our mentality, but we will not receive the real spiritual supply and help. We must use our spirit to contact God&rsquo;s word in order for His word to enter into our spirit to become our life supply.</p>
<p>If we desire to receive real help from the word of God, our heart, mind, and spirit must function together. We need to exercise our heart, mind, and spirit not only as we listen but even after listening. For example, after listening to a message, we need to turn our heart to the Lord and His word, using our mind to muse on His word and our spirit to contact the reality of the content upon which we have mused. At this time, the content of the message will enter into our spirit to become the bread of life to us so that we may receive the real help. Thus, the messages will not merely be doctrine and knowledge but a real supply of life to us.</p>
<p>For example, we have heard that God&rsquo;s eternal economy is to work Himself into us so that we can have His image to express Him on the one hand and have His authority to deal with His enemy on the other. Having understood these points, we should go to the Lord and turn our heart to Him and use our mind to muse upon them. After we have mused over each point, we will be open and readily understand the points. At this time we should use our spirit to contact the reality of what we have understood. We can do this by praying spontaneously to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I truly want Your eternal purpose to be accomplished in me. I long to be mingled with You to such an extent that I truly have Your image to express You and truly have Your authority to reign in my situations, not allowing the enemy to have any ground.&rdquo; At this time the words we have heard will not merely be doctrine; rather, they will enter into our being to become our life supply.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have heard that God&rsquo;s way to fulfill His eternal purpose is through His life: First, He created man as a vessel to receive Him. Second, He placed man in front of the tree of life in order for man to receive His life. Third, He was crucified to release His life into us so that we could become a part of Him. After hearing these points, we must have a heart that inclines to and desires these points, we need to muse over them with our mind, and we need to contact the reality of these points with our spirit. We need to realize that we have a spirit to touch and receive God, that God is life, and that we touch life when we touch God. If we touch anything apart from God, we will touch only death. At this time we will spontaneously pray, &ldquo;O Lord, I worship You that You have such a high regard for me as Your vessel. You have given me a spirit to fellowship with You, contact You, and even receive You as the Spirit. O Lord, You are life, and when I receive You, I receive life; when I touch anything apart from You, I receive only death.&rdquo; Such a prayer uses not only our mind but even more our spirit to touch the content of the words that we have heard. Those with experience can testify that when we use our spirit to touch the word, our spirit will receive the supply and be strengthened, satisfied, illuminated, refreshed, and revitalized.</p>
<p>If we receive a supply from the word of God in this way, we will surely be fresh and living when we enter into the meeting of the church. After singing the first hymn, we will immediately bubble over with a prayer: &ldquo;Lord, thank You that You made me a vessel and created a spirit in me so that I may receive You as the Spirit. Thank You that You are in me as my life. Now I am not standing in front of the tree of life, but instead, the tree of life is within me. I can draw near to You and fellowship with You in my spirit and touch You as the God of life.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, many brothers and sisters will be refreshed by us. Our prayer, like dew, will cause others to be watered and supplied. When our spirit has been supplied by contacting God&rsquo;s word, we will be inwardly fresh and living. As soon as we open our mouth to pray or to speak a few words, we will supply others in the spirit, making the entire meeting living.</p>
<p>I am concerned that when the saints listen to a message, they only nod their head but do not use their spirit. Merely nodding the head in agreement is not sufficient; we must bend our knees before God in our spirit, because God&rsquo;s word is not information or knowledge; it is the bread of life.</p>
<p>Our receiving of God&rsquo;s word may be compared to eating. There may be many varieties of food on a table, but if we use only our mentality to study and understand the vitamins and nutrients in the food, the food will not nourish us. We must use our mouth to take the food into us. Likewise, we should not come to the word of God to merely study and gain information but rather to receive the bread of life. After we understand the word with our mind, we need to use our spirit to receive and contact the word, turning it into prayer and absorbing it into us. Actually, we should do this not only when we read the Bible and listen to a message but also when we read spiritual books.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to use only our mind when we study in school, but we cannot do this when we read spiritual books. Therefore, we should not read a spiritual book too fast. After reading a portion, we should contact the word with our spirit. Then, after reading a little more, we should muse on the words again, turning them into prayer. In this way God&rsquo;s word will become a life supply in us.</p></body></html>
