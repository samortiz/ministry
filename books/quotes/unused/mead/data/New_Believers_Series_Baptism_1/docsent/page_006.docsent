   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone who is already baptized needs to look back and consider the meaning of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if you were baptized ten or twenty years ago, you still need to review this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should always remember the verse which says, "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse is spoken in retrospect, not as a forethought.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The verses in Mark 16, Acts 2, Acts 22, and 1 Peter 3 are for those who have not yet been baptized, whereas the verses in Romans 6 and Colossians 2 are for those who have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They address those who have been baptized already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is telling them, "Do you not know that when you were baptized, you died together with Christ and were buried and resurrected together with Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 6 emphasizes death and burial even though it also speaks of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Colossians 2 is more advanced; it emphasizes burial and resurrection, with resurrection as the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The emphasis of Romans 6 is death: "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The main point here is death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should die together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans 6 is on death and burial, whereas Colossians 2 is on burial and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The water of baptism typifies the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, when we put a person into the water, it is as if we are burying him in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we raise him up from the water, it is equivalent to raising him up from the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before one can be buried, he must first be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You cannot bury a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a person rises up again after he is buried, this is surely resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first part of this truth is found in Romans, and the second part of this truth is found in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. A Great Gospel I Am Dead</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He carried us along with Him to the cross; we were crucified there as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the eyes of God, He has terminated us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What do you think of yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may say, "I am a terrible person to deal with!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who do not know themselves do not realize how impossible they are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who knows God and who knows himself will say, "I am an impossible person."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we were heavy-laden with sin, we heard of the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we saw that we were beyond all hope and that we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is also the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank God, this is the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's death has included all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are dead in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a great gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just as the Lord's death is a great gospel, our own death is also a great gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as the Lord's death is a joyful matter, our own death is also a joyful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What should be the first thought that comes to our mind when we hear that our Lord has died?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should be like Joseph of Arimathea; we should bury Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Similarly, when we hear that we are dead, the first thing that we should do is to bury ourselves, because burial is the first thing that follows death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Death is not the end. We are already dead in Christ; therefore, the first thing we need to do is bury ourselves.</S>
