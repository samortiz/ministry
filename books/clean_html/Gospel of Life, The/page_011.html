<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER 10</h1><p><sup>1</sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter through the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up from somewhere else, he is a thief and a robber; <sup>2</sup>But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <sup>3</sup>To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. <sup>4</sup>When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. <sup>5</sup>But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers. <sup>6</sup>This parable Jesus spoke to them, but they did not know what those things meant that He spoke to them.</p><p><sup>7</sup>Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the door of the sheep. <sup>8</sup>All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. <sup>9</sup>I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture.</p><p><sup>10</sup>The thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly. <sup>11</sup>I am the good Shepherd; the good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. <sup>12</sup>He who is a hireling and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. <sup>13</sup>He flees because he is a hireling and it does not matter to him concerning the sheep. <sup>14</sup>I am the good Shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me, <sup>15</sup>Even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. <sup>16</sup>And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd. <sup>17</sup>For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again. <sup>18</sup>No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This commandment I received from My Father.</p><p><sup>19</sup>A division again took place among the Jews because of these words. <sup>20</sup>And many of them said, He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him? <sup>21</sup>Others said, These are not the words of one who is demon possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</p><p><sup>22</sup>At that time the Feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, and it was winter. <sup>23</sup>And Jesus was walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon. <sup>24</sup>The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will You hold our soul in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly. <sup>25</sup>Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works which I do in My Father’s name, these testify concerning Me; <sup>26</sup>But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep. <sup>27</sup>My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; <sup>28</sup>And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. <sup>29</sup>My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand. <sup>30</sup>I and the Father are one.</p><p><sup>31</sup>The Jews again took up stones that they might stone Him. <sup>32</sup>Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me? <sup>33</sup>The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself God. <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, “I said, You are gods”? <sup>35</sup>If He said they were gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, <sup>36</sup>Do you say of Him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God? <sup>37</sup>If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; <sup>38</sup>But if I do them, even if you do not believe Me, believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know that the Father is in Me and I am in the Father. <sup>39</sup>Then they sought again to seize Him, yet He went forth out of their hand.</p><p><sup>40</sup>And He went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at first, and He remained there. <sup>41</sup>And many came to Him and said, John did no sign, but all the things John said concerning this man were true. <sup>42</sup>And many believed into Him there.</p>
