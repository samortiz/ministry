 <h2 class="head2">Three Kinds of Wood</h2>
<p>We have to see that Christ is altogether a matter of mingling as symbolized by the Ark. The tabernacle and the temple were the enlargement of the Ark and were in the same principle, that is, the principle of the mingling of divinity with humanity. The temple, however, was quite particular in its constituents. For example, three kinds of wood were used in the temple: cypress, cedar, and olive wood.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Cypress</h2>
<p>Let us first look at cypress. Like the Chinese, the ancient Jewish people had the custom of planting cypress trees in the ground above their graves. Therefore, in its spiritual significance, the cypress tree signifies death, and in particular, the death of Christ and the death of those who have died with Christ. The doors of the temple were made of cypress wood, signifying that the death of the Lord Jesus is the great entrance into the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Cedar</h2>
<p>Next is cedar wood. This kind of wood, which came from Lebanon, grew on the high mountains. Today the national emblem on the flag of Lebanon is the cedar tree, which grows abundantly in that country. From a spiritual perspective, cedar wood signifies the resurrected Christ and those who have been resurrected in Christ. In the temple everything from the ground up was constructed with cedar wood. This shows us that the church is being built upward in the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Olive Wood</h2>
<p>The third kind of wood is olive wood. Olive wood was used for the doors on which were carvings of cherubim. Olive oil typifies the Holy Spirit. Hence, olive wood signifies the Christ in the Holy Spirit and those who are filled with the Holy Spirit. The doors of olive wood with the carvings of cherubim signify the Holy Spirit as the entrance to spiritual matters.</p>
<p>In summary, these three kinds of wood show us three great matters concerning the Lord Jesus. The first matter is that He died, the second matter is that He resurrected, and the third matter is that He became the Spirit. These three kinds of wood also show us who are the saved ones three aspects of our spiritual experience&mdash;our death with Christ, our resurrection with Christ, and our receiving the Holy Spirit with Christ. All those who want to be built together in the church must first be those who have died with Christ; that is, they must be cypress. Second, they must be those who have resurrected with Christ; that is, they must be cedar. Third, they must be those who are in the Holy Spirit with Christ, who have gained a spiritual entrance into spiritual matters and have a spiritual understanding of them, and upon whom the glory of God is manifest; that is, they must be olive wood. The church is constituted and built with these ones as materials. In the church there are no thorns, thistles, or other kinds of wood except cypress, cedar, and olive wood. In other words, in the church there is only the new man in resurrection and in the Holy Spirit, and in this new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free man, because all these have died and been buried with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Precious Stones</h2>
<p>In the temple there were not only different kinds of wood but also stones, precious stones, and other materials. Hence, the temple was more particular than the tabernacle. We must not only be those who have died with Christ, who have resurrected with Christ, and who are in the Holy Spirit with Christ, but we must also be those who are transformed. Previously, we were earthen and made of clay. Romans 9 says that we are like lumps of clay in the hands of a potter, who out of the same lump makes some vessels unto honor and others unto dishonor. On the day we were saved, Christ added the element of God into us, and we were changed from clay into stones. Therefore, when Peter confessed to Jesus, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,&rdquo; the Lord told him right away, &ldquo;Simon Barjona...you are Peter&rdquo; (Matt. 16:16-18). The name <em>Peter</em> means &ldquo;a stone.&rdquo; Later on in his first Epistle, Peter tells us that we, the saved ones, coming to the Lord, are living stones being built up together (2:4-5). When we were saved and regenerated, we were definitely changed. We are no longer pieces of clay but have become stones. Nevertheless, we cannot remain in this state and be satisfied with ourselves. We still need to let the Holy Spirit continue to do the work of burning and pressing that we may be continually transformed until we become precious stones.</p>
<p>In the temple we cannot see any element of clay. Rather, all we can see is bronze, gold, and precious materials. Therefore, do not consider the building of the church to be an easy and simple matter. It is not a matter that can be accomplished in a day or two. Instead, it will take a long time and cannot be done hastily or impatiently. The temple was quite great. The Bible tells us that it took seven years and six months and the labor of over ten thousand men to complete the building of the entire temple. The project of building the temple was not carried out in a loose or careless way.</p>
