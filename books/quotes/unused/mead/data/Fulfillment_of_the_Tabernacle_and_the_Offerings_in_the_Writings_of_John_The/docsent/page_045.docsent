   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Brass Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another matter concerning which Christians are very short in their realization is the brass serpent, which signifies Christ in the form of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may have read chapter three of John again and again without paying attention to the brass serpent in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The brass serpent typifies Christ in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 2 Corinthians 5:21 Paul says that Christ was made sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But many Christians do not have any realization of what it means for Christ to be in the form of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ was a complete Substitute for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we, as fallen people, are serpentine, it was necessary for Christ to have the form of a serpent but not its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In a previous message we pointed out that John 1:29 says that Christ is the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This expression was used by John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 3:14 the Lord Himself indicates that He was typified by the brass serpent lifted up by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lamb of God fulfills God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory were fulfilled by Christ as the Lamb of God without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, in order to be our Substitute it was not sufficient for Christ to be only the Lamb of God; it was also necessary for Him to be the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are two aspects concerning Christ as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first is that the sin offering must fulfill all the requirements of God, the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This aspect of the sin offering is fulfilled by Christ as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second aspect of the sin offering is that this offering must also be our substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are sinners and also serpents, the offspring of vipers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, it was necessary for Christ our Substitute to have the likeness of the flesh of sin typified by the form, the likeness, of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This aspect of the sin offering is fulfilled by Christ as typified by the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ did not have the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He had had the sinful nature, then He also would have needed a substitute, for He would not have been qualified to be our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But although Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin, He did not have the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was in the form of a sinner, but He did not have sin in His human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If Christ did not have the likeness of the flesh of sin, the form of a sinner, He could not have been our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regarding the sin offering, we have the aspect of the Lamb of God and also the aspect of the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, Christ fulfilled the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory and thereby accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the other hand, as typified by the brass serpent, He died on the cross as our Substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is both the Lamb of God and the brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, not many of today's Christians have the proper realization concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Human Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 3:6b says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we have another matter concerning which many Christians have very little realization.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This matter is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Often I have heard people say that before they came in contact with the Lord's recovery, they did not know that they had a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians do not know that human beings have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christians may talk about regeneration, but in their talk some may not apply John 3:6.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that they do not know in what part of their being regeneration takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The realization that regeneration takes place in the human spirit is very much lacking among today's believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In fact, many hold to the concept that the spirit and the soul are synonymous terms.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the Scriptures reveal clearly that our spirit is different from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone does not have the proper realization regarding the human spirit as our spiritual human being, it is difficult for him to understand the matter of regeneration.</S>
