   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We come together every Lord's Day morning and afternoon to listen to messages, and we come together every Lord's Day evening to break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Can we be considered good believers just by doing this?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Or should we pursue being good brothers or good sisters by trying to render help to the meeting and the church?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now I will narrow myself down from this broad realm to smaller matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The broad principles have been covered in the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we will cover only small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will pay attention to the matter of practice and not spiritual principles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will only mention the outward matters of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot cover the spiritual implications of these things at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As to the life of Christ and the Body of Christ, we may speak more about them in the future when the opportunity arises.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today He places this goal before man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's ultimate desire is to have the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God intends to put the church, which is represented by the New Jerusalem, into every city as a unit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before the New Jerusalem descends from heaven, God's goal is to have a miniature of the New Jerusalem in every city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that God desires to have a church in every city to express His eternal will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From beginning to end, the most important work God desires to do is to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason God establishes a local church in every city.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The local church is the miniature of the magnificent church of God, a small-scale model expressing the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The will of God is to establish the church, the Body of Christ, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this scope is too vast; how can we touch the New Jerusalem, which is in the new heaven and new earth?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can never grasp this firmly.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, you can come to Shanghai to achieve this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For in every city there is a miniature where God puts the saved ones and unites and assembles them together to become a local church and thereby express His will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you want to go on a big steamer to travel to a foreign country, you must first ask the officers of the ship for the directions to your cabin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once you board the ship, it is as if you are in a big city, and you will not know where to find your cabin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, you have to ask the officers to show you the way in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may show you a miniature model of the ship which has the same structure as the actual steamer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They may remove the decks layer by layer and show you how to go to your cabin step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After seeing this, you will have a clear sense of direction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you board the ship again, you will be able to easily find your cabin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The New Jerusalem in God's eternal purpose is big, while the churches He establishes in every city are small.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are miniature manifestations of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will study the things concerning these miniature manifestations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In other words, we will study the things related to the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not do this, we will miss the big things and also fail in the small things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am not here accusing you!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I myself am guilty!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In these many years of evangelistic work in China, very few have paid attention to God's emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Roman Catholicism has been in China for more than three hundred years, and if we count from Nestorianism, Christianity has been in China for over a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet no one has ever paid attention to the expression of the eternal will of God on a small scale.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But we also are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We only pay attention to personal victory over sins, overcoming experiences, work, and saving souls, but we have not yet seen how to express in a particular locality God's will concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>May God be gracious to us and cause us to see that personal victory over sins, overcoming experiences, and the work of saving souls are merely things related to the local assemblies they should not replace the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God's center is fixed on the church in every locality, and everything else should be joined to this center.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, our aim today is not merely to pay attention to overcoming experiences, victory over sin, preaching the gospel to sinners, and having prayers answered.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, we should go a step further and ask what we should do in order to be fitly framed together with other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Fukien is famous for its stonework.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The workmanship of the Fukien stone workers lies in their ability to cut uneven and odd stones into smooth and orderly pieces and put them together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The cut stones are not like the stones on Kuling Mountain, which are roughly mixed together to form walls.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Each stone in the workers' hands is finely cut and pieced together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although they are different sizes and shapes, they are joined together and match one another.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The question today is not whether this piece of stone is good or bad, big or small, beautiful or ugly, but whether this piece of stone is properly fitted with other pieces of stone and whether these pieces of stone can be built into a house.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many Christians today are very good, and others are extremely shining and beautiful, but they cannot be framed together.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are either too big or too tall; they just cannot be fitly framed with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every person who is saved is a living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, the question is not whether you are victorious, defeated, powerful, weak, good, or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The question is whether you can be joined with all the other living stones, properly fitted into the building.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you are a stone which leaves cracks between you and the other stones, you are not of much use in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During these few days, our study will concentrate on the things related to the assembly life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everything outside of the assembly life, such as the brothers' relationship with one another, mutual forgiveness, etc., has been covered during the past few Lord's Day mornings and afternoons.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All other points concerning our corporate life together will be covered in future messages on the Lord's Day morning and afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Presently, we will pay attention to how brothers ought to behave in the meetings as good brothers and how sisters ought to behave as good sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, we have decided to study the following subjects: the authority of the church, the fellowship of the church, the way to meet, the way to divide up our local assembly into one meeting on Wen-teh Lane and another meeting on Gordon Lane, and how the two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that the brothers realize that in this meeting we do not want just one person giving the message.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At any time questions can be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every brother can ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But when you ask questions, your voice should be loud.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you want to be a good brother, you must love the brothers' ears and not your own throat.</S>
