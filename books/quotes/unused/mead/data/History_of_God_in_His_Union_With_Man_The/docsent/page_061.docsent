   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous message, we saw the God of Abraham in His dealings with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we want to see how God worked on Isaac and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the Bible considers Joseph as a part of Jacob, we want to see God's history in the life of Jacob with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. WORKING ON ISAAC</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not forget that we are studying the history of God, not merely the history of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now that we have seen the history of God in Abraham, we want to see the history of God in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Raising Him as the Unique Heir to Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God raised Isaac as the unique heir to Abraham to inherit God's promise to Abraham and God's covenant with Abraham Gen 17:19; 21:10-12; 26:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some consider that Isaac was a good person, a meek person, and a person of prosperity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a superficial understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, he was raised up to inherit the promise God gave to his father and the covenant God made with his father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's promise and God's covenant are two great things inherited by Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul said that the unbelieving Gentiles were strangers to the covenants of the promise, having no participation in God's promise Eph 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today, however, in Christ we inherit all of God's promises and God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's covenant with Abraham eventually became a new covenant promised to the people of Israel in Jeremiah 31:31-34, and that covenant was fulfilled when the Lord Jesus enacted it at His table Matt 26:26-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the real covenant of God to His elect actually is only one, and that one covenant is altogether concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the centrality and universality of God's covenant with His elect, and this covenant is the new covenant, the new testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we are destined by God to inherit His promise and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His promise is a precursor of His covenant, and His covenant is with Christ as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we inherit is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaac's inheriting God's promise to Abraham and God's covenant with Abraham means that he inherited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a part of God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>B. Making Him a Type of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>as the Son of Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's working on Isaac made him a type of Christ as the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 1:1 says that Christ is the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God promised Abraham that the whole earth would be blessed in his seed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then Paul said in Galatians 3 that this seed of Abraham, not many seeds, is Christ v. 16 . Therefore, Isaac was a person who is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the one who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham Gen 22:17-18; Gal 3:16, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the Only Begotten Son of the Father</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Isaac was also a type of Christ as the only begotten Son of the Father John 1:14b; 3:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Given by the Father All That the Father Has</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Isaac is a type of Christ as the One who was given by the Father all that the Father has Gen 25:5; John 3:35; 13:3 .</S>
