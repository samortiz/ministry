<p>Since 1943 when I saw the light concerning the tree of life, my messages and writings have never departed from the matters of life and spirit. Hymns #11, a hymn written by me, mentions the word “spirit” nineteen times. Many preachers in Christianity give many messages, but none of them mentions the spirit. However, we have to know that the spirit of a man must come in contact with God the Spirit before he can be genuinely saved. If he has never touched Him, there is a problem. We must have a touch with God the Spirit. This is the basic element in our going to the home meetings.<p>Every time we meet with the newly baptized brothers and sisters, we have to touch their spirits. We should render them help according to this point. The Life Lessons can be used as a means, but they cannot be applied in a rigid way. We have to consider carefully if a point or a passage will touch others’ spirits or not. If others’ spirits are touched, we have to give them some further enlightening and revelation. After a person is saved, we have to have long conversations with him. During the conversation you have to tell him, “We have a spirit within us. The Lord has died on the cross for us to be our Savior. He has resurrected from the dead to become a life-giving Spirit to live in our spirit. These two spirits are now mingled to become one spirit.” You must explain to him this crucial point. At the beginning he may be listening with his mind. But after you talk for a while, he will be led to touch his spirit. This kind of fellowship must also be based on your experience. If you have no experience of touching the Spirit, you will not be able to do this. But if you have this experience, he will understand immediately after you explain to him. Based on this principle, when we go to the home meetings, we have to touch others’ spirits. We must open them up and enliven their spirits.<p>Following this, we must open them up further by telling them that we need to call on the Lord and to pray. To pray is not just to beg the Lord to do something for us. Prayer is a kind of calling on the Lord Jesus. This kind of calling is not just from our mouth but from the depth of our being, our spirit. Our spirit is the source of our calling on the Lord. We have to call from our spirit, “O Lord Jesus!” In this way, we will have a certain sensation; we will feel different within. In this calling we t<p>ouch our spirit, and we exercise our spirit.<p>After a few days, you should go see them again to ask if they have called on the Lord and if they have had any feeling after calling on Him. Then you should go on to touch their living. Take for example the playing of mah-jong. You can ask if they liked mah-jong playing before they were saved. What is their experience now after they are saved? If they say that the interest seems to have waned, you should ask them why this is so. If they say that they do not know, you should tell them that when they call on the Lord all the time, the Lord gives them the proper feeling that takes away their love for the game of mah-jong. This is not all. The more they call on the Lord, the more the Lord will touch them about the game. They will feel sinful and filthy when they touch the game again. We have to help others according to this principle. This is what we mean by feeding. When we go to the home meetings, the only way to render a proper feeding to the new ones is to do it on the basis of the experience of life which we have after salvation, corresponding to the word of the truth in the Bible.<p>Next January we will begin the work of gospelizing Taiwan. We believe that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes will surely succeed. But when we baptize people, we have to be careful that we do it neither too fast nor too slow. Nevertheless, we have to be fast in setting up home meetings with them after baptism, the sooner and the more frequent the better. It would be the best if we could do it once today, once tomorrow, and once the third day. If we feed them continually this way, they will surely grow in life.
