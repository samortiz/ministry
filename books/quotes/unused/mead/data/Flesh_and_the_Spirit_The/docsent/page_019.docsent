   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR A STRONG SPIRIT FOR GOD'S HABITATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Tim 4:22a; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4, 9-10; Gal 5:25; Eph 2:22; 1 Cor 5:3; Rev 1:10, 12; John 4:24; Deut 12:5-7, 13-14 GOD RESERVING THE HUMAN SPIRIT FOR HIS PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The flesh and the spirit are the real keys to our spiritual life and church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we mean business with the Lord for the Christian life and the church life, we have to see the flesh and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to realize that our flesh has been thoroughly polluted and corrupted by Satan's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regardless of how good we may be, our flesh is corrupted with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But thank God that with all the fallen human beings, God has reserved the human spirit for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is as if God has drawn a borderline to encircle the human spirit and protect it from the corruption of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This principle can be fully illustrated by the case of Job God let Satan damage Job, but He told Satan that there was a line.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Satan was allowed to go only so far.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God would not let him go any further Job 2:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that God did the same thing with Satan concerning the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God allowed Satan to damage the human race, but He allowed him to go only so far.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan got into the human body and damaged the human soul, but God preserved the human spirit for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we consider our past before we were saved, we can realize that although our flesh was so bad, deep within us there was another part preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When people are acting in the lusts of the flesh, something deep within them is saying, "You shouldn't do this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not right."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the voice out of the section of their being preserved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today, with us, the saved ones, the principle is even more clear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lusts in your flesh may urge you to go to the movies or to the department store.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While you are being urged to go, there is another section of your being deep within you telling you not to go.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Deep within the Lord may say, "Do you really mean that you love Me?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don't you remember the meeting in which you stood up and told people you consecrate yourself to Christ and the church?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do have the ugly flesh, but we also have a wonderful spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One part, our flesh, is fully possessed by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The other part, our spirit, is kept by the Lord and for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must have a thorough discernment of what the flesh is and what the spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A brother's wife may prepare a meal for him which is not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This offends him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Strictly speaking, this offended his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you are offended in your flesh, you will immediately react.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the inner part of this brother's being would say Hallelujah to his dear wife.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a struggle between the flesh and the spirit Gal 5:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a brother sides with the lust in his flesh, he will argue with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he remains in his spirit, he will say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus is Lord, even if my meal is not so good."</S>
