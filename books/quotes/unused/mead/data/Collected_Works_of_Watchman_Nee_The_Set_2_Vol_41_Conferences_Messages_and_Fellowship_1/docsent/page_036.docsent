   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CAPACITY OF OUR FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are different capacities to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every person has a different capacity of faith before God, in the same way that cups, bowls, and tumblers all have different capacities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mr. George M ller had a great faith; his capacity was great, and God did much through him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, faith is equally whole in everyone 2 Pet 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the same as saying that fullness is fullness, whether it is in a great vessel or a small vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the eyes of God, the measure of faith can decrease or increase.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation gives one sight and faith, but following revelation, one has to exercise his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When faith is added to revelation we have reality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Colossians 3:4 says, "Christ our life."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For Jesus Christ to become our life, God has to show this to us as a revelation on the one hand, and we have to believe it on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Philippians 2:13 says, "It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is God's responsibility to operate, and it is our responsibility to will and work, or putting it another way, it is His responsibility to will and work through me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A ten- thousand-ton ship at a shipyard requires only a little girl's hand to cut the ribbon, launching the whole ship into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's will may be likened to a ten-thousand-ton ship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As soon as I will and work, His purpose is realized.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we see that our sins are alive and the more we acknowledge that we are the chiefest of all sinners, the more we will experience a breakthrough in the matter of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Victory is not a change for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am an utterly hopeless sinner; fifty years from now, I will still be a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has no intention to change me for the better.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He wants to give me another life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The overcoming life that He gives us is an exchange; it is not a change in our own life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything is accomplished by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the day we were saved, the Lord has granted us the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our faith is great, we will see more of what God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our faith is small, we will see less of what He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Faith is not acquiring something new.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Faith is seeing what God has already given us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not have faith, spiritual things will still exist, but they will appear as if they do not exist at all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The eyes see things, but as soon as the eyes are closed, the things become invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The things are still there, but to the eyes, they are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation is always available, but it is possible for man to be without faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more revelation we have, the more faith we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The less revelation we have, the less faith we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we see the Lord's revelation, the more we will progress; the less we see, the less we will progress.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>FAITH NOT BEING DEPENDENT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>ON FEELINGS BUT ON GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faith has nothing to do with natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many village women have more faith than college professors.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not a question of whether or not one has knowledge but whether or not one has living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Faith does not come as a result of an artificial believing, nor is it based on one's feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our feelings are not trustworthy; only God's Word is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Based on his feelings, a little boy thought that his father would buy him a ball.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He invited many of his friends to come to his house and play in anticipation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When his father came, there was no ball because he had never promised to buy his son a ball.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, the father promised that he would bring him a ball.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the father made such a promise, the child only needed to trust in his father's word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same way, we should not go by our feelings or judge God by how we feel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should trust rather in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What counts is what God has said.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as we believe, the things will become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN FAITH AND TEMPTATION</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How can we tell the difference between faith that comes from God and temptation that comes from Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The key lies in the source of the spoken word whether it is from Satan or from God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Satan tempted the Lord, he also quoted the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He wanted the Lord to jump down from the top of the temple, but the Lord would not do it because the word was a temptation from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God said, "You can jump down," you could jump down even if you had a much higher temple.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If God has not told you to jump, however, you should not jump no matter how low a temple is.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you do, you are tempting the Lord.</S>
