   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The One in Whom We Have Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 14 Paul continues, In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The deliverance in verse 13 deals with Satan s authority over us by destroying his evil power, whereas the redemption in this verse deals with our sins by fulfilling God s righteous requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The forgiveness of sins is the redemption which we have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ s death has accomplished redemption unto the forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Christ, the Son of God s love, we have redemption and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we believed in Christ as our Redeemer, God immediately delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here in the light we are qualified for a share of the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that we are qualified to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because this qualification is an accomplished fact, there is no need for us to pray about it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, like Paul we should simply thank the Father for this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, there is the need for us to pray concerning knowing the will of God and walking worthily of the Lord to please Him in all things vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now that we are in the kingdom of the Son of God s love, enjoying Him in the light, we must go on to know Him in full and to walk worthily of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Image of the Invisible God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the portion of the saints, Christ is not only the Son of God s love but also the image, the expression, of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is invisible, but the Son of His love, the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance Heb 1:3 , is His image, expressing what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as the Son of God s love who has God s life and nature can express God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The image in Colossians 1:15 does not mean a physical form but an expression of God s being in all His attributes and virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This interpretation is confirmed by 3:10 and 2 Corinthians 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The image of God is the form of God s attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God has many attributes, and God s inward being is the totality of His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>An attribute is an element that belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is love, light, holiness, righteousness, power, might, and strength 1 John 4:8; 1:5; Lev 19:2; Heb 12:10; Psa 7:9b; Jer 23:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These and many other items are the elements that belong to God; hence, they are His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When these attributes are expressed, they become virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Peter 2:9 says that we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that we may tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here Peter uses the word virtues instead of attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Virtues are expressed attributes, and attributes are hidden or concealed virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Christ lived on earth, He expressed God s attributes in His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He expressed the divine attributes in His humanity as virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the divine attributes have an image.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This image is Christ the Son as the expression of the invisible God in the essence of His attributes 2 Cor 4:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How does Christ, the image of the invisible God, express God?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the Son of the Father s love, He expresses the Triune God because He is the One through whom both the old creation and the new creation came into being Col 1:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, He expresses the Triune God because He is the Firstborn of both creations vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>15, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This makes Him the full expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To say that Christ, the all-inclusive One, is the image of God implies that He is God, the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we see Christ, we see the expression of the invisible God, for He Himself is God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the image of the invisible God, God Himself expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Christ who is our good land, the allotted portion of the saints, is also the image of the Triune God, His expression.</S>
