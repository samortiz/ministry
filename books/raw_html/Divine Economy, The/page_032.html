<P>In the evening of His resurrection He came back to His disciples, who were frightened of the persecuting Jews (John 20:19). The disciples, who were under the threatening of death, had the door shut in the place in which they had gathered. Suddenly Jesus stood in their midst. The Lord came with a resurrected body (Luke 24:37-40; 1 Cor. 15:44) into the room where the disciples were. Luke 24:37 tells us that "they were startled and became frightened and thought they beheld a spirit." But the Lord Jesus said to them, "See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having. And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet" (Luke 24:39-40). The Lord had bones and flesh, but how could He enter into a closed room where the doors were shut? A limited mentality cannot comprehend it, but it is a fact! If the Lord were merely physical, how could He come in without an opening? If He were not physical, how could He be touched? All we can say is that this is the Lord Jesus in His resurrected, spiritual body, which is a body of glory.</P><P>Resurrection is a wonderful phenomenon. It is amazing that a seed can be sown into the earth and grow up into a beautiful flower. After resurrection, the Lord Jesus still possessed a body, a spiritual body, yet that spiritual body was still touchable. In the first step of incarnation, He became a man to be our Redeemer, our Savior; then He took the second step, the step of resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit to impart the divine life into you and me. He became a man to die for us, and He became a life-giving Spirit to impart life into us for God's dispensing.</P><P>Some traditional theologians tell us that the three persons in the divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;should not be confused and should be kept clearly separated all the time. But the Bible teaches that Jesus, the Son of God, became the Spirit. When the Lord Jesus was born, He became flesh. When He was resurrected, He became the Spirit. Some people argued with me by saying that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45b is not the Holy Spirit. I pointed them to the modifier "life-giving." Then I said, "Do you believe that there is another Spirit in the universe besides the Holy Spirit who also gives life?" In the entire universe there is only one Spirit that can give life&#151;the Holy Spirit.</P><P>We have to admit that the Lord Jesus as the last Adam becoming the Holy Spirit is scriptural and even logical, yet we may still feel that we cannot fully understand this matter. But we must realize that there are many things we cannot understand. Every person has two hearts&#151;a physical heart and a psychological heart. Jeremiah 17:9 tells us that our heart is rotten and incurable. This is our psychological heart. Our physical heart can be seen by being x-rayed, but who can point out where his psychological heart is? We know we have such a heart because we have emotions, thoughts, a will, and a conscience. We experience the action of the heart every day, but we cannot point out the location of this heart. In like manner, every man has a human spirit and a soul, but can any man point out the location of these parts of his being? All we can do is worship the Lord that we have a spirit, a soul, and a heart. Where they are and how they are related to one another, we do not know. We are limited in our finite understanding, but we can receive the facts according to the holy Word. The holy Word tells us many truths concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We receive these facts and say Amen to them. This life-giving Spirit must be the Holy Spirit. We may not be able to understand this, but we must say Amen to the scriptural fact and revelation that in resurrection the Lord Jesus as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</P>
