   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING OF THE CITY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BUILDING OF GOD S AUTHORITY OVER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To build the temple is to build God s habitation that God may have the ground in man, dwell in man, and mingle Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To build the city is to build God s sovereign power, God s authority, over man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We first must build God s presence into man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the initial step.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we need to build God s sovereign power, His authority, over man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the final step.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, first there is the church, the house of God, the temple of God, and then there is the manifestation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the building work we always build the temple first and then the city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s presence comes before God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, we build God s mingling within man, and then we build God s authority over man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although the temple is the center, the protection is with the city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person who has only the element of the temple, not the city, has no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If there is only a recovery of the temple, without a city, then the temple will have no protection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, after the temple was recovered with Ezra, Nehemiah still needed to recover the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was no battle during the recovery of the temple, because the matter of protection was not at issue; however, there was a threat of war when the city was being recovered because the city was related to protection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God s presence does not imply warfare, but God s authority is related to warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan s work in people is to destroy God s authority, not God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The ultimate purpose of God is His authority, not His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ultimate manifestation in the Bible is a city with the throne of God at its center.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that God s ultimate goal is to work out something in which He can reign and establish His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are mingled with God and have His presence, we can be joined with others as God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are mingled with God and have His presence can be joined together to become God s temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, this does not make us God s city.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be built to the extent that we are under God s authority, that we have God s sovereign power over us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only then can we be joined together to become a city.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we only have God s mingling, God can only have a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order for God to reign among us, we must have God s authority over us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the meaning of building is to build God s presence into people and to build God s reign over them, that is, to build God s mingling into people and to build God s ruling over them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there is no temple or city on earth, God is restricted to heaven and can reign only in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only when there is a temple on earth can God dwell on earth, and only when there is a city on earth can God s will be done on earth and His reign be exercised on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, when we have been inwardly built by God and thus have His presence, we will be joined with those who have also been built by God and thus have His presence to become His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then when we have God s authority and reigning over us, we can be joined with those who are also under God s authority to become a city.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, we must allow God to work in us so that we may be built.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there is a matter in which we are not mingled with God, we are not His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not allow God to reign in us in a matter, we are not God s city.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must let God build in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After we are built, we will know whether the inward being of a person whom we contact is desolate or whether he has God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will know also whether he has been built and has God s temple in him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Perhaps he zealously loves the Lord, but we touch only desolation in him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does not have God s presence when he deals with different things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At best, we can sense that he is zealous, active, and resolute, but we cannot see the temple in him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot touch God s presence in him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, he cannot serve in coordination with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to help such a person, we need to do the work of building to build God into him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In other words, we need to build God s presence into him so that he can have a measure of God s temple, God s presence, and God s mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this small measure of God s presence and mingling, we are also built into him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With this small measure of God s presence and mingling, he can be joined with us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With this small measure of God s presence and mingling, he is built, not isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we work on this person, the more God s presence and mingling within him will increase, God s temple in him will increase, and his joining with others will increase in measure.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more he is built in this way, the more he will be saved from being independent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more he is built in this way, the more he will be saved from being individualistic and the more he will learn to be joined with others to be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After we have worked on a person for some time, he will have some building in him, and he will eventually have God s temple in him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, he still does not have God s city.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He still does not know God s authority, God s sovereign power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The city is altogether a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the city and the tower of Babel were built on earth, man overthrew God s authority Gen 11:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we build God s temple into a person, we must also build God s city God s sovereign power, His authority into him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then he will learn not only to have God s presence but also to be under God s authority in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What does it mean to be under God s authority?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What is authority?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only must we see that there is authority and order in the church, but we must also see that the entire universe is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, when Michael the archangel contended with the devil concerning the body of Moses, he did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He only said, The Lord rebuke you Jude 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Matthew 8 the centurion said to the Lord, I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes v. 9 . This is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The entire universe is a matter of authority, a matter of order.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There is order in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Order involves authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This applies even more so to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since the beginning of Genesis, the universe has been in chaos because order was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the New Testament, beginning with the Gospel of Matthew, God has been doing a work of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As He accomplishes the work of recovery, there is more order.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>By the end of Revelation everything is in proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, when the city is manifested, everything will be under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The building work we are doing begins with building God s mingling into man and consummates with the building of God s authority over man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The more a person is mingled with God and the more authority of God a person has, the more he will be joined with others.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Merely having good conduct is not enough in the church, because the church is a matter of being built under God s authority.</S>
