   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Shanghai Being a Center</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the provinces of Kiangsu and Chekiang, the center of the work along the Nanking-Shanghai and Shanghai- Hangchow railways lines is in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, Shanghai must maintain a strong testimony, and Shanghai needs workers to maintain the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The responsibility of the rest of the localities in this region should be left to the brothers of their own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the same time the brothers in Shanghai should migrate to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After a period of time, the brothers in Shanghai should move out group by group.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Going out to preach the gospel is in the hand of the brothers and sisters; we are not sending people out to be pastors, but just to be emigrants.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please remember that the principle of Jerusalem is migration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was the method for preaching the gospel in the early churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One can say that they went out because of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But then where do we find children of God who do not suffer persecution?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, we must bear in mind that the path is clearly laid before us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Foochow Also Being a Center</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is how I see this matter today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I may illustrate it in this way: If the province of Fukien and the island of Taiwan are one region for the work, we believe that Foochow may be taken as a center.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, the brothers must support and maintain such a center by going out and coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we bring people to salvation, we should admonish them that they too must go out by the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should encourage twenty people to move to Nan-Ping, thirty to Putien, thirty to Amoy, thirty to Taipei, and thirty also to Tainan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they move out, the gospel will go out with them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The gospel will simply follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are expecting a considerable number of evangelists to be raised up within a certain number of years, not only will the expense be high, but the number of people going out will be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, we will not see much result.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Remember that the whole church must go forth to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is right for group after group to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Foochow there are apostles and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes two or three of them may go to a locality to visit and then return.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Two or three more may go to another locality and also return.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not saying that all the gospel work must be left in their hands from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps one or two brothers and sisters need to visit from village to village.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the gospel will go out only when these two ways of carrying the gospel are taken at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Ministry of the Word and the Sending Out</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We now can see that the work at the center becomes very important.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There we not only need to maintain the ministry of the Word, but we also need to send people out for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Regardless of whether they are peddlers, rickshaw coolies or domestic servants, they all must be sent out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason, we need to give all the brothers and sisters a proper training so that they will be brought to the point where they are ready to be sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fifty will be sent to one place and thirty to another place where they will be able to help the local churches without becoming a burden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the many who are sent forth become a problem and the local churches cannot deal with them, what good is this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the brothers and sisters need to be properly trained in order to be prepared to go out as missionaries group by group.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The co-workers must see that the work has to be centralized, not scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The locality which is the center first must be set up in good order before the saints can be trained and sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the past few years we have encountered many sufferings and difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have learned some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May we not treat these lessons lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to learn from these things.</S>
