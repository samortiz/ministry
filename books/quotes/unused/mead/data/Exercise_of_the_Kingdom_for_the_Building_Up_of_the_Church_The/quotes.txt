[1]  The Exercise of the Kingdom for the Building Up of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  In this series of messages we shall be concerned with Matthew 16, one of the greatest chapters in the Bible.
[3]  In this chapter Christ is revealed in an extraordinary way, and the church is mentioned for the first time.
[4]  This chapter also speaks of such things as the gates of Hades, the keys of the kingdom, and the building of the church upon the rock with so many Peters as the stones.
[5]  In Matthew 16:13-28 there are at least eighteen crucial items: Christ, the church, the kingdom, the gates of Hades, the keys of the kingdom, the rock, the stone, the building of the church, the crucifixion, the resurrection, Satan, self-denial, the bearing of the cross, the losing or saving of the soul, the following of the Lord, the reward in the kingdom, the coming of the Son of Man, and the coming of the Son of Man in His kingdom.
[6]  Instead of rebuking His disciples for these answers, He directed the question to them: But you, who do you say that I am? v. 15 . Then, to the surprise of the other disciples, Peter answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 .
[7]  The Lord said to Peter, You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father Who is in the heavens v. 17 . The Lord seemed to be saying, You are Simon, the son of Jonah, the son of a man of flesh and blood.
[8]  But flesh and blood did not reveal this matter to you.
[9]  We need to look to the Father in heaven to grant us to see that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God.
[10]  Do not assume that you know that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God.
[11]  When we were in Sunday school, we were taught that Jesus was the Christ and the Son of God.
[12]  We need the revelation that the very Jesus in whom we believe for salvation is the Christ, the oil upon us for functioning, and the Son of the living God, the water within us for life.
[13]  Forget about what you are or what you can do, and remember that you have received the Son of the living God into you as your life and that you have been attached to the anointed One.
[14]  Although you may not realize it, 1 and 2 Corinthians are the continuation of Matthew 16.
[15]  In 1 Corinthians 1:13 Paul asks, Is Christ divided? and in 12:12 he says, For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is the Christ Gk.
[16]  However, He came firstly not to express what God is, but to accomplish what God wanted Him to do for the fulfillment of His purpose.
[17]  For this reason, in Matthew 16:16 Peter said that Jesus was the Christ, and then went on to say that He was also the Son of the living God.
[18]  As we have seen, all that God is, is embodied in the Son and all that God does is related to Christ, the anointed One.
[19]  God s plan, His activity, and the accomplishment of His will are involved with Christ.
[20]  Whatever God is life, light, holiness, righteousness, love, kindness is embodied in the Son.
[21]  We are also attached to Christ, the anointed One, and become part of the corporate Christ, the Body, the church.
[22]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus speaks of the gates of Hades, which signify the power of darkness.
[23]  Verses 21 through 26 not only expose the gates, but also reveal the keys.
[24]  When you read this word, you may feel that you are not able to fulfill it.
[25]  After giving the revelation concerning Christ and the church, he unveiled the way the church is built.
[26]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said, And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
[27]  We need to know the genuine meaning of the cross.
[28]  If God s will had been that Christ should not die on the cross, yet Christ still went there and died, He would have been acting contrary to God s will.
[29]  We may apply the same principle to the church life.
[30]  In the universe there is just one church, and in any locality there should also be one church.
[31]  Some saints in the Lord s recovery, however, have tried to have their choice regarding the church.
[32]  After staying in a certain place for a period of time, they became unhappy with the church there, especially with the leading ones.
[33]  They have regarded verses 16 through 19 as a section concerning Christ, the church, and the kingdom.
[34]  Years ago we saw the revelation concerning Christ and the church and the prophecy that Christ would build His church.
[35]  In these verses we have not only the death and resurrection of Christ, but also three keys that we need to exercise: the denial of the self, the bearing of the cross, and the losing of the soul-life.
[36]  The Lord said that whoever desires to save his soul will lose it, and that whoever loses his soul for His sake will find it.
[37]  For both the losing of the soul and the saving of the soul we shall be rewarded.
[38]  Verse 27 says, For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each man according to his doings.
[39]  If we deny the self, take up the cross, and lose the soul, we shall receive one kind of reward.
[40]  With respect to the losing of the soul, the Lord did not speak about suffering.
[41]  Do not think that if you lose the soul, you will suffer.
[42]  If you have had some experience with this matter, you will know that apparently the losing of the soul is a suffering, but actually it is a real joy.
[43]  In this message we shall cover the matter of the salvation of the soul.
[44]  James 1:21 speaks of the saving of the soul, and 1 Corinthians 5:5 speaks of the saving of the spirit.
[45]  Christ is our life and life supply for the purpose that we might express God.
[46]  If He would remain in heaven and not get into us and be wrought into our being, He could not be expressed through us.
[47]  For us to receive God, we need a spirit; and for us to live Him out and express Him, we need a personality, which is our soul.
[48]  God s intention in His creation of man was that man would take Him in and express Him.
[49]  Man s happiness and entertainment must be God Himself, and this is not an objective God, but a subjective God.
[50]  We need to be those who care for the Lord s pleasure and satisfaction, and we all must believe the Lord s word.
[51]  He not only tells us that if we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven, we shall be cleansed, and we shall have eternal life.
[52]  AND A REWARD THE GOAL, THE MATERIAL, AND THE WAY
[53]  After the Lord Jesus had asked His disciples to tell Him who they thought He was, Peter received the revelation that He was the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[54]  Because it is not adequate simply to have the revelation of Christ, the Lord Jesus went on to say, And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church v. 18 . When verse 18 is put with verse 16, we have the complete revelation: Christ and the church, the great mystery of God Eph 5:32 . Christ is for the church.
[55]  If we are frustrated from knowing Christ and if we neglect the kingdom, we are through with the church because the church is built with Christ and through the kingdom.
[56]  Matthew 5:3 does not say, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs will be the kingdom of the heavens.
[57]  When we are poor in spirit, we are in the exercise of the kingdom.
[58]  In Matthew 19 the Lord Jesus illustrated how difficult it is for us to enter into the kingdom v. 24 . He said that it was even more difficult than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.
[59]  Humanly speaking, no one can enter into the kingdom.
[60]  But many times I have had the thought that I would like the young people to know what I am doing and to realize what a good example I am setting for them.
[61]  In verses 13 and 14 he said, Brethren, I count not myself to have gained: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and stretching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus Gk.
[62]  If we continue in this exercise, the kingdom will be ours, the church will spontaneously be built up, we shall be qualified to reign with Christ in the kingdom, and we shall be rewarded with the special enjoyment of Christ in the coming age.
[63]  Hence, in the exercise of the kingdom today, being ruled by the heavens, we are losing our soul, that is, losing the enjoyment of our soul; but in the reward of the kingdom in the future, ruling over the nations, we shall save our soul, that is, gain the enjoyment of our soul.
[64]  God s intention is to build the church with Christ.
[65]  Christ is the unique material for the building of the church.
[66]  However, in His sovereignty, God knew that His chosen people would not have an adequate desire to seek Christ.
[67]  Although many have received Christ as their Savior and are saved, they do not seek Christ.
[68]  But because God s desire is to build the church with Christ, Christ must be wrought into our being.
[69]  When we have been saturated, soaked, and permeated with Christ, we shall each be a part of Christ.
[70]  STIRRED UP TO SEEK CHRIST IN A DESPERATE WAY
[71]  When we have been compelled and encouraged to seek Christ, we shall not be idle regarding Christ, and we shall no longer be indifferent.
[72]  I must confess that I have a burden about this matter.
[73]  If we are filled, saturated, and permeated with Christ, we shall spontaneously be under the exercise of the kingdom.
[74]  As we read Paul s Epistles, we see that he was constantly denying himself.
[75]  His life was also a life of bearing the cross and losing the soul.
[76]  If we mean business with the Lord for the building of the church, we must be hungry to be saturated with Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[77]  Matthew 5:20 says, For I say to you, that unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens ; and Matthew 7:21 says, Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father Who is in the heavens.
