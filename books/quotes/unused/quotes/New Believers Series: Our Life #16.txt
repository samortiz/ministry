They think that the Lord set up a good pattern for us while He was on earth and that we should imitate this pattern
To some people this means that they can do all things when He empowers them and that they can do nothing when He does not empower them
We must first understand, see, and grasp the secret of Christ our life before we can imitate Him or ask Him for strength
They feel that the Christian life is like climbing a hill with a heavy burden on their back; they can never reach the top
If you live the Christian life by yourself, endurance will be a suffering to you, as will love, humility, and bearing the cross
For a proud person to try to live in God's presence and act humbly every day is a very wearisome and tiring task
Being a Christian is not an exercise akin to putting a carnal man in heaven and subjecting him to slavery there
Otherwise, as soon as he entered it, he would run away quickly; he would not be able to stand even one day there
In order for our crucifixion with Christ to become experiential, there is the need of cooperation from two sides
It is impossible to experience this crucifixion if there is cooperation on only one side; cooperation on both sides is essential
Just as our sins were settled more than nineteen hundred years ago, our person was also dealt with at the same time
If you take a piece of paper, write a few letters on it, and then tear the paper apart, you tear the letters apart as well
If you are looking at your own 'self' every day, hoping that it will improve, this self will become more alive; it will not die by itself
If we constantly frustrate Him by trying to do good and be patient and humble, the work of Christ will have no effect on us
The Lord Jesus has already given up on them, but they are still struggling and trying to come up with ways to live
On that day they will see that as God considered them hopeless, they should consider themselves hopeless as well
Brothers and sisters, we must remember that failure comes not because we do too little, but because we do too much
In the same way, as long as man is occupied with his own work, trying to do everything by himself, Christ's life will not be manifested
If we are working and operating, instead of the cross working in us and the life of Christ operating in us, this speaking will be in vain
