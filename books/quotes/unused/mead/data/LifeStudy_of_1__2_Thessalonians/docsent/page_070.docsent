   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO BE AT PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 13 Paul gives this exhortation: "Be at peace among yourselves."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To regard the leading ones and to be at peace with one another is a proper condition of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if the saints in a local church do not respect the leading ones, there will be no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The same principle applies to the family life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the children do not respect their parents, how can there be peace?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In such a situation it will be impossible for a family to have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In like manner, there will not be peace in an army if the soldiers have no respect for the officers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sequence of Paul's thoughts in these verses is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, we need to be watchful and sober in fighting the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, we must highly regard the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we shall be at peace among ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ADMONISHING, ENCOURAGING, UPHOLDING, AND BEING LONGSUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 14 Paul continues, "And we entreat you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be longsuffering toward all."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who are disorderly are idle or busybodies; they are not disciplined, but are unruled and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acting on their own, they are disorderly and do not care for the proper order in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to verse 14, all the brothers, not only the leading ones, should admonish the disorderly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that all the saints must function to shepherd others and edify them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 14 Paul also encourages us to console the fainthearted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Literally, the Greek word for fainthearted is "of little soul."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It refers to being narrow and weak in the capacity of mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are little-souled have a very limited capacity to bear sufferings or difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Among the saints there are some who are born with such a small soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They need to be comforted, consoled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 14 Paul also encourages us to uphold the weak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The weak here probably refers to the weak ones in general, who are weak either in their spirit, soul, or body, or weak in faith Rom 14:1; 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some saints among us are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They may be weak in body or in spirit, weak in heart or in will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some are weak in their faith or weak in praying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What shall we do with these weak ones?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Paul's word, we need to uphold them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 14 Paul exhorts us to be longsuffering toward all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This implies that in a local church, besides some being disorderly who need admonishing, some being of little soul who need consolation, and some being weak who need upholding, all the members may be a problem in some way and need our longsuffering toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we are still in the old creation, not in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason there are many problems among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to my experience, every one of us can be a problem to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I may be a problem to you, and you may be a problem to me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, we may love all the saints; on the other hand, they may cause us problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we need to be longsuffering toward all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not dream that the church will be a utopia.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, the church life is full of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a believer does not have any problems, it is not likely that he will come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who have no problems have no need for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a sense, the church is a hospital filled with those who are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, we need to be longsuffering toward all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not be bothered when others come to you with problems, even with problems that seem to be small and insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In particular, those who are little-souled may come to you with minor problems.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To such ones, even a hair is like a heavy weight.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of being angry at them for bringing such a small thing to you, help them to deal with their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, an elder may be irritated by one who brings a little problem to him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Elders, learn to be longsuffering, especially toward the weak and those with a little soul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Any brother who expects to be an elder must be longsuffering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul's word in verse 14, however, is not limited to elders; it is a word for all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A number of times saints have come to me saying that they cannot tolerate the church life in their locality and want to move elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I told them that if they move to a different place, they will find the situation in the new place to be even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If they travel from place to place, eventually they will probably prefer the locality where they began.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a common experience among church travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead of seeking to move to a different locality where you think the situation in the church will be better, remain where you are and be longsuffering toward all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because no church is heavenly, free of problems, all the saints, and not only the elders, need longsuffering.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, "See that no one renders to anyone evil for evil, but always pursue what is good for one another and for all."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that regardless of how others treat us, even if their treatment is evil, we should pursue good for them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not have longsuffering, however, we shall render evil for evil.</S>
