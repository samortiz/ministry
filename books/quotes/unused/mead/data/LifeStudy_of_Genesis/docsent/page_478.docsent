   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Capitals Being of Lily Work</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to bear the responsibility in this complicated situation, we must live by faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Kings 7:19 says, "And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The lily signifies a life of faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Firstly, we must condemn ourselves, realizing that we are fallen, incapable, unqualified, and that we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we must live by faith in God, not by what we are or by what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must be a lily existing by what God is to us, not by what we are Matt 6:28, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our living on earth today depends upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can we possibly bear the responsibility in the intermixed and complicated church life?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In ourselves, we are incapable of doing this, but we can do so if we live by faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not I, but Christ who lives in me this is the lily.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not I who bear the responsibility it is He who bears it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I live, not by myself, but by Him, and I minister, not by myself, but by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you sisters are mothers in the church life, you must say, "I am not a mother in the church by myself, but by Him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Song of Songs 2:1 and 2 the seeker says, "I am the lily of the valley."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then the Lord replies, "As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What earthly architect would have designed a brass pillar bearing brass capitals with lily work on the top of them?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Humanly speaking, this is not meaningful, but spiritually speaking, it is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, we are the condemned and judged brass; on the other hand, we are the living lilies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The brass means, "Not I," and the lily means, "But Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who are lilies can say, "The life that I now live, I live by the faith of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By all this we can realize that we are lilies bearing an impossible responsibility in an intermixed and complicated situation full of checkerwork and chainwork.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The elders should not say, "Lord, take these complications away."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, they should expect more complications.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am quite certain that the more you pray for the complications to be reduced, the more complications there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the checkerwork is the base, the bed, in which the lilies grow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the context, the chainwork, being wreaths, was a form of decoration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this decoration is filled with complications.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you come to my home, do not expect everything there to be clear and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you stay with me for a while, you will find many complications and complaints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But all this is the beauty of my family, for it is a wreath, a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every elder expects the church life to be clear-cut like a Chinese bean cake where every piece is cut square and neat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They want everything in the church to be accurate and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only place like this is the cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The proper church life, like the church life in Anaheim, is a net of checkerwork and a wreath of chainwork.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the place where the elders bear the responsibility in full.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This cannot be understood simply by studying the passage, but by interpreting this portion of the Word in the light of our experience.</S>
