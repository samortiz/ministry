   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Chapter Two THE DIVINE REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we considered seven mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now in this message we come to the matter of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>MAZES AND INFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without revelation, every mystery is a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even human history is a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, scholars, scientists, and religious leaders have continually studied the universe and the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through their study, they have discovered many things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most discoveries and inventions have come by way of inference, by inferring the unknown from the known.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we were young, we wondered about the meaning of the universe and about the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also questioned the meaning of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the years have passed, these questions have become more and more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I was a teenager, the young people were not as thoughtful as they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were uncomplicated and simply followed the older generation, accepting whatever our parents and teachers told us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During the past fifty years, a great change has taken place among the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today they are very thoughtful and questioning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They question the traditions and the old way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was the thoughtfulness of the young people that gave rise to the hippie movement in the 1960s.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In their questioning of the traditions, the young people are eager for something new.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I sympathize with the young people in this desire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their desire for something new causes them to make further inferences and discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without revelation, the whole universe is a mystery and is filled with mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, humanity is a gigantic maze.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During the time of Cain and Abel, humanity was not a maze because there had not been any inventions or discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, throughout the history of mankind, there has been one invention and discovery after another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every discovery and invention has paved a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, human society today is a complex crisscross of various ways.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, people are easily lost.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose there were just one street in the whole United States.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If this were the situation, no one could get lost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because in the New Jerusalem there will be only one street, no one will be able to get lost in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After anyone gets on the street, the street will guide him where he needs to go.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How much different is today's human society!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are many ways, not only in science and philosophy, but also in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE SOURCE OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In religion there are many different ways, but just one source.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Religion is a matter of teaching people according to your belief in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without God there can be no religion, because God is the source of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, Buddhism is not a proper religion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It does not have any God; rather, it teaches people that eventually they can become Buddhas.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because Buddhism is nonsensical and superstitious, it cannot be considered a genuine religion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What about Taoism and the teachings of Confucius?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Developed by thoughtful Chinese, Taoism teaches vanity; it has nothing solid.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only does Taoism have no God; it has nothing substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, it is not a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Likewise, the teachings of Confucius should not be regarded as a religion, because Confucius did not teach people to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Confucius did mention God a few times in his writings, calling Him the King of the heavens, or even the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even though Confucius mentioned God, his teachings are ethical, not religious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, Buddhism is nonsensical, Taoism is vain, and the teachings of Confucius are ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christianity, coming out of Judaism and including Catholicism and Protestantism, is a genuine religion, for it has the unique God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is the source of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Islam is a religion also.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Koran is an imitation of the Bible, particularly of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Koran even speaks of Jesus, saying that as He was being crucified, He was taken away by angels.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Islam's God is the same as the One revealed in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, God is the source of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No one can discover or infer the existence of another God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this reason, there is just one source for all religions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although Christianity is a typical religion, it also has become a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, not only human society is a maze, but even the religion of Christianity is a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Christianity there are many sects, divisions, denominations, and groups.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Moreover, there are numerous ways and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the reason many people have become confused by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They simply do not know which way to take or which of the so-called churches to attend.</S>
