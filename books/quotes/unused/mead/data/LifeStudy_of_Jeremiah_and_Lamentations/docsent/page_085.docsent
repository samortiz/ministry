   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH MESSAGE EIGHTEEN ISRAEL'S SIN AGAINST JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>JEHOVAH'S PUNISHMENT UPON ISRAEL 10 JEHOVAH AS THE POTTER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND ISRAEL AS THE POTTERY Scripture Reading: Jer 18 20</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The subject of this message is Jehovah as the Potter and Israel as the pottery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jehovah is the Potter, and we, His chosen people, are the pottery in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the Potter our God has the absolute right over us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regarding us, He has the right to do whatever He likes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This thought is found not only in Jeremiah 18 through 20 but also in Romans 9.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that Paul was considering these chapters of Jeremiah as he was writing Romans 9 concerning God's sovereignty in His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 21 he asks, "Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God, the Potter, certainly has such authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His selection is according to His absolute right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He may choose one vessel and reject another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has the full right to do anything in any way to His pottery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From Jeremiah's word in 15:10 17:27, we can see that there was something within him that was different from God's thought regarding Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe that the feeling within Jeremiah was that God's judgment upon Israel was too severe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At least he was not satisfied with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a sense, he was arguing with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of arguing with God directly, Jeremiah argued indirectly by expressing his feeling to his mother, saying, "Woe is me, my mother, because you bore me, / A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land" 15:10a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God did not give Jeremiah's mother an opportunity to respond but came in to speak with Jeremiah and even to argue with him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As God spoke to Jeremiah, He asked him, "Can one break iron, / Iron from the north, or bronze?" v. 12 . Here God was indicating that He was determined to use the Babylonians as iron to judge and punish Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Following this section in which he tells of his experience of arguing with God, Jeremiah went on to write a section concerning Jehovah as the Potter and Israel as the pottery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This section makes it very clear that God is absolutely free to do whatever He desires to His people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has the full right, just as a potter has the full right over the pottery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we see this, we will be able to understand these three chapters.</S>
