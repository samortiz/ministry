   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jesus Christ Our Lord</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to 1:3-4, the One who is the seed of David and the Son of God is Jesus Christ our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His name is Jesus, His title is Christ, and He is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus, a name given by God, is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua Num 13:16 , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, He is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is also our Joshua, the One who brings us into rest Heb 4:8; Matt 11:28-29 , which is Himself as the good land to us Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the title of the Lord according to His office, His mission.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek word Christos , which is equivalent to the Hebrew Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both Messiah in Hebrew and Christos in Greek mean the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is God s Anointed, the One appointed by God to accomplish God s purpose, His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His appointment is related to the Lord s commission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His commission is to accomplish God s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When this anointed One was crucified, He was carrying out His function as the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only His death but also His resurrection and ascension were part of His function.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Christ, the anointed One, carried out His function through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension so that God may dispense Himself into us for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our Lord refers to His lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus became the Lord after His ascension to the heavens Acts 2:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that a man from Nazareth named Jesus has been made the Lord of all 10:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the man Jesus Christ is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This lordship is now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Lord Spirit we have the elements of ascension and lordship 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever we turn to our spirit and call upon the name of the Lord, we should enthrone the Lord, giving Him the lordship in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must repent to the Lord and say, Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am not under Your lordship, Your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, I confess that I have been ruled only by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to allow the Lord to be on the throne within us, honoring Him as our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Seed of David according to the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>in His Humanity</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regarding the status of Christ, we should note that the phrase according to is used twice in Romans 1:3-4: He was the seed of David according to the flesh, and He was the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The two occurrences of according to in 1:3-4 show that the Lord has two essences the human essence and the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, Christ could be of two natures; He could be at the same time divine and human as well as human and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, He is a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is not only God but also man; He is not only man but also God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the complete God plus the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, many great Bible teachers through the centuries have considered Christ to be the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the seed of David according to the flesh and in His humanity v. 3 . Here flesh refers not to created man man as originally created by God but to fallen man man who became flesh through the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When God first created man, man was not flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, man s fall brought sin into man s nature, changing created man into fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Genesis 6:3 indicates that by the time of the flood, the entire human race had become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Christ became flesh as the seed of David, He became a man in the likeness, the form, of fallen man but without the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans 8:3 says that God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ does not possess any sin; He has nothing to do with sin 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15; 1 John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, when Christ became flesh, He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is typified by the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses for the sinful Israelites Num 21:9; John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The bronze serpent was in the form, the likeness, of the actual serpent but did not have its poison.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ was made in the likeness of the flesh of sin, but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh.</S>
