<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is a translation of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Chinese when he accompanied several overseas saints to visit Hualien, Taichung, and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. It also contains notes of fellowship given by Brother Lee in a co-workers&rsquo; meeting, a young working saints&rsquo; meeting, and a young people&rsquo;s meeting after he returned to Taipei. These messages were given on October 31 through November 12, 1977.</p>
