   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEW TESTAMENT COMMANDMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you think there are only ten commandments and that they are all in the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The pages of the New Testament contain more commandments than the Old.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here are a few.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 "Pray without ceasing" 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>5 "Be strong in the Lord" Eph 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>6 "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling" Phil 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not told to work out our salvation in joy or in shouting, but in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can we do this without being legal?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>7 "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings" Phil 2:14, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>. When you are about to murmur, you must remember this commandment and restrain yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you want to reason about church matters or why the elders behave as they do, remember you are forbidden to do so by this commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>8 "Flee also youthful lusts" 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here is a commandment the young people especially need to heed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>9 "Abstain from all appearance of evil" 1 Thes 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The appearance of evil leads to evil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These days I have heard some strange talk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It surely does not sound like the New Testament to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some are saying that they do not want any standard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To me this is ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything has a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have also heard that we should be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you think Christians should stay as they are, why does the Bible say, "Be transformed"?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you want to remain as you are?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I want to grow and be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have even said that we should not control ourselves but just let some flesh come forth and do whatever it pleases.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I would remind you that as fallen human beings we are capable of doing any lustful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God came in right after the fall to ordain restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is only because of such restraints that we are kept from indulgence in lust.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can you trust your flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever your age, however long you have been in Christ, if you do not exercise restrictions over your flesh, you are capable of any evil.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you say, "Don't be legal," I say, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE CONSTRICTING WAY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The standard in the Bible is the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens" Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We Christians must be strict.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We enter through a narrow gate and walk along a constricting way Matt 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"The gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it" v. 13 . To take a pathway of looseness is to choose the wide gate whose end is destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May we be those who are led to life by taking the narrow gate and the constricting way.</S>
