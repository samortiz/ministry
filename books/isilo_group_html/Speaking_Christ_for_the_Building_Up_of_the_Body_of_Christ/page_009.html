 MINGLED WITH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We also must learn to walk by and according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit (Gal. 5:16; Rom. 8:4). Praise the Lord that we have a spirit and that our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit! What a provision! Our God has created us with a spirit and has even regenerated our spirit. Immediately after regenerating us, He stays with us as the Spirit to be one with us and even to mingle Himself with us as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Now we have such a mingled spirit. After having a good start in the morning, we should continue to walk, to live, to do everything by this mingled spirit and with this mingled spirit all day long. We must learn to practice this.</p>
<p>Many married couples cannot avoid having problems with each other. Very few can avoid these problems because the husband and the wife are so close, and they know each other so well. They feel that they do not need to be careful, so there are always chances for them to get into the self or the flesh. These chances are snares and traps to get you. You must learn to walk and to speak, to talk, by the Spirit. Many times, Satan would send your spouse to tempt you. He or she may say a hard word to you or give you a long face. But at that time we have to learn how to walk, how to behave, how to have our being and living by the Spirit. Do not talk to your spouse by yourself. Talk to your spouse with the mingled spirit. This is the way that you can always be ready to speak in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING CHRIST FOR HIS MAGNIFICATION<br />
BY THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY<br />
OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and this bountiful supply is right within us (Phil. 1:19-21; Gal. 2:20). The Lord has given us a wonderful provision. First, we have His Word in our hand. Second, we have the Holy Spirit, who is the bountiful Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, living in us, in our spirit, which has been regenerated and strengthened. We have such a provision, and we can live Christ by this divine provision. If we are such persons, we will surely have something to speak when we come to the meeting.</p>
<p>What kind of Christian do you want to be? Do you want to be a cold, dumb, dormant, dying, lukewarm, defeated, and backsliding one? Or do you want to be a Christian who loves the Lord and who is living, refreshing, and active. Why is Christianity not powerful? It is because most of the Christians in the denominations have been stripped of their riches. They have been annulled and even choked to death. This is why they need a religious service in which one person speaks to them. But in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery it should be different. The Lord desires to recover a meeting with all the members speaking to function. But this depends upon our Christian walk. We must love the Lord, we must be revived, and we must live a victorious life. We must abide in the fellowship with the Lord daily and hourly, and we must be praying persons. We must enjoy the Lord in the Word early in the morning to have a new start of each day. We must walk and have our being by and according to the mingled spirit, and we must live Christ. If we are such persons day after day and throughout each day, we will be ready to speak in the meetings. Something of Christ will always be bubbling out of us. The Spirit will become a flow out from our innermost being to flow out all the riches of Christ by the Spirit (John 7:37-39).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
