   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Two Tenons with Two Corresponding Sockets</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only so, underneath each board were two tenons that were inserted into two sockets of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, there were two tenons with two corresponding sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our concept is that it would be more convenient to have one tenon set against one socket, but God s thought is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is also a matter of building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there was only one tenon, there would be no need for confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some brothers and sisters change so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The day before yesterday their condition was excellent, and yesterday it was also good, but today their condition is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason for their being easily changeable is their lack of confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such people, in whatever they do, always decide and act on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, they often use spiritual expressions such as, This is my inner feeling, or, This is something of God, and therefore, there is no need for others confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must realize that this is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact that each board was one and a half cubits in width indicates that we need to be connected with others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that each board had two tenons fixed in two corresponding sockets indicates that we need others confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If in our living and work we constantly have the confirmation of the brothers and sisters, then we will surely be well-protected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose one day a newly saved brother has a feeling to go see a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he would go and fellowship with another brother to seek confirmation regarding his feeling, then he would surely be clear concerning God s will in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then he would have not only one tenon but two tenons in two corresponding sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way, he would be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this is a very shallow example, it illustrates this most fundamental principle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Golden Rings and the Golden Bars</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lastly, on the boards overlaid with gold were rings of gold, and through these rings were bars overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything was golden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that you and I have to live in God, in Christ, and in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only when we live in gold, are overlaid with gold, and are joined and united in gold can we all be one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the gold covering had been removed from the forty-eight boards, then there would have been merely forty-eight individual boards, completely scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, since they had been overlaid with gold and joined together in gold and through gold, they became a solid entity, a builded structure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I say again that your measurement is one and a half cubits and that you are only half a unit, because you are a member and not the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You also need to have two tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If at present you have only one, you must go and find another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You definitely need two tenons for you to be stabilized and so that you would not waver.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time, you must realize that the coordination and oneness of the church, the church s being built, and the church s being one are altogether in the pure gold, that is, in God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When you live in God, I live in God, and all of us live in God, then we can be one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I look to God to grant every brother and sister to see that we have to be built together with others so that God can have a dwelling place and that the way to be built is to know that each of us is only one and a half cubits, that each of us needs two tenons, and that each of us needs to be overlaid with gold and united through and in gold.</S>
