Bringing to Light the Hidden Mystery of God&#8217;s Economy</h2><p>In Ephesians 3:9 Paul indicates that his teaching brought to light the hidden mystery of God&#8217;s economy. &#8220;To bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.&#8221; God wants to bring to light to all His creation the economy of His mystery which before the creation of the world was known only by Himself. This economy was hidden in God as a mystery. But now God wants to bring to light this economy to the intent that His manifold wisdom might be made known to the principalities and powers through the church (v. 10). This is according to the eternal purpose, the eternal plan, which God purposed and planned in Christ.<p>God&#8217;s mystery is His hidden purpose. His purpose is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Hence, there is the dispensation of the mystery of God. This mystery was hidden in God from the ages (that is, from eternity) and through all past ages, but now it has been brought to light to the New Testament believers.<h2 class=head3>7. To Be Known (Apprehended) by All the Saints</h2><p>The revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ by the Holy Spirit is to be known (apprehended) not only by the apostles and prophets but by all the saints. This is indicated by Paul&#8217;s prayer for the saints concerning revelation in Ephesians 1:17-23.<p>In this prayer Paul refers to God as &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.&#8221; In incarnation the Lord Jesus Christ, God Himself, became a man. As a man, He is related to God&#8217;s creation; therefore, God the Creator is His God.<p>The title &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; implies that God the Creator has come into man. Whenever we speak of God in this way, we imply that God is no longer merely the Creator outside His creature, man, but that He has been brought into humanity. The incarnation brought God the Creator into man, God&#8217;s creature.<p>This title implies creation, incarnation, and redemption. God is the Creator; yet He is the God of Jesus Christ, who is God incarnate. Jesus Christ is not only God in creation but also God in incarnation and redemption. In referring to God as the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, we are saying that we have been created, that the creating God has come into humanity, and that we have been redeemed.<p>In 1:17 Paul also uses the term &#8220;the Father of glory.&#8221; Glory is God expressed. Hence, the Father of glory is God expressed through His many sons. The title &#8220;Father&#8221; implies regeneration, and the word &#8220;glory&#8221; implies expression. Therefore, the title &#8220;Father of glory&#8221; implies regeneration and expression. We have been regenerated by God, and we are His expression.<p>In this one title, &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,&#8221; five important things are implied: creation, incarnation, redemption, regeneration, and expression. The regeneration of many sons and the expression of God are for the consummation of the divine economy. Before creation there was nothing in existence except God. God had neither generation nor expression. Then God created the universe and everything in it. By His work of creation He became the Creator. After creation He took the step of incarnation, thereby coming into His creature, man. Furthermore, through crucifixion the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption. As a result, we, the fallen creatures, were redeemed. Then we were regenerated to become sons of God the Father so that we may express Him. On the day we are glorified God will be fully expressed from within us. In this way we shall become His expression. All these important steps-creation, incarnation, redemption, regeneration, and expression-are implied by the title &#8220;the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory.&#8221; Paul prayed to such a divine Person.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
