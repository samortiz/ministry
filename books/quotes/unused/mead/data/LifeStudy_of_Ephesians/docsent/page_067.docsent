   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ONCE FAR OFF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to appreciate verse 13, we need to review the main points in verses 11 and 12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we were saved, we were the nations in the flesh, those who were called uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The man whom God created to fulfill His purpose was pure, without sin or any negative mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, sin, the evil nature of Satan, entered into man through the fall, firstly causing man s body to become the flesh, full of lusts, and eventually causing man s whole being to become the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, man was damaged and could not fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then God came in to call out of fallen mankind a race Abraham and his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For the accomplishment of His purpose, God commanded them to be circumcised, that is, to put away their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This separated God s people from fallen mankind and delivered them out of the fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Circumcision made a tremendous distinction between them and the rest of mankind, who were henceforth regarded as the uncircumcision, those who remain in the fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We were in that category before we were brought into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we were separated from Israel, out of which Christ came, we were separated from Christ and had nothing to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, we were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, we had no hope, we were without God, and we were in the satanic system of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we were far off from Christ, from the commonwealth of Israel, and from the covenants of God s promise, we were far off from God and all His blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>X. BUT NOW NEAR</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The precious words at the beginning of verse 13 But now indicate that now we have hope and we have God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are no longer in the world; instead, we are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Christ we have been brought near.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But to what, or to whom, have we been brought near?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been brought near not only to God, but also to Christ, to Israel, and to God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This equals being near to God and all His blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, in the redeeming blood of Christ we have been made near both to God and to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have pointed out that once we were far off from Christ, from the commonwealth of Israel, and from the covenants of God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This equals being far off from God and all His blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now in Christ we have been brought near to the very things from which we once were far off.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have been transferred out of our former status into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because our new position and status are in Christ, we are no longer far off.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 13 specifically says that we have become near in the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that we are not only in the Messiah, but also in the redemption accomplished by the Messiah.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Jews are still expecting the Messiah to come; however, they do not realize how much they need Messiah s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The transfer from our former status to our new status in Christ actually was accomplished by the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We were in a low status because we had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ shed His blood on the cross for our redemption, His blood brought us out of that low status.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now that we have been transferred by the blood of Christ, we are in Christ and in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we are near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are also near to Israel, to God s promise, and to God s blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, in this heavenly position we are one with God, one with the proper Israel, one with God s covenants, and one with God s blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we have been transferred out of the former status and into a new status, we can participate in all that is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is our portion in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have been saved from our fallen condition by life, and we have been transferred out of our former status by the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we enjoy salvation and we participate in all that is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hallelujah, we have been saved and transferred!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Chapter two presents a clear picture of how we have been saved from our miserable condition to be God s masterpiece and of how we have been transferred from our former position and status to become the new man, the commonwealth of God, the household of God, and the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the revelation in Ephesians 2.</S>
