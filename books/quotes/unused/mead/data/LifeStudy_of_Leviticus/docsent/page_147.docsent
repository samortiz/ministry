   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This signifies that after the observation of a complete period of time, if the problem of the church is still spreading, the believer or believers involved in the problem should be removed from the fellowship of the church and be considered unclean, like the outsiders cf.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the church becomes sick with leprosy, it often becomes necessary to remove from the fellowship of the church the saints who are involved in the problem.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is typified by taking other mortar and plastering the house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not a matter of simply dealing with a problem but of bringing in the riches of Christ in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are unable to do this but simply do something in a legal way to remove certain persons and replace them with others, this will make the church empty, and in this emptiness the church will suffer even more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the leading ones need to pray, perhaps with fasting, that the church will receive something new in the experiences of Christ's gracious works.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the church life will be renewed, replastered with new mortar, and all the members will be happy about the renewed church life.</S>
