<h2 class="head3">3. Having Confirmed the New Covenant<br />and Found Eternal Redemption</h2><p>By ascending to the heavens, Christ has confirmed the new covenant and found eternal redemption (9:12). His ascension to the heavens confirmed the new covenant that He consummated on earth. There, in the heavens, He found eternal redemption for us.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Having Obtained a More Excellent Ministry</h2><p>Christ has obtained a more excellent ministry (8:6). His ministry on the throne today is more excellent than that of the Old Testament priests in the tabernacle. This is His ministry in the Holy of Holies.</p><h2 class="head3">5. As the Surety and Mediator<br />of the New Covenant, Enforcing the Covenant</h2><p>As the Surety and Mediator of the new covenant, Christ enforces the covenant (7:22; 8:6; 9:15). In Greek the word surety means both a guarantee and a person who is a bondsman or sponsor. Christ is the Surety of the new covenant, the One who enforces it.</p><h2 class="head3">6. As the Executor of the New Testament, Executing the Testament</h2><p>As the Executor of the New Testament, Christ executes that testament (9:16-17). Christ is the Surety of the covenant and the Executor of the testament. For the will there is a need of an executor, someone to execute it. In His ascension, Christ is the Executor of the testament He bequeathed to us.</p><h2 class="head3">7. As the High Priest, Interceding for Us<br />and Saving Us to the Uttermost</h2><p>Christ is the High Priest who intercedes for us and saves us to the uttermost (7:25-26). This is not according to the order of Aaron on earth but according to the order of Melchisedec in heaven.</p><h2 class="head3">8. As the Heavenly Minister,<br />Ministering Heaven, Life, and Power into Us</h2><p>As the heavenly Minister, Christ ministers heaven, life, and power into us (8:2) that we may live the heavenly life on earth. This is not merely to save us from the negative things but to sustain us with the heavenly supply of the divine life.</p><h2 class="head3">9. As the Sanctifier, Sanctifying Us<br />with His Holy Nature and Life</h2><p>Christ is also the Sanctifier sanctifying us with His holy nature and life (2:11). He has sanctified us with His blood through His offering on the cross. That was the objective, positional sanctification which He accomplished for us on earth. Now He is sanctifying us with His holy nature and life. This is the subjective, dispositional sanctification which He is accomplishing for us in heaven.</p><h2 class="head3">10. As the Perfecter of Faith, Perfecting Us<br />in Faith for Our Life</h2><p>Christ is the Perfecter of faith (12:2). As such a Perfecter, He is perfecting us in faith for our daily life. As the Author, the Originator, of our faith, He originated faith on earth. He is now perfecting faith for us in heaven that we may live and walk by His faith.</p><h2 class="head3">11. As the Captain of Our Salvation,<br />Leading Us Into Glory</h2><p>Christ is also the Captain of our salvation leading us into glory (2:10). All that He is doing in heaven today is to bring us into His glory for the full expression of God. This is the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p><p>All of these eleven items are Christ&rsquo;s more excellent ministry in heaven today.</p>
