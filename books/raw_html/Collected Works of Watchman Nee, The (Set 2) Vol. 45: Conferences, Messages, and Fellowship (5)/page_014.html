<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">TALKS</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: October 29, 1940<br />Place: Unrecorded</h1><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />BUFFETING OUR BODIES AND ASCETICISM</h2><p>Sister Ruth Lee asked: What is the difference between buffeting our bodies and asceticism? Paul said that he had learned to be content in whatever circumstances he was in. How did he deal with his body?</p><p>Answer: Asceticism is the denial of the proper needs of the body. Those who practice asceticism are not necessarily more spiritual than others. One brother refuses to use hot water to wash his face. He purposely clothes himself poorly. This is asceticism. Another sister once invited me to her house for a meal. She purposely cooked food that did not taste good. When I asked her why, she said, "I am ill-treating my body so that I can be spiritual. If I cooked the food too well, I would be indulging my flesh and would not be spiritual. I purposely ruin the food so that I will not indulge in fleshly enjoyment." It is true that a Christian should not crave ease and comfort and not covet nice food, but there is no need to purposely cook unpalatable food.</p><p>What then does it mean to buffet our bodies? Buffeting our bodies is to not allow the proper needs of our bodies to frustrate our spiritual life. This is true spirituality. Buffeting our bodies means that our bodies have proper needs, yet for the sake of the Lord and His work, we can forego the demand of such needs at critical times. If a Christian always demands that his needs be met, he has not learned the lesson of buffeting his body. Once I took hospitality with a brother in another person's house. During every meal he would stick his chopsticks into the dishes and turn the food over and over again in search of the choice meat. After that I declined to travel with him for the next ten years. Such a person has never learned the lesson of buffeting his own body; he has never learned to subject his body under him.</p><p>Practicing asceticism is denying the demand of the body when it has needs; it is purposely acting contrary to the law of the body. This is too much. However, if a person has never learned the lesson of buffeting his body, he is useless in the Lord's hand. Once I traveled with two brothers to another place. Both brothers were very active in preaching the gospel and were zealous in helping others. But at a certain point, both would suddenly lose their stamina; it would be impossible to drag them any further. They had to take a nap every day after lunch. Even when someone was waiting to fellowship with them or other matters were waiting to be settled, they would turn the other way. I could beg them, but no word or amount of nudging could move them an inch. This is setting the mind on the flesh, indulging in self-pity and self-love. Those who act this way have never learned the lesson of buffeting their bodies.</p><p>Chinese Taoism and Buddhism are filled with ascetic philosophies, but asceticism is not a biblical concept. Paul said that he made his body his slave (1 Cor. 9:26-27). This means that he directed his body to serve him. He was not bound by his body; instead, his body served him. Making our body our slave means that we do not allow our spiritual life to be hampered by the needs of our body. Those who insist that they have to use hot water to wash their face have never learned the lesson of buffeting their bodies or making their bodies their slaves. Of course, we should not abuse the biological law of the body; we should take care of its needs. But our bodies should be always under the control of our spirits. Some people insist on satisfying their appetite; they cannot suffer a little hunger. Some people insist on having adequate sleep; they cannot miss any sleep. Some people love cleanliness; they cannot stand any mess. Some people insist on sleeping on soft beds; they cannot stand hard beds. These are examples of not making our bodies our slaves. All those who feel that their spirits are willing but that their bodies are weak have not learned the lesson of buffeting their bodies. A person who indulges in such self-love is useless in the hand of the Lord. May the Lord be merciful to us, and may we learn the lesson of buffeting our bodies and making them our slaves.</p>
