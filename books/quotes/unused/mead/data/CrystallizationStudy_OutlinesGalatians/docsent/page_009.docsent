   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The consummated Spirit, the compound Spirit, is the divine and mystical realm into which the believers in Christ may enter today John 14:20.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Christian life is the living of the processed Triune God as the consummated Spirit in the believers Gal 5:16, 18, 25; 6:8: The Triune God has been processed to be the consummated Spirit to live in us, the believers in Christ John 7:39; Gal 3:14; 6:18.</S>
