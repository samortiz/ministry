   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A REPLY TO A MEETING IN LONDON Preface</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Several years ago seven believers from England and America visited Shanghai and requested fellowship with us at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We immediately received them because they were brothers in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We received them in the same manner we usually received brothers from different denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because they were of the "Closed Brethren," we made it clear to them that we received only their person, not the organization they represented.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, they urged us to take the same attitude and stand of which they were persuaded.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We brought it carefully to prayer, asking God to give us light and utterance to make this matter clear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our reply is made in the following pages.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the brothers in different localities read our answer, they will know the kind of fellowship in which we believe and why we cannot join the "Closed Brethren."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We desire that the brothers in every locality not presume that we fellowship merely with those who have left the divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must realize that what we emphasize is the fellowship in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Translator's note: The following letter is a translation from the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The original letter in English to the Closed Brethren in England is not available.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Letter</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It has been some time since we received your letter touching the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should have replied earlier but have lacked clear light from God; thus, we delayed our definite answer until today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your love and patience are required to bear with our delay, for we did not want to be hasty in our reply, thereby neglecting God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We beg your pardon, regretting the inconvenience we have caused through our tarrying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition, our brother Mr. Nee has had a heart ailment since last February and is only now gradually recovering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was another factor which contributed to the delay in answering you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We believe that those who have been taught of God should not trust themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"The flesh profits nothing," including the matter of understanding God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is very easy for one to acknowledge a certain truth in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the same person can be completely ignorant of everything, as if he has never heard the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The only condition for the realization of spiritual matters is for us to be in the Holy Spirit and in the life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is exceedingly easy for one to stand upon others' revelation and light, while at the same time he himself falls into law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament dispensation is a spiritual dispensation; therefore, man can or should be taught of God from within and have the inner knowledge Heb 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every matter coming from without including everything from the avenue of the mind , which stops short of reaching the inner depth, has no spiritual value, and those who acquire it have never actually known anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By saying this, we do not mean that we are unwilling to be taught by our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, we are assured that we can do nothing when the Holy Spirit within does not make the truth alive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The situation of death and weakness among the saints today is due to the fact that they merely receive and obey the truth in their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although their words are accurate, they are absolutely independent of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, we could only wait before God, trusting His Holy Spirit rather than depending upon our own minds.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We say with thankful hearts that by His grace He has given us light and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have the assurance that this light is from Him, we desire to share it with you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We earnestly beseech Him that this letter may be entirely of Him, without the slightest element of our human opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1 God's original desire toward the church is that she be the increase or fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus and the church are Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the individual Christ is joined with His church, they together become the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church in her life and testimony should manifest Christ and express His life, His victory, and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's original intention for this generation is that every child of His should be in the real church and become the testimony of His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2 Notwithstanding, how the flesh has missed God's goal!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even before the apostles passed away, the church outwardly became desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although man has had his sins forgiven and has become a child of God, he cannot manifest Christ or testify of His life, victory, and glory; only a minority can still fulfill God's original desire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The majority may have had a good beginning, but by their controversy with God, their life and testimony have been choked.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even to the present day, the church is divided into two groups, the overcomers and the defeated ones Rev 2 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not that the overcomers are those who are above the standard of ordinary Christians but that the defeated ones are below the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The overcomers are those who can fulfill God's original desire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>3 The matter of fellowship was not a difficult problem for the early church at Pentecost all believers at that time were saved sinners and saints with a testimony we will not speak of the exceptions .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today's difficulty is that these two matters have been separated among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although today's saints are saved, they do not live in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Should we then open our fellowship absolutely to all of God's children regardless of their condition?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Or should we limit our fellowship only to those who are overcomers?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Should we start a Christian laity movement?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Or should we answer the call for overcomers and go forward towards God's perfect goal?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to the letters to the seven churches, the Lord's call now is evidently for overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although the Lord did not reject the ordinary Christians, His eyes were on the overcomers who would fulfill His original desire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since we are meeting on the ground of the church in each locality as a local assembly, we ought to make such an assembly a vessel for the "testimony of Jesus" as the answer to God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To have a people's movement consisting of many saved people is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The assembly must be a special vessel for the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The overcomers are those who rise to fulfill the responsibility which the church herself has failed to fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The overcomers are in God's sight just as the church is in His sight we can compare them with the remnant in the former dispensation .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the meetings which stand on the ground of the church should have the character of the overcomer.</S>
