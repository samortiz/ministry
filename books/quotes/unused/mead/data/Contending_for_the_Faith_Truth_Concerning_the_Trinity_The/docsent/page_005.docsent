   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. All Three Exist at the Same Time</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father, Son, and Spirit all exist at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Notice John 14:16-17: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these two verses we have the Son praying to the Father that the Father would send the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all present at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 3:14-17 Paul says that he will pray the Father to grant us to be strengthened by His Spirit in our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this passage we have the Father, the Spirit, and Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All exist at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible does not say that the Father existed for a certain period of time and then the Son came; that after a certain period of time the Son no longer existed and was replaced by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is not a verse that says this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible in this passage indicates that the Father listens to the prayer, the Spirit will strengthen the saints, and the Son, Christ, will make His home in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here again, it is clear that all Three exist at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here are mentioned the grace of Christ the Son, the love of God the Father, and the fellowship or communion of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All Three are present at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 12:4-6 speaks of the Spirit of gifts, the Lord of ministries, and the God of operations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here we see the Spirit, the Lord, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once again, the Spirit, the Son, and the Father are shown to exist and work at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit is giving gifts, the Lord is ministering, and God the Father is operating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we do not believe that the Father has ever ceased to exist, that the Son came to replace Him, and that, after a time, the Spirit replaced the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We believe that all Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are eternal and exist at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>F. All Three Are One</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here is the real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you believe that all Three are one?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do, because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Son Is the Father</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us look at Isaiah 9:6: "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Who is this child?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where is this child born?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the manger at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Unto us a son is given."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Who is this son?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whose Son is He?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only is a child born to us, but also a Son is given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God gives His Son to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why is He called Wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because He is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not easy to understand Him, nor can we fully do so.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This child by the name of Jesus, who was born in the manger at Bethlehem, is also called the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Jewish people do not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They do not believe that that little Jesus is the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they believed it, they would immediately become real Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I believe it!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My God is Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My God is that little child.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That little child who was born of Mary in that manger at Bethlehem is my Mighty God!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His fourth name or title is the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Son who is given to us is called "the everlasting Father."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is He the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you believe that the child born to us is the Mighty God, you have to believe also that the Son given to us is the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To say that the Son is the Father is according to the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now turn to John 14:8-9.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jesus said to him, Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This word indicates clearly that the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet some twist this word saying that the Son is not the Father, but the representative of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you read the context without any twisting, you can realize that the Son was the Father there.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Philip asked the Son to show him the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Son was surprised, saying, "I have been with you such a long time and you have seen Me. Since you have seen Me, you have seen the Father." Here we may say to Philip, "Haven't you read Isaiah? It tells you that the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since He is here, why do you ask Him to show you the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>So, He said, "I and the Father are one" John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The following is a quotation taped at a meeting of some people who were discussing how to deal with our so-called heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In their conversation this was said: "...Anyway, Isaiah 9:6, For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the Prince of Peace, the mighty God, the everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There Jesus is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Right?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>So He's the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>That's what it says.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That's Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Now we don't normally say this because tradition is involved here."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Please notice this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These critics admit that, for fear of their tradition, they normally do not say that Jesus is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They dare not speak the truth, yet they turn their attack upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Are we for traditions?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do you care for traditions?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In every Christian's conscience and mind, he must admit that in Isaiah 9:6 the Son is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am glad that in the midst of the opposers' attack, there is this honest word, admitting that, according to the clear word of Isaiah 9:6, Jesus is the Father, even though they do not normally say this because it involves the matter of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some, however, have twisted this verse, saying, "The Son is called the Father, but He is not the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is ridiculous!</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You are called by a certain name, yet you are not that person!</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once a certain man said to me, "This Father here is not God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He is the Father that brought forth the race of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I said, "Don't say this.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Here it does not say the Father of Israel'; it says, the Father of eternity.'</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If you say that the Son who is called Father is not the Father, then you must also admit that the child who is called the Mighty God is not the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But certainly the child is the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Thus, as long as you admit the one, you must recognize the other."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>No sober mind would deny this.</S>
