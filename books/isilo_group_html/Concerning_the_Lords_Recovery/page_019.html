But at the same time we also have the realization that we are satisfied. That is why we are so happy. We are happy not only because our sins are forgiven. We are happy because we have something within. That something is the meal offering. Christ as the meal offering feeds us and strengthens us to serve God. Eventually there is the peace offering which is good for fellowship. With the peace offering there is a kind of feast for the offerer and the priest who offers the offering and also for all the other parties who are there and for God. This is very much like the New Testament fellowship which we have at the Lord's table. In a sense the Lord's table is a peace offering.</P><P>Isn't this wonderful? But I am sorry to say that most Christians have only enjoyed Christ as their trespass offering and sin offering. Many don't even know what is the difference between the trespass offering and the sin offering. This is the poor situation of today's Christians. Few realize at the time of their conversion that Christ is their burnt offering to God for God's satisfaction, and Christ is the meal offering for them to feed God and to feed themselves. Very few realize how much they need the peace offering and how much they need to come into the fellowship with the saints around the Lord's table to enjoy Him with God and before God and with one another. What most Christians know is just the so-called holy communion as a kind of sacrament and form.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO GO FORWARD</H2><P>Many Christians, after their conversion at the cross, enjoyed Christ for a time, but then gradually went back to the world. They wouldn't go on. They wouldn't go forward. This is where the Lord's recovery is needed. To go forward to enter into the tabernacle means to enter into God's expression. This matter of going on has been mostly lost among Christians. As long as you remain outside of the tabernacle God has no expression. You have to get into the tabernacle to have God's expression. The cross is not God's expression. The cross is just an usher to bring you into God's tabernacle, God's expression. Today very few Christians who have enjoyed the cross of Christ would go on and go forward to enter into God's expression. The expression has been lost. This is why there is the need of the recovery. God's expression should be recovered to you. That means you should go on from the cross into the tabernacle, into the expression of God.</P><P>Once we go forward into the tabernacle we will reach the showbread table which has the heavenly bread, the bread of life. On the showbread table are many rows of bread, signifying Christ as our life and life supply.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Concerning the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
