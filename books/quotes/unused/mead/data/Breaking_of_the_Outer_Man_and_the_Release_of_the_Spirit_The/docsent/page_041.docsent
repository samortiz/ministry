   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The self that was previously hidden now will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The self that was removed from our consciousness now will be clearly felt.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everything will be clear, and we will realize that the self actually involves so much, including activities so numerous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thought that many things were done in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we will see that in essence they are all of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we see this, we will spontaneously condemn the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The things that we see under the light will be condemned by us when they surface again.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we have seen under the light will be rejected by us again when things, words, or intentions of a similar nature arise a second time; we immediately will see that what we are faced with is the same thing that we were trying to deal with the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Anything that has passed through the judgment of light once will be judged again as soon as a little seed sprouts forth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After we have received this shining we will be able to divide the soul from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before this shining, all we had were doctrines, and we spoke like a sinner glibly talking about his own sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not have the light, even our effort to deal with ourselves is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only kind of dealing that is useful is the dealing under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we live before the Lord in this way, our spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will become pure, and the Lord will not have any trouble using us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The dividing of the soul and the spirit comes from the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the shining?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May the Lord be merciful to us to show us what the shining is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Shining is seeing what God sees.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What does God see?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He sees what we do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What do we not see?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not see the things that are of ourselves, the things that we think are of God but which are not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Light shows us how much of what we thought was of God is actually of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It shows us how much of what we thought was good is actually not good, how much of what we thought was right is actually wrong, how much of what we thought was spiritual is actually soulish, and how much of what we thought was of God is actually of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we will say, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now I know myself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am a blind man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have been blind for twenty or thirty years, yet I have not realized it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I did not see what You have seen."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This seeing will take away what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our seeing is the dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not think that seeing is one thing and dealing another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's word is operative.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once His word shines on us, our outer man is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not hear God's word and then gradually experience the dealing afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not see something through God's light and then deal with what we have seen afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not have seeing as one step and dealing as another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The shining is the removing; both happen at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As soon as the light shines, the flesh dies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No flesh survives when it is exposed to the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a man sees light, he does not have to humble himself; he will fall on his face immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Under the light his flesh will wilt away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, this is what it means to be operative.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's word is living and operative.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This does not mean that God speaks, and then we make it operative.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word itself is operative in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May the Lord open our eyes to see these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, we have the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, we have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two things combined together will deal with our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we will put ourselves under His light, and may this light shine on us so that we will prostrate ourselves and say to the Lord, "I am indeed foolish and blind.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I have been so foolish and blind that for years I have taken what is of myself to be of You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Lord, be merciful to me!"</S>
