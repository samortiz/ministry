<h2 class="head2">A. A Transfer of Priesthood</h2><h2 class="head3">1. From the Order of Aaron<br />to the Order of Melchisedec</h2><p>In verse 12 we are told that the priesthood has been transferred. It has firstly been transferred from the order of Aaron to the order of Melchisedec (vv. 11, 15, 17). In the old covenant, the priesthood was according to the order of Aaron, which was often interrupted by death. In the new covenant, the priesthood has been transferred to the order of Melchisedec, which is perpetual.</p><h2 class="head3">2. From the Priestly Tribe of Levi<br />to the Kingly Tribe of Judah</h2><p>The priesthood has also been transferred from the priestly tribe of Levi to the kingly tribe of Judah (vv. 13-14). In the Old Testament, Levi was the tribe of the priests and Judah was the tribe of the kings. The Lord&rsquo;s descending from the tribe of Judah caused a transfer in the priesthood and combined the priesthood together with the kingship in one tribe (Zech. 6:13), as manifested in Melchisedec who was both the high priest and the king (v. 1).</p><h2 class="head3">3. From Men to the Son of God</h2><p>Verse 28 indicates that the priesthood has also been transferred from men to the Son of God. All the men who were priests in the Old Testament were fragile, subject to death, but the Son of God is eternal, living forever. He is the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son of God as the very life that constitutes the priesthood of the new covenant. The priesthood has been transferred from men to such a One, to the Only Begotten Son and the Firstborn Son of God. In such a One we have divinity incarnated and humanity uplifted. In such a One we have human living, the all-inclusive death, and the resurrection. In such a One we have the divine birth of the Firstborn Son of God, the birth that produced the many sons of God. In the new covenant, the priesthood has been transferred to such a One.</p><h2 class="head3">4. A Transfer of Law Needed</h2><p>Verse 12 says, &ldquo;For the priesthood being transferred, there is of necessity a transfer of law also.&rdquo; With the priesthood of the old covenant, there was an old law. Now, with the priesthood of the new covenant, there should be a new law. So a transfer of law is needed.</p><h2 class="head4">a. From the Law of Letters to the Law of Life</h2><p>This transfer of law is from the law of letters to the law of life, according to which Christ has been constituted a living and perpetual High Priest (v. 16). Christ has not been constituted High Priest according to the law of letters but according to the power of an indestructible life. The priesthood of Christ in the new covenant is not a matter of letters but of life. Christ as our High Priest takes care of us now with His indestructible life. Nevertheless, many Christians still want to go back to the law of letters on the other side of the river. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have crossed the river from the other side, the side of letters, to this side, the side of life. It is in this indestructible, eternal life that we participate in and enjoy the priesthood of Christ today.</p><h2 class="head4">b. From the Weak and Unprofitable Commandment<br />to a Better Hope</h2><p>Verses 18 and 19 say, &ldquo;For there is indeed a disannulling of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, (for the law perfected nothing), and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.&rdquo; The commandment, or the regulations, of the law concerning the Levitical priesthood has been disannulled because of its weakness in letters. It was not a matter of life but a dead commandment in letters; so it was unprofitable. Due to the weakness of man, the law perfected nothing (Rom. 8:3).</p><p>The transfer of law annuls the old law and brings in a better hope. What is this better hope? It is the priesthood in life. This hope mainly depends upon life, the indestructible life. Because the priesthood that takes care of us is in such a life, we are full of hope. When you feel weak and consider that feeling as a lie, it indicates that you are full of hope. If your wife tells you that you are weak, you need to say, &ldquo;That is a lie. Dear wife, wait awhile. I&rsquo;ll be a strong fighter just like Abraham. I am full of hope because of the priesthood of my Melchisedec.&rdquo; If you say this, it means that you are full of a better hope. This better hope is the priesthood in life. As long as there is life, there is hope. Only a dead person has no hope. As long as we are alive, there is a certain amount of hope. The transfer of law annuls the dead letters and brings in the hope in life. Never be disappointed&mdash;we have a better hope. We have a priesthood of the indestructible life.</p><p>A number of times people have said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we never see that you are troubled. Don&rsquo;t you have any trials or troubles in your Christian life?&rdquo; I have at least as many troubles as anyone else. The only difference is that I do not believe in my troubles. I believe in my hope. There is a better hope in me. We all have such a hope because the law according to which the priesthood that takes care of us is constituted, has been transferred from the weak and unprofitable commandment to an indestructible life.</p>
