   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is the last lesson on the vision concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The last twelve lessons will cover how to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The topic of this lesson is concerning the consummation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everything has a beginning and a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without a good consummation, nothing is properly concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a wonderful and marvelous church must have a matching consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The consummation of the church will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today the church is a miniature of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The proper church life in its genuineness is a small model of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The crucial matter here, however, is that the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of all of God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, perfected, and glorified people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Jerusalem will be the totality of God's work in both the old creation and in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, God created the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the old creation became fallen, God was prepared to deal with that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He came to be a man, a God-man, a man with divinity mingled with humanity, to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This God-man could redeem sinners, dying for them, because He had the blood to shed for them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This blood is called "His own blood'' Acts 20:28 and "the blood of Jesus His Son'' 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through His all-inclusive death, the Lord released His resurrection life, and with this life He produced, sanctified, transformed, built, and glorified the people whom He had predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The totality of this work, its ultimate consummation, will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of being a material city, the New Jerusalem is a symbol of the totality of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I. ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH ARE PRODUCED IN THE CHURCH AGE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the members of the church are produced in the church age, that is, in the age between Christ's first coming and His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The members of the church are those who were fallen sinners and who have been saved by the grace of God Eph 2:8 through their God-given and God-allotted faith 2 Pet 1:1 , which has brought them into an organic union with the Triune God in Christ 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These members of the church have been forgiven of their sins Acts 10:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have been justified by God in Christ Acts 13:39; 1 Cor 6:11 , and they have been reconciled to God Rom 5:10 , so they have been redeemed back to God Rev 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Based upon this, the members of the church have been regenerated in their spirit by the Spirit of God John 3:6 to be the children of God unto the divine sonship John 1:12-13; Rom 8:16 and to be the members of Christ Eph 5:30 unto His stature Eph 4:13 to be His fullness Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE NEW TESTAMENT OVERCOMERS ARE ALSO PERFECTED IN THE CHURCH AGE A. The Perfection of the New Testament Overcomers in the Church Age</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Testament overcomers are not only produced in the church age but are also perfected in the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The perfecting of the New Testament overcomers is a matter of transformation through the subjective experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.''</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be transformed is to have Christ added into our being to replace what we are so that Christ may increase and our natural life may decrease.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the process of transformation takes place within us, the old element of our natural being is carried away, and the glory, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is added into us to replace the natural element.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is through such a process that the New Testament overcomers are perfected in this age.</S>
