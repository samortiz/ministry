   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S CUP AND HIS BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Mark 10:38 the Lord said to James and John, You do not know what you are asking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both the cup and the baptism refer to the Slave-Savior s death John 18:11; Luke 12:50 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The cup signifies that His death was the God-given portion for Him to take for the sinners whom He would redeem for God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Baptism denotes that His death was the God-ordained way for Him to pass through for the accomplishment of God s redemption for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the Lord s answer we see that those who would sit at the Lord s right and left in His glory must be prepared to drink the cup of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To suffer the cross is the way to enter into the kingdom Acts 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The selfish entreaty of John and James afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way to enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When James and John told the Lord that they were able to drink His cup and be baptized with His baptism, He said to them, The cup which I drink you shall drink; and the baptism with which I am baptized, you shall be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But to sit on My right or on My left is not Mine to give, but for those for whom it has been prepared vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>39-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that the Lord stood in the position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Standing in such a position, the Lord was fully subject to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not assume the right to do anything outside the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE WAY INTO THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The ten were indignant about James and John v. 41 . Then, calling them all to Him, the Lord said to them, You know that those who presume to rule the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But it is not so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And whoever wants to be first among you shall be slave of all vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>42-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord s word here is absolutely contrary to the natural self-seeking mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The indignation of the ten also afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal the way into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way is to be willing to serve others as a servant, even as a slave, instead of ruling over them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE SLAVE OF GOD SERVING SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 45 the Lord goes on to say, For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the strongest expression, stating that the Slave-Savior, as the Son of Man in His humanity, is a Slave of God to serve sinners even with His life, His soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, the word ransom here indicates that even the Slave-Savior s redemption was His service rendered to sinners for God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BLIND BEGGARS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we shall see more fully in the next message, in making their request James and John were actually blind sons of Timaeus, blind beggars v. 46 . Their word about sitting at the Lord s right and left in His glory was a word spoken by those who were blind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may even say that James and John were actually blind beggars.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter ten we see them begging for a position at the Lord s right and left.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is significant, therefore, that this chapter closes with the healing of blind Bartimaeus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>James and John certainly needed such a healing themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As blind men begging for position, they needed the Lord to open their eyes so that they could see Him and see His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to learn from Mark 10 that if we are still ambitious for a position in the church life, we also are sons of Timaeus, poor, blind beggars needing the Lord s healing.</S>
