   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Edom and Philistia</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Like Ammon and Moab, Edom was also closely related to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Edom was the son of Esau, the brother of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, according to blood, Edom and the sons of Israel were cousins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the meaning of Edom?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Edom signifies the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Edom signifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our unregenerated old man is Edom and our regenerated new man is Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the record of Ezekiel, Edom was full of hatred toward Israel, continually seeking revenge and vengeance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our old man hates the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may say, "I love the church."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that you do love the church, but sometimes you also hate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you not discovered that you are two men?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand you are a real Israelite loving the church, and on the other hand you are a real Edomite hating the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes you love the church and you love all the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At other times you hate the church and you hate all the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You do have the nature of Edom within you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Along with Edom is Philistia.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to know the Philistines, we must study Judges and 1 Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Philistines were even closer to Israel than the Edomites.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They lived very close to the good land and even mingled with the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times the Philistines came to the people of Israel and intervened in their worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the ark was captured by the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Philistines typify you and me as the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have the old man, and we also have the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The natural man is more difficult to recognize than the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let me illustrate the difference between the natural man and the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose that there are three elders in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They all love the Lord, but when one of them becomes the leading one, the other two brothers react.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their reaction is an expression of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What about the natural man?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The natural man may be illustrated in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once a brother becomes the leading elder, he would endeavor to do many things for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He would exercise his wisdom, his human power, and his capabilities.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He would play politics, maneuver situations and exercise control to work things out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The elders' meetings become simply a meeting of the old man with the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This damages the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of the churches can hardly go on because they are frustrated by the old man and the natural man of the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not afraid of the Ammonites.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are a little afraid of the Moabites.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But our real concern today is the Edomites and Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Edomites and the Philistines do the most damage to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Tyrus and Zidon</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Tyrus typifies people who are seeking worldly wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are seeking to be rich and to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They will sacrifice everything related to the Lord for the sake of their business.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They do not care for the Lord's interests; they only care for their wealth, their riches, and their business.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>People of Tyrus may be found among unbelievers and also among believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some of your relatives, your cousins, your in-laws, your classmates, and your friends are people of Tyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you talk to them concerning the church, the Lord's testimony, or Christ, they cannot understand what you are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They only want to know if this will help them make a better living and help them become richer or get a higher degree or a higher position.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many of the Jewish people today are endeavoring for these two things: position and wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One Jewish person told me it is better to have both a degree and wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are the people of Tyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some real Christians are also people of Tyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you speak to them concerning the Lord's recovery, they think you are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They think you spend too much time going to the meetings, too much time fellowshipping, and too much time reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They think you do not care enough for your degree, for your business, and for your money.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means they also are people of Tyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Tyrus said Jerusalem was going to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They were happy that Jerusalem was going to fall 26:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the people who are seeking the world's wealth would be happy to see the church terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They would be happy if the meeting hall doors were permanently closed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They would tell you that you are wasting your time going to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Perhaps even among the local churches today, there are some with this attitude who attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They feel they need to study and get a higher degree and that they need to make more money.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They do not care for the church or the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They only care for riches, for wealth, for a position, and for their business.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When they hear of some who backslide, they are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Along with Tyrus is Zidon.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Ezekiel says that Zidon was a pricking brier and a grieving thorn to the house of Israel 28:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After Tyrus comes Zidon, the brier that pricks and grieves.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Matthew 13:22 Jesus said that the deceitfulness of riches and the cares of this world are like thorns which choke the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If Tyrus is present, Zidon is close by.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If many among the saints are of Tyrus, many of Zidon will also come out.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This means if the saints are loving the world and riches, they will become briers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many Christians today have simply become briers and thorns which prick and grieve and damage the church life.</S>
