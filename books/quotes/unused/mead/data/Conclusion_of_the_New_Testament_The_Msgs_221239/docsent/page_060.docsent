   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. The Universal and Local Aspects of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The truth concerning the universal and local aspects of the church also needs to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a very real sense, these matters have been lost, even annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we need to be recovered to the truth concerning these two aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the universal aspect the church is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This aspect of the church is revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16:18, where He says, "On this rock I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is revealed here is the universal church for the unique testimony of the Lord in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 16:18 the Lord says that He will build His church upon "this rock," which refers not only to Christ Himself but also to the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The building up of the universal church is altogether on the clear revelation concerning Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This revelation is the crucial factor, the very center, of the building up of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 18:17 the Lord Jesus reveals the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church mentioned in this verse must be a local church because it is a place where we can go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot bring a problem to the universal church, only to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the local aspect the church is expressed in many localities as many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The one universal church expressed in many places on earth becomes the many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The expression of the church in a locality is the local church in that particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the local churches there would be no practicality and actuality of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The universal church is realized in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 1:2, where Paul addresses "the church of God which is in Corinth," we have both the universal and the local aspects of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is of God, for it is constituted of the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the church which is of God is also local.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we have here both the universal aspect and the local aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The universal aspect refers to the constitution, nature, and content of the church, whereas the local aspect refers to the expression and practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have only the local aspect but not the aspect of the church being of God, we shall have only an outward formality, not the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if we have only the universal aspect but not the local aspect of the church in a particular locality, we shall have the reality but not the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, the church is constituted of God; on the other hand, the church is expressed in a particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The universal church is expressed and practiced in particular localities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To Build the Body of Christ, the Temple of God, the House of God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the recovery of the church, we are building the Body of Christ, the temple of God, the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was typified by the rebuilding of the temple under the leadership of Ezra in Old Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we are rebuilding the church life as God's temple, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 4:12-17 has much to say about the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 12 says, "For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse "unto" means for the purpose of, for, with a view to.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The many gifted persons in verse 11 have only one ministry, that of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the unique ministry in the New Testament economy 2 Cor 4:1; 1 Tim 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, according to the grammatical construction of verse 12, "the building up of the Body of Christ" is "the work of ministry."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever the gifted persons in verse 11 do as the work of ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The four special gifts in verse 11 the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers do not build the Body of Christ directly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, these special gifts perfect the saints that they may build the Body of Christ directly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers perfect, equip, the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that they build up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then the perfected saints become the building members to build the Body of Christ directly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From this we see that the Body is not built directly by the special gifts but by all the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we realize this, we shall avoid the great heresy of the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the church there is no clergy or laity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the contrary, in the church every member of the Body functions to build up the Body of Christ directly.</S>
