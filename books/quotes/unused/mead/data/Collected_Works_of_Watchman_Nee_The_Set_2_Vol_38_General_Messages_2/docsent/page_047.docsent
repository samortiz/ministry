   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Adding One's Own Thoughts</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many words are greatly twisted after they pass through a few mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A word may pass from one man to another and then to a third and so on.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Three or four mouths will turn the word into something totally different from what it was originally.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is because everyone wants to add his own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When one adds a little and another adds a little more, the whole thing eventually becomes completely distorted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When one person conveys something to another and does not speak according to the facts, adding some of his own thoughts into the speaking, he is lying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, when we report something, we have to learn to speak before the Lord according to the facts and not put in our own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we want to speak our own thoughts, we should clarify that this is our opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should separate our opinions from the facts and not mix them together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Otherwise, we are lying.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you want to test a brother's heart before the Lord, all you have to do is tell him something and ask him to pass it on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You can easily find out how his heart is before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person who fears the Lord, who has learned the lesson, and who has been dealt with by the Lord considers speaking to be a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will not dare speak rashly or pass on things lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He will always try to speak accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person who has never been dealt with by the Lord and who has never been disciplined will pass on words enthusiastically.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way he relays the words will expose him as a flippant, vain, and dishonest person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As he passes words around, he adds his own words and says many things that should not be said.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of person can never preach God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He cannot study the Bible properly, because God's Word is accurate to the last iota and serif Matt 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person who is careless will surely make mistakes concerning God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exaggerations</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another common lie is exaggeration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Exaggerations are manifested in inaccurate numbers or in the use of exaggerated words or expressions that are not true.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are lies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes a person likes to magnify the mistakes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A person may be wrong thirty percent, but those who exaggerate will say that it is fifty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the same time these ones try their best to speak lightly of their own mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is also to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After a man is saved, his speaking has to be severely disciplined by the Lord before he can become an honest person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me say a strong word to all of you: A man must reject lies again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time there are inaccurate words, he has to reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He may need to reject them for three to five years before he can be an honest person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A man who is careless in his speech cannot be honest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A common fault with many people is their lies; they speak inaccurate words.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need for a person to learn to lie.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As soon as a child is able to talk, he lies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wise and foolish men alike lie; the only difference is that some are more skillful at lying, while others are less skillful at lying.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But whether or not they are skillful, it is lying just the same.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since lying is so common, we have to learn to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever there is a lie or we touch a spirit of lying, we should be aware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>IDLE WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second, we cannot speak idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Matthew 12:35-37 says, "The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 33 the Lord Jesus says, "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Following this, He describes the way man speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This proves that the fruit spoken of here is not man's conduct but his words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the fruit is good, it proves that the tree is good, and if the fruit is bad, it proves that the tree is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a man is good, his words will surely be good, and if a man is evil, his words will surely be evil.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some people gossip, criticize, slander, and tear down others with their words all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They say all kinds of unclean, filthy, and evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This clearly proves that the tree is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God's children have such faults in themselves, it is impossible for them to help others overcome the same faults.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If some brothers and sisters spread unhealthy, filthy, or sinful things all the time, there is no need to ask whether the things are true or false; the very spreading is in itself unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A man's words are his fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One cannot find a man with a pure heart spreading filthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Nor can one find a man with a loving heart spreading hate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The fruit proves the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not a matter of being true or false.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A person may be speaking facts, definite facts, but the facts should not have come out of his mouth in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The facts may be true, but they are not words that one should say.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The issue is not whether something is true or false but whether or not one should say it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It may not be a lie; it may be a fact, yet as long as it is an idle word, we should not speak it, and we need not speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord said, "Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment" v. 36 . Brothers and sisters, idle words spoken by a Christian are not over once they are spoken; they will be repeated again a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today you may have spoken something rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But one day, you will have to say the same thing again before the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you say it the second time, you will be justified or condemned according to your word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, God's children should learn to fear the Lord and reject all inaccurate and idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A word that does not edify oneself or others should not be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whether or not a man has been dealt with by the Lord can be seen from the words he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those who have been dealt with by God have their mouths checked.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who lie and speak idle, careless words are of little use to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The only thing they can do is wait for the judgment to come.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Those who speak filthy words are surely filthy in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who speak corrupting words are surely corrupt in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The kind of words you speak proves the kind of person that you are.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>One tells the tree by its fruit, and one tells a person by his words.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>From the day we are saved, we should learn to be dealt with by the Lord in our speaking.</S>
