<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Believers Being Joined<br>to the Lord as One Spirit</H2><P>The believers are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. The Believers Being the Branches of Christ<br>as the Vine Tree, the Organism of the Triune God,<br>to Express the Processed Triune God<br>in Bearing Fruit for the Increase of Christ</H2><P>The believers are the branches of Christ as the vine tree, the organism of the Triune God, to express the processed Triune God in bearing fruit for the increase of Christ (John 15:1-5, 8, 16). As the branches of Christ, the believers should live a fruit-bearing life for Christ's increase.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. The Believers Being<br>God's New Testament Priests of His Gospel<br>to Offer the Saved Sinners<br>as Sacrifices to God</H2><P>The believers are God's New Testament priests of His gospel to offer the saved sinners as sacrifices to God (Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9). As the priests of God, the believers should have a sinner-saving service for offering sacrifices to God.</P>
