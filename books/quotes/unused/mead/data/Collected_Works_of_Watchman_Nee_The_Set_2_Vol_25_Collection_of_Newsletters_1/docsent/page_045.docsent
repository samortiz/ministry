   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Recent Persecution</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a town near here called Tun Shan Ma.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is about thirteen or fourteen miles away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are more than twenty brothers and sisters there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The people there are very wild.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their knowledge and mentality are very crude.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they hear that someone has believed in the Lord and does not burn paper money or incense and does not do other types of superstitious things, they are very surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, the believers do not associate much with the unbelievers, so the believers' relatives and neighbors are not happy and have become antagonistic toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They see the believers meeting morning and evening, and they are jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They often exhibit an opposing attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first month of this spring, I Chen Yung K'uan and Brother Chi Yung Tung went there to visit the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We met in a brother's house in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Chi had prepared a small message for that time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We had just started when suddenly many people who looked very wild and mean showed up outside.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One person came inside and grabbed Brother Ma Shang Feng's Bible out of his hand; then many people began shouting, "Beat him, beat him; drag Ma Shang Feng out and beat him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These people were Brother Shang Feng's family.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then they took Brother Chi's book bag, the hymns which were hanging on the walls, and a few hymnals, etc., and burned them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that time some Gentiles who were listening to the Word were stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did not agree with this disturbance, and they began to fight with the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Chi and I could only bow our heads and pray as we saw this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We gave ourselves to the Lord and quietly exhorted the nearby brothers and sisters to endure by relying on the Lord and to not be provoked.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time there were more than twenty brothers and sisters in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With the exception of a few new believers who were weaker and got excited, the rest were very quiet and did not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They waited to see what God would have them to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The mob wanted to set fire to the house we were meeting in. Later they were stopped by the elders of the town and eventually did nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They rioted for two hours before they began to disperse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we were taken home by Brother Yao to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One person was injured one of the opposers that evening.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The injured man said that we hit him, and he wanted to force Brother Ma Shang Feng to pay his medical expenses and give him a gift of reparation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Brother Ma did not, he was going to take our brother to the county seat and sue him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The next day, after the townspeople helped settle the case, our brother promised to pay him according to the teaching in Matthew 5:39-42, and finally the injured opposer stopped threatening.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, since this episode, the unbelievers in the town still slander the Lord's name and shame and oppose our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They want to stop them from meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On February 7, we had an edification meeting for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Chiu Jih Chien was responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was a Sister Ma there Shang Feng's cousin who brought a Sister T'ang to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This sister is already married.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Her husband's last name is Chen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now she is staying in her mother's house and is a neighbor of Sister Ma.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They had traveled half-way to the meeting when Sister T'ang's older brother was asked about this matter by his sister's mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He brought a stick and pursued them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He began beating his sister with the stick.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sister Ma was standing beside them and said a few words of exhortation to the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She was also beaten two times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sister Ma was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>She knew how to endure for the Lord and still came to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Poor Sister T'ang was taken home by her brother and sent to her husband's house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, her brother and parents-in-law decided to stop her from meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The road from Tun Shan Ma to Chen Chia Yueh Tze goes through a town that our brothers and sisters must pass through on their way to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the people of that town see the brothers and sisters coming to the meeting, they slander them with all kinds of words.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, they sometimes push the sisters into the river.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Oh, we really see Satan's special work in attacking our brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But we also see the Lord's victory in protecting them in all these situations and manifesting His strength and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although a sudden storm has arisen on the sea, we thank the almighty Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He can calm the wind and the waves Matt 8:23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now the persecution and opposition have temporarily stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although the brothers and sisters have passed through many storms, they have learned much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Their faith has not been weakened; on the contrary, their strength and boldness have been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since passing through persecution, they have not only continued meeting but also are more diligent to come.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Their hymn is, "I praise You for what went before.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I trust in You for what is to come."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>May the brothers and sisters who love the Lord faithfully remember to pray before God for the church in Chen Chia Yueh Tze and the brothers and sisters in Tun Shan Ma, asking the Lord to protect us until He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Your small brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Chen Yung K'uan and Hsu Chin Yun</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>April 23, 1934</S>
