This is the central point of this series of messages. We have used this term union quite much, but concerning the union of God and man, we do not have adequate knowledge. The union of God and man is altogether a matter of the union of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. God is Spirit and man has a spirit; thus, these two spirits can be united together as one. But how does the union of these two spirits occur? This is the deepest mystery in the Bible, and it is difficult for man to comprehend.</P><P>The Bible in total has sixty-six books. The first thirty-nine books are the Old Testament, which has nothing to do with the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. In the New Testament the four Gospels record the greatest thing that ever happened in the universe, that is, God coming to be a man. After God created man, for a period of four thousand years, besides speaking some prophecies and presenting some types, He did not do anything as far as the union of God and man is concerned. It was at the beginning of the New Testament that He did a great thing, that is, He was begotten in the womb of a virgin and remained there for nine months. This begetting is the union of God and man. It is also the joining and mingling of God and man. We have a new hymn which says, "What miracle! What mystery!/That God and man should blended be!" This joining and mingling began in the womb of the virgin. God did not merely stay there temporarily but remained there for nine months. Matthew 1:20 says that what was begotten in Mary was of the Holy Spirit. In other words, it was God who was begotten in Mary. He remained there for nine months; then He was born with the human flesh and the human nature. He was God, but He was born to be a man. He was God, but He became in the likeness of a man and was found in fashion as a man (Phil. 2:7-8). In Genesis chapter one God merely created man in His likeness. However, when He came forth from the womb of the virgin Mary, He Himself became in the likeness of a man. When God created man, He created him according to His likeness. When He came forth from the virgin's womb, He became in the likeness of a man.</P><P>God became a man and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. During that time many things took place concerning Him. That was His human living. The four Gospels as the first books of the New Testament specifically speak about God's living on the earth as a man. That is the story of the union of God and man. God was on the earth, yet He was not expressed in the image of God; rather, He was manifested fully in the likeness of man. He lived and walked on the earth in the likeness of man; yet within He was united with God. He was man and also God. From the outside, it appeared that He was merely a man; but in actuality He was God. He was the union of God and man.</P><P>After the four Gospels, from Acts to Revelation there are a total of twenty-three books, all of which present the story of the union of God and the believers. The union of God and man, causing the two to be one, is a matter that is most difficult to study and understand in the Bible. Hence, the portions of the Bible that speak of this union are also the most difficult to translate. To translate the Gospels is relatively easy, but to translate the Epistles is rather difficult because what is spoken of in those twenty-three books are not matters that belong to human culture, but things that had never occurred in human culture. Because of the absence of the culture of the union of God and man, there is a shortage of language to express it. This forced the translators of the Bible to create some new terms. In the ancient Chinese classical writings we cannot find things such as regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Even if they contain similar terms, they refer to matters in the old culture which have nothing to do with the revelation in the Bible concerning the union of God and man.</P><P>We common and sinful men are made God through the six big steps of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Regeneration is the initiation; glorification is the consummation; sanctification, renewing, transformation and conformation are the process between these two ends. The twenty-three books from Acts to Revelation speak of these six big steps. After these six big steps are completed, an issue is produced, which is the holy city, New Jerusalem. This New Jerusalem is the great issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man in these six big steps. In this chapter we will consider these six big steps and the wonderful things that happen in them. All these steps are also what we, the believers, must pass through today.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
