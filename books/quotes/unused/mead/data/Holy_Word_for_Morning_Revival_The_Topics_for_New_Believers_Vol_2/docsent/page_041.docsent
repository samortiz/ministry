   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>259 We need to see that the manifestation of the kingdom is simply the transfer of the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the next age the millennial age , the reality of the kingdom will become the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>260 The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power 24:30 , as unveiled by the King on the Mount of Olives in chapters 24 25.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life Rom 14:17 , which exists in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Father in Matthew 13:43; the earthly part of the millennial kingdom is the Messianic kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Son of Man in 13:41, and which is the restored tabernacle of David, the kingdom of David Acts 15:16 .</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kingdom in its reality...is an exercise and a discipline to us Matt 5:3, 10, 20; 7:21; 18:3 in the church today whereas the kingdom in its manifestation...will be a reward and an enjoyment to us Matt 16:27; 25:21, 23 in the millennial kingdom in the coming age.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The last section of Matthew chapters 24 25 concerns the manifestation of the kingdom when the Lord Jesus will come back to the earth....The two parables on watchfulness and faithfulness in Matthew 25 are very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They show us that, at the manifestation of the kingdom, some of the saints will enter into the joy of the Lord, and others will not.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the parable of the ten virgins watchfulness; vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>1-13 , the five wise virgins will enter into the marriage feast, but the five foolish virgins will be shut out and sent to buy oil.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The servant with one talent missed the joy and also was put into darkness where there was weeping and gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Please do not ask me where this darkness will be and what kind of darkness this will be.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I cannot tell you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I do know that we have such a word out of the Lord s mouth and such a word written in the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>269 We all need to repent and consecrate ourselves to deal with this matter of the kingdom.</S>
