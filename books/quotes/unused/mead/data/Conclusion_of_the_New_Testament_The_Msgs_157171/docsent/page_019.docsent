   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the first preaching of the New Testament gospel people were told to repent because the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near Matt 3:2; 4:17; 10:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This meant that the time had come for God to dispense Himself as life into people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The gospel brings God as life, and this life is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kingdom is the realm of life for life to move, work, rule, and govern so that life may accomplish its purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom as the realm of life is actually the life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The gospel brings in the divine life, and the divine life has its realm.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine life with its realm produces the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the kingdom is the reality of the church, according to the New Testament revelation, we cannot live the church life apart from the proper kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why we have emphasized the fact that the gospel preached at the beginning of the New Testament concerns not salvation but the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To enter the kingdom of God is to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may talk about regeneration without realizing that regeneration is for the entry into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are regenerated into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that regeneration results in the kingdom, for regeneration issues in an entrance into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When God regenerated us, He regenerated us into His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as the kingdom and the church are interrelated, so the kingdom and God's salvation also are interrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not participate in God's kingdom, it will be difficult for us to enjoy His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, we cannot realize the kingdom life unless we receive God's salvation, a salvation that becomes the supply to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The enjoyment of this supply is for us to live a kingdom life in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the content of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that without the reality of the kingdom, the church is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reality of the kingdom is actually Christ Himself as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ as life is the essence, the substance, for us to live a proper life so that in this life we may be built up with other believers to bring in the real church life, which is a glorious expression of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, when Christ is expressed, the entire Triune God is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This expression depends on whether or not the believers live a life that is the reality of the kingdom, a reality that is fully revealed and described in chapters five through seven of the Gospel of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These chapters are a complete message on the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, and this constitution is the reality of the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This reality is the genuine content of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus mentioned the church twice, both times in the Gospel of Matthew, a book that proclaims the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each time the Lord Jesus spoke of the church, He mentioned it in relation to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates how intimately the kingdom and the church are related.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Matthew 16:18 He speaks of the church in a universal way, indicating that the universal church is intimately related to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then in Matthew 18:17 He speaks of the church in the local sense, indicating that the local church is also related to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In particular, the local church is related to our life as brothers in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is proved by the fact that Matthew 18 is concerned with the proper relationship between brothers in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This relationship involves the local church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would have the reality of the kingdom as the content of our church life, we need Christ to be our life and our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through the dispensing of the Triune God into our being, we need to experience and enjoy Christ as our life.</S>
