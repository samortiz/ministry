[1]  GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Heb 1:1-2; Acts 2:42; John 14:10; 5:24; Matt 28:19-20; John 16:12-15; Rev 2:1, 7; 1 Cor 4:17b; 7:17b; 2 Pet 3:15-16; Rev 1:1-2; Matt 1:18-25; Rev 21:1-3, 9-11; Luke 1:30-31, 34-35; Matt 1:18, 20; Heb 2:14a; Acts 10:38; 1:21; 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18; 1 Cor 15:3; 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 6:6; Gal 5:24; John 3:14; Heb 2:14b; John 12:31-33, 24a; Heb 9:12; John 19:34; Matt 16:21b; Acts 2:24; 3:15; 5:30; Rom 4:25b; Acts 13:33; Rom 1:4; 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:29; John 12:24b; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 7:39; Rev 22:17; John 20:17; Lev 23:10-11; Acts 1:9-11; Heb 2:7; Acts 2:36; 5:31; Eph 1:22
[2]  In the universe there is a marvelous matter God s speaking.
[3]  This speaking is not concerning baptism, head covering, foot-washing, or the Lord s table; it is concerning God s New Testament economy.
[4]  The New Testament reveals that Christ s ascension had two parts, the secret part and the open part.
[5]  Most readers of the Scriptures have not realized that there was a secret part to Christ s ascension.
[6]  Before His coming beck to the disciples, He did not allow anyone to touch Him, because the freshness of His resurrection should be presented to the Father for the Father s satisfaction, that God might taste His freshness in resurrection.
[7]  The open part of Christ s ascension was for Christ to be crowned with glory and honor Heb 2:7 , to be made both Lord and Christ Acts 2:36 , to be made a Leader and Savior Acts 5:31 , and to be made Head over all things to the church Eph 1:22 .
[8]  The first four basic steps of God s plan include incarnation, the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the ascension of Christ.
[9]  OF ALL THE BELIEVERS INTO ONE BODY 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:1-4, 17a, 18a, 33; 1:5b, 8a; 10:44-46; 11:15-16; 1 Cor 12:13; Acts 10:47-48; 2:38, 41; 16:33; 19:5; Matt 28:19; Gal 3:27-28; Eph 1:23; 5:23b; Rev 19:7, 9; John 3:29-30; Gen 2:20b-23; Eph 5:24-25, 31-32; Rev 21:2, 9-10; Eph 2:15-16; 4:22-24; Col 3:9-11
[10]  After the ascension of Christ, the Holy Spirit was poured out for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body Acts 2:1-4, 17a, 18a, 33; 1:5b, 8a; 10:44-46; 11:15-16; 1 Cor 12:13 , making the believers the Body of Christ, having Christ as the Head Eph 1:22-23; 5:23b , and making them the bride of Christ Rev 19:7, 9 and the universal new man Col 3:10; Eph 4:24 .
[11]  In the incarnation of the Triune God, God was born in a virgin Matt 1:18, 20 so that He could partake of man s blood and flesh in order to bring God into man that He might mingle Himself with man and pass through human living.
[12]  First, the resurrection of Christ testifies that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God in Him and with Him Rom 4:25b .
[13]  All the believers were baptized into one Body in order that they might be the Body of Christ having Christ as the Head Eph 1:23; 5:23b .
[14]  The Body is the fullness of Christ, the One who fills all in all.
[15]  Therefore, the church as the Body of Christ is Christ s full growth and Christ s rich surplus.
[16]  The temple of God is where God as the Spirit dwells and where we as His people worship Him.
[17]  Whether universal or local, all of these temples are God s habitation, God s dwelling place.
[18]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You and thank You for this blessed hour in which You have called us into Your name.
[19]  Lord, at least You have gained us; we are one with You on this earth to testify of You, to tell the whole universe that God is the very God, the very Lord of the entire universe, not only in the heavens but also on earth.
[20]  The kingdom of God as the realm of God s governmental administration also has a particular section which is the kingdom of God in the New Testament age, that is, in God s New Testament economy.
[21]  This is why in John 3 the Lord Jesus told us that if we desire to enter into the New Testament section of the kingdom of God, we must be reborn, or regenerated vv.
[22]  The seed of life, which is God Himself, not only produces the kingdom of God; it grows to be the kingdom of God.
[23]  Just as the kingdom of lions is the lions themselves, and the kingdom of vegetables is the vegetables themselves, so the kingdom of God is God Himself growing in us.
[24]  In Luke 17 the Pharisees questioned the Lord Jesus as to when the kingdom of God would come.
[25]  He answered them, The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Look, here!
[26]  For behold, the kingdom of God is among you vv.
[27]  Mark 1:14-15 says, And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near.
[28]  On the one hand, the Body formed on the day of Pentecost by the outpouring of the Spirit is the church of God, and on the other hand, this church of God is also the kingdom of God.
[29]  In fact, the book of Acts closes with his testifying of the kingdom of God Acts 28:23 and proclaiming the kingdom of God Acts 28:31 .
[30]  The church of God refers to the believers life and right 1 Cor 1:2; 10:32 .
[31]  OF ALL THE BELIEVERS INTO ONE BODY 4 Scripture Reading: Matt 3:2; 5:3,10; Mark 1:15; Matt 13:24; Mark 4:26; Dan 4:26; Matt 5:20-45, 48; 6:10; 16:18-19; 13:24-26, 28, 30, 33; 1 Cor 5:6, 8; Matt 16:6, 11-12; Rev 2:20, 24b; Matt 24:33, 39, 42-44; 25:6, 19; Rev 20:4-6; 2:26-27; 12:5a; Matt 19:28; 24:45-47; 25:21-23; 2 Tim 2:12a; 4:18b; 2 Pet 1:11; 1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:4-5
[32]  Prayer: Lord, we worship and thank You that You have gathered us into Yourself, into Your name, around Your word.
[33]  The kingdom of the heavens is the realm of God s heavenly rule in the New Testament believers in Christ cf.
[34]  However, some teachers of the Bible, most notably those among the Brethren, have taught that, because the Jews rejected the kingdom when it was offered to them by the Lord Jesus, the kingdom of the heavens was suspended, and the church age came in to replace the kingdom.
[35]  In ancient times, the Jewish people wore a long gown with a blue band encircling the bottom, signifying that their conduct typified by the garment was under the rule of the heavens signified by the band of blue and reminding them to keep God s commandments Num 15:38-39 .
[36]  The Lord s goal, the Lord s purpose, in saving sinners, dealing with us, disciplining us, and operating in us is the building up of the organic Body of Christ.
[37]  The second item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the mustard herb growing abnormally into a tree Matt 13:31-32 .
[38]  IN HIS ASCENSION 1 Scripture Reading: Mark 16:19; Heb 4:14a; Eph 1:20a-23; Heb 8:1b; Rev 3:21b; Heb 2:7b; Rev 5:1, 6-7; Acts 2:36b; 10:36b; 5:31a; Heb 4:14-15; 7:26; 8:2; Rev 1:5a; Eph 1:22; 5:23a; Matt 3:16; Luke 4:18-19; Mark 16:9a, 19; Acts 2:1-4, 17, 33; Heb 9:28b; 2 Tim 4:1b; John 1:29; Rev 5:5-7
[39]  We have seen that the apostles teaching is the entire speaking of God in the New Testament.
[40]  The items of the apostles teaching that we have seen thus far are the incarnation of the Triune God, the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body.
[41]  These three major items are the ministry of Christ in His ascension, the second coming of Christ, and the rapture of the saints.
[42]  Now we want to go on to see the offices of Christ in His ascension.
[43]  In His ascension He is the Christ Acts 2:36b .
[44]  As the Christ, He has been commissioned and appointed by God to carry out God s eternal plan, His eternal economy.
[45]  As the Lamb in His earthly ministry, Christ accomplished God s full redemption for us by being slain on the cross to die the all-inclusive death according to God s requirements of righteousness, holiness, and glory.
[46]  In the last message, we saw Christ s position in His ascension and the offices of Christ in His ascension.
[47]  We also saw that the heavenly ministry of Christ is the continuation and complement of His earthly ministry.
[48]  Now in the heavens, Christ is ministering, and His ministry in the heavens today is for His church and His believers.
[49]  In His ascension Christ is the Mediator, the Executor, of the new covenant Heb 8:6 .
[50]  First John 2:1b reveals that Christ is our Advocate to take care of our case before God.
[51]  Christ as a Minister of the true heavenly tabernacle, ministers heaven which is not only a place, but also a condition of life into us, that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth as He did while He was here.
[52]  After fellowshipping concerning the ministry of Christ in His ascension in messages six and seven, we now come to the rapture of the saints.
[53]  The Brethren, who were raised up in England in the early part of the nineteenth century, and G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton all rendered us much help concerning the Lord s second coming and the rapture of the saints.
[54]  Then Romans 5:10 says that since we have been reconciled to God through the death of Christ, much more we shall be saved in the life of Christ.
[55]  Now we have to see when the rapture of the saints will take place.
[56]  This redemption, this transfiguration, and this glorification will take place with the coming parousia presence of Christ Matt 24:3 .
[57]  His second coming is the presence of Himself as the most dignified person, and this presence will begin from the throne of God in the third heaven before the great tribulation.
[58]  The rapture of the firstfruit is depicted in Revelation 14:1 and 4.
[59]  They will be raptured before the manifestation of Antichrist and his persecution of the saints Rev 14:9-12 .
[60]  The Lord s prophecy in Matthew 24 and 25 covers all the people of God, signified by the number twelve, which is used several times for the New Jerusalem as the totality of God s redeemed and glorified people.
[61]  Now I would like to present a summary of what we have fellowshipped concerning the rapture of the saints.
[62]  The two strong signs of the Lord s coming and the coming last week of the seventy weeks in Daniel are the restoration of the nation of Israel and the return of Jerusalem to the people of Israel.
[63]  At the beginning of the last week, the last seven years of this age, Antichrist will make an agreement with the nation of Israel to allow them to worship God freely.
[64]  Before this period of tribulation begins, the overcomers represented by the man-child, the firstfruit, the overcomers in Philadelphia, the watchful and beseeching saints, and the watchful one of the two saints will be raptured to the third heaven to God s temple.
[65]  First, Satan will be cast from heaven to the earth to cause, with great rage, woes to the earth and the sea and to persecute God s people, those who still remain on the earth, and he will war with the Jews, who keep the commandments of God, and the believers, who have the testimony of Jesus Rev 12:7, 12b-13, 17 .
[66]  THE CONTENTS OF THE SEVENTH SEAL The First Four Trumpets
[67]  The first trumpet will be God s judgment on the earth: hail and fire mingled with blood will be cast to the earth; the third of the earth, the third of the trees, and all the green grass will be burnt Rev 8:7 .
[68]  The second trumpet will be God s judgment on the sea: a great mountain burning with fire will be cast into the sea; the third part of the sea will become blood, the third part of the living creatures in the sea will die, and the third part of the ships will be destroyed Rev 8:8-9 .
[69]  The third trumpet will be God s judgment on the rivers: a great star, called Wormwood, will fall out of heaven, burning like a torch, and will fall upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters; the third part of the waters will become wormwood, and many men will die from the bitter waters Rev 8:10-11 .
[70]  The fourth trumpet will be God s judgment on the sun, moon, and stars: the third part of the sun, of the moon, and of the stars will be smitten; the third part of the three lights the sun, moon, and stars will be darkened, the day and night not appearing for the third part of them Rev 8:12 .
[71]  Revelation 10:1 through 6 shows us Christ s coming down out of heaven to the air.
[72]  At that juncture He will declare that there should be delay no longer, but in the days of the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, the mystery of God will be finished as the good news God announced to the prophets Rev 10:6-7 .
[73]  After this insertion of Christ s coming down out of heaven to the air, God s plan continues to be carried out with the sounding of the seventh trumpet.
[74]  We have seen that the contents of the seventh trumpet include the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ and the judgment of the dead.
[75]  The fourth bowl will be God s further judgment on the sun causing it to burn men with fire, and men being burned to blaspheme the name of God Rev 16:8-9 .
[76]  The fifth bowl will be God s ultimate judgment on the kingdom of Antichrist executed on his throne, causing his kingdom to become darkened and his people to gnaw their tongues for pain and blaspheme God for their sores Rev 16:10-11 .
[77]  Hence, God first will destroy the religious and mystical Babylon Rev 14:8 , that is, the apostate Roman Church, by Antichrist at the beginning of the great tribulation when he will break the covenant with Israel Dan 9:27 and begin to persecute all religions Dan 8:11; 2 Thes 2:3-4 .
[78]  CHAPTER TEN THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Matt 24:3, 27, 37, 39; Rev 12:5; 14:1-4; 2 Thes 2:8; Rev 1:7; Matt 24:36-43; Rev 10:1; 1 Thes 4:16-17; Rev 14:14-16; 2 Cor 5:10; 1 Cor 4:5; Matt 25:19; Luke 19:15; Rom 14:10, 12; Rev 11:18b; Luke 14:14; Matt 24:45-47, 50-51; 25:20-46; Luke 19:16-26; Rev 19:7-9; Luke 14:8a; Matt 22:2, 11-14; Zech 12:9; Rev 19:19-21; Matt 24:28; Zech 12:10-14; Rev 19:11-21; 17:14; 14:17-20; Rom 11:26-27; Dan 7:13-14; Luke 19:12; Rev 11:15; 20:4, 6
[79]  It is the entire teaching of the New Testament from the first page of Matthew to the last page of Revelation.
[80]  The apostles teaching concerning God s New Testament economy includes the incarnation of the Triune God; the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ; the resurrection of Jesus Christ; the ascension of Christ; the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all His believers into one Body; the ministry of Christ in His ascension; the rapture of the saints; the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls in relation to the rapture of the saints and the second coming of Christ; the second coming of Christ; the thousand-year kingdom; and the New Jerusalem.
[81]  His first coming was in His incarnation, the incarnation of God.
[82]  Matthew 24:36-43 describes what it will be like during the secret aspect of the Lord s coming in the heavens.
[83]  If we do not have the concept of the secret aspect of His coming, we cannot understand these verses.
[84]  First Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 say, Because the Lord Himself, with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with a trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we who are living, who remain, shall be caught up at the same time together with them in clouds into a meeting of the Lord in the air; and so we shall be always together with the Lord.
[85]  After this rapture of all God s chosen people in both the Old and New Testament times, Christ will judge all the saints at His judgment seat 2 Cor 5:10; 1 Cor 4:5; Matt 25:19; Luke 19:15; Rom 14:10, 12 .
[86]  The third thing the Lord will do during His parousia in the air will be to marry His overcomers Rev 19:7-9 .
[87]  At His judgment seat, He will make clear who the overcomers and the defeated ones are.
[88]  We should remember that on the way of His parousia, Christ will do three things: rapture the majority of the saints, judge all the saints at His judgment seat, and marry His overcomers.
[89]  Revelation 11:15 says that at the Lord s coming back the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ.
[90]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS Scripture Reading: Rev 20:4-6; Matt 24:46-47; 25:19-23; Luke 19:15-19; Rev 2:26-27; 3:21; 2 Tim 2:12a; Matt 13:43; Acts 15:16; 1:6; Matt 13:41; Rev 11:15; 2 Sam 7:13; Rom 11:26-27; Zech 12:10; Ezek.
[91]  In the previous messages, we saw the truth concerning the second coming of Christ.
[92]  In this message we want to see the truth concerning the kingdom of a thousand years revealed in Revelation 20:4-6.
[93]  There are no Old Testament saints in the church age, but in the kingdom of a thousand years, the overcoming Old Testament saints are present with the overcoming New Testament saints.
[94]  Just before the Lord was transfigured on the mount, He told His disciples, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom Matt 16:28 .
[95]  OF THE KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS SHOULD BE
[96]  In 2 Timothy 4:1 Paul told Timothy, I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom.
[97]  This is according to the Lord s promise in Revelation 3:12: He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
[98]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE NEW JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Rev 21:1 22:5, 14-15
[99]  In previous messages we have fellowshipped concerning the rapture of the saints; the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls in relation to the rapture of the saints and the second coming of Christ; the second coming of Christ; and the kingdom of a thousand years.
[100]  If we want to know more of the crucial details concerning the New Jerusalem, I would suggest reading chapters twenty-six through forty-four in the book entitled God s New Testament Economy published by Living Stream Ministry.
[101]  Such a New Jerusalem is the enlargement of God with the divine element, the human element, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the ascension of Christ compounded and mingled together with His chosen, redeemed, transformed, and glorified people.
[102]  That age was to produce the forefathers of the Old Testament saints as a part of God s new creation, signified by the stars on the head of the universal woman the aggregate of God s chosen people in Revelation 12:1.
[103]  The New Jerusalem will be the composition in a smaller scale of all the overcoming and mature saints as a reward to them in the kingdom age Rev 2:7b .
[104]  The New Jerusalem will be the composition of all God s chosen and redeemed people, including all the saved Israelites under God s old covenant and all the believers of God s new covenant, as a common portion to all God s chosen and redeemed people in eternity Rev 21:12-14 .
[105]  This presents a clear view that the entire New Jerusalem is a total composition of the Old Testament saints under God s first covenant and all the New Testament saints under God s second covenant, the new covenant.
[106]  The New Jerusalem is built with the processed Triune God, typified by gold, pearls, and precious stones Rev 21:18-21 .
[107]  These precious materials typify the Triune God in His Trinity.
[108]  Therefore, God s divine nature will be the base as a mountain to hold all God s people built together on it.
[109]  This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life over us to make us precious pearls for the building of God s eternal expression.
[110]  The Spirit works to transform the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God s eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His permeating glory.
[111]  All God s redeemed and transformed people are kings within the city to reign over the new heaven and new earth as the realm of God s eternal kingdom 22:5b .
