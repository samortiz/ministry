It is not only the elders and co-workers who serve, but every brother and sister in the church is a serving one
You should know that time is limited in a training; therefore, after you have prayed a little while, you should begin to pray-read
We can use our eyes to read the Lord's Word, our mind to understand the Lord's Word, and our spirit to pray over and receive the Lord's Word
For several decades we have been trying to overturn this way, but sometimes the more we tried the more we fell back into it
We cannot change the earth, which was created by God, but we can change the method of transportation on the earth
In the first message the emphasis will be on the word, while in the second message the emphasis will be on speaking
In the Chinese Union Version, the translation of 1 Timothy 2:4 is, 'Who will have all men to be saved and know the true principle'
Many Christians pay attention only to 'God desires all men to be saved' and neglect the other part of God's desire
After we are saved, whether or not we will be useful vessels in God's hand depends on our attitude toward the truth
When brothers and sisters stand up to speak in the meetings, we can discern from their speaking the measure of the truth that is in them
Everyone is able to stand up and give a testimony, but when we ask many of the saints to speak the truth, they are not able to do it
How many of you can stand up and speak concisely, clearly, simply, understandably, and thoroughly for five to ten minutes?
If we cannot speak spiritual words, how can we go out to supply life, release the truth, and preach the gospel?
Today if we do not have a considerable amount of education in the truth our service cannot meet the demand of the present age
As a result of the diligent labor of the brothers, the number attending the Chinese-speaking meeting in Anaheim has increased
In this message we have said that God desires all men not only to be saved but also to come to the full knowledge of the truth
They have received the higher education provided by the government, and thus they have become useful and talented people
We cannot put together on the Lord's Day those who were saved thirty years ago and those who are saved today and give them the same message
If we change the system, if there are six hundred people coming to the meeting, we will need six rooms that can each hold one hundred people
If the Lord has mercy on us, in two or three years the large meeting hall can be built; then we can do many things
In the same way, even though we are not well equipped today, having too little space and not enough manpower, we still must do our best
Through God's breathing out and our breathing in, God's word enters into us and becomes our life and life supply
When we read the Bible, we must understand that the Bible is not merely black words on white paper, but it is the breathing out of God
We must not only understand the Bible with our mind, but we also must contact the word of the Bible with our spirit
We human beings are created; we have a body, a soul with thoughts, emotions, desires, and intentions, and a spirit
God cannot simply be the Spirit and enter into our spirit; this is too intangible and impossible for us to understand
He did not know anything concerning the truth and the gospel in the Bible, because he did not believe in the Lord
When we read the Bible, we should not interpret arbitrarily a passage that we do not understand, thus departing from the meaning of the Word
According to Ephesians 5:26, which refers to 'the water in the word,' they say that to be born again one must first hear the word of God
The first is to interpret the Bible with the word of the Bible, and the second is to interpret it according to the context
They merely interpret the Word according to their natural understanding, and consequently they make a serious mistake
If we want to know the Bible, the first thing we must do is to comprehend it literally; then we must pay attention to the context
To comprehend the Word literally we first need to read the black and white letters with our eyes as well as with our mind
At first, we do not need to explain what we read, nor do we need to understand it; we only need to pray-read the Word literally
Even if you pray-read Genesis 3:1-2, 'Now the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made
To pray-read is to receive 'the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition'
Whenever we receive the Word of God by pray-reading, the result is that we eat, drink, and breathe in the Spirit and the life in God's Word
In Hebrews 5:12 we are told that the Word of God is of two kinds: milk for those who are babes, and solid food for those who are mature
It is clear, then, that to pray-read is to eat, to drink, and to breathe, and the more consistently we practice it, the better
We will go beyond the letter, the historical events, and the people and things, and we will obtain the revelation of life
When he reads about Abraham, he may not be able to understand, and he may think, 'Abraham is a holy man seeking after God
Later on he may read about the Israelites coming out of Egypt, entering into Canaan, and destroying the seven tribes in Canaan
Similarly, regarding the matter of circumcision, to require people to be circumcised on the eighth day is merely the letter
Galatians chapter four reveals that Sarah the wife of Abraham represents the covenant of grace whereas Hagar symbolizes the covenant of law
We all must go beyond the historical events and persons in order to see the revelation of life hidden within them
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
We can see that when love comes, this love becomes grace, and when grace comes to us, it comes through fellowship; this is dispensing
Christ, the life-giving Spirit, who is God Himself, comes into our spirit, causing our spirit to have the life of God
He desires to enter into our mind, which is the major part of our soul, so that our soul may have the life of God
In the garden of Gethsemane, the officials of the temple in Jerusalem came with soldiers to find Jesus, the Nazarene
When Peter drew a sword and cut off the ear of the slave of the high priest, the Lord said, 'Put the sword into the sheath'
When the shell dies completely, the inner life's germination will also be completed; thus a tender sprout will grow out
As His outward body was dying, His inner life was germinating , allowing Him to come out of Hades and the tomb
Having passed through the four steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He ascended to the heavens
While He was living the human life it was God who was on the earth when He ascended to the heavens it was a Man who entered into the heavens
To this day no prominent theologian or professor of theology has written a proper book to refute my theological viewpoints
In reading the phrase 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,' the Lord saw the matter of resurrection
Apparently these men are dead, but since God is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, they will be resurrected
It seems that theologians only skate on the ice and are not willing to break the ice and dive into the ocean to explore the depths
Whereas literal comprehension requires that we use our eyes and our mind, we also need to use our spirit to pray-read God's Word
Since it is food, we need to eat it; since it is milk, we need to drink it; and since it is breath, we need to breathe it in
They exhaust their minds to study the letter of the Bible, but they do not use their spirit to pray-read the Word of God
Jesus said to the Pharisees, 'You search the Scriptures and you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life'
To study the Scriptures is one thing, but to come to the Lord by prayer to touch Him and gain His life is totally another matter
He described it so vividly that one person from the congregation stood up quickly and ran to a huge column in the assembly hall
Whitefield's preaching was so powerful that it seemed that he was presenting the lake of fire before the eyes of the congregation
We read the Word with our eyes and comprehend the letters with our mind; then we need to use our spirit to pray-read the Word
By repeating the process of immersing the basket and taking it out of the water eight or ten times, the rice is washed
We have to read the letter, because this is how the Bible is written, and we have to use our mind to comprehend
Paying attention to the context requires much consideration, because there are no specific limits as to the boundary of a passage
A prominent Bible scholar has said that in order to expound a single sentence of the Bible, one needs to use the entire Bible
Chapter eighteen, however, reveals to us that the way to build the church is to gather together into the name of the Lord
Not a great number of saints, but a small number, even two or three, may meet together to recover some brothers
It is just like a lawyer who cannot make a decision on a legal case according to only a single code of the law
A good lawyer is one who not only knows the law in depth but also can assimilate and use it in a comprehensive manner
In general, Bible scholars use the Word of God to explain God's Word; this is to use the Bible to interpret the Bible
Peter 1:23 says, 'Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
It is not wrong to expound the Word literally, but it must be done not in a natural way or according to human concepts
You should go to the entire Bible to see what is said concerning this sentence; that is to use the words of the Bible to expound the Word
We must see how the so-called church fathers, from the end of the first century to the second century, interpreted the Bible
During the time of the Reformation, Wycliffe and his contemporaries rose up; then Luther consummated their teachings
Today we are standing on their shoulders, and a great deal of our knowledge of the Bible has been gained from them
Liberal theologians do not recognize the authority of the Bible or the existence of God as revealed in the Bible
There is still another theology which has been regarded as one of the schools among the fundamentalists, that is, reformed theology
The Second World War came, and the fighting was more intense; thus they became even more uncertain as to how the Lord Jesus could come back
In addition, during the first half of the last century, in the late 1820s, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England
There is one set of principles for the books of the Old Testament and another set of principles for the books of the New Testament
The culmination of Darby's writings was the five-volume commentary on the Bible called Synopsis of the Books of the Bible
The first category consists of the prophecies concerning the Lord Jesus; these are the prophecies with promises
Later, this prophecy and promise were also used to refer to the seed of Isaac , the seed of Jacob , and the seed of Judah
In 2 Samuel God promised that David would have a son who would reign as a king, and that His kingdom would last forever
The book of Isaiah prophesies, 'Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel'
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given his name shall be called The mighty God, The everlasting Father '
We find more prophecies in Zechariah: Christ is referred to as the wounded One , the One the Jews have pierced , and the smitten Shepherd
In addition the book of Psalms also has many prophecies concerning Christs incarnation crucifixion resurrection ascension and enthronement
According to history, the day of the Lord Jesus' crucifixion was exactly the last day of the four hundred eighty-three years
If we build with gold, silver, and precious stones, when the Lord comes back, we will be rewarded in addition to our salvation
Many proofs in the New Testament concerning the kingdom reward and punishment were initially seen by Govett and Panton
These were the Bible scholars prior to the time that the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as the state religion
Because the domain of the Roman Empire was so broad and because it had so many territories, most of the people remained isolated
, approximately 250 years, a number of councils were held, and some arguments concerning the truth were settled
Of course, the creeds come from the Bible, but they are only a supplement to the Bible, at the most just something auxiliary
One group even has a slogan admonishing people to go back to the Council of Nicaea and to accept its resolution
We cannot deny the fact that the church fathers did much in-depth study of the Bible prior to the Council of Nicaea
The pope and his archbishops would then study the issue and give a 'holy decree,' which was the final decision
By this we see that there were three periods: from the apostles to the Council of Nicaea , from the Council of Nicaea to about 590 A
After the Reformation, the Bible under the Protestant churches was made public, being freed from the chains of Catholicism
In the 1690s Bible readers discovered that in the Bible baptism does not mean washing or sprinkling but 'dipping into'
At that time a group of people in Europe received light from the Bible to see that there should be no rank among believers in the Lord
John Wesley, George Whitefield, and the master hymn writer Charles Wesley-all contemporaries of Zinzendorf- were also gained by the Lord
Many of them were knighted and held important government positions, yet they were absolute toward God and totally forsook the world
They had a deep knowledge concerning the inner life to such an extent that their writings could not be practiced by common people
After a period of time, a brother named William Law, who was a scholar from England, edited the books of the mystics
After this, Andrew Murray further improved the writings of the mystics by using plain words to bring out the deep truth
He is called not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus and the Spirit of Christ ; hence, the Spirit of Jesus Christ
By this example we can see that the teaching of the inner life people and of the Brethren have given us much help
He brought out many good points from the Catholic church, from the Greek Orthodox church, and from many of the Protestant denominations
We realized that we could not develop our practice in isolation, and that we needed to broaden our view by reading others' writings
We labored to collect and to study all of the prominent writings from the two thousand year history of Christianity
Using the Bible as our standard, we accepted whatever was according to the Bible and rejected whatever was not according to the Bible
Dallas Theological Seminary mainly uses Scofield's Reference Bible, and ninety percent of Scofield's teaching came from the Brethren
The Brethren theology is too literal and too objective; it needs to be balanced by the life line of the inner life people
The inner life group emphasizes the inner life, the reality, rather than the explanation of the letter of the Word
In order to encourage those who follow Him faithfully after salvation, God has set up a kingdom full of requirements to be their reward
The problem pointed out by the Arminians is not concerning perdition but concerning being unable to receive the kingdom
Although the Bible does say that a saved person may still have problems, this refers to the punishment and loss during the kingdom age
In this message we come to a very important subject, that is, some important truths that have been misunderstood
We must understand it literally, and we also need to take care of the context, using the entire Bible to explain any one verse
Through the New Jerusalem God will head up all things in Christ that the glory of God may be expressed eternally
When young brothers and sisters are just beginning to read the Bible, they may feel that this point does not mean much
Because many people do not know this point, their understanding of the Bible is not only superficial but also near-sighted
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Love is the source, grace is the manifestation and the flowing out, and fellowship is the transmission, the delivering
The flowing out of love is grace, the moving of grace is fellowship, and by the coming of the fellowship these things reach us
The church being the fullness of Christ means that the church is the overflowing of Christ, that is, the expression of Christ
It has been fourteen and a half years since my last visit, and now there are twelve churches that have been raised up in Australia
When you study, you need to search out all the books in the Gospel Book Room that are related to God's economy and God's dispensing
Although there are many inaccuracies in these debates, some of the debaters are scholars who have had very deep insights
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Through the working together of the sunshine water and air from the heavens and the plants animals and minerals from the earth we can live
Although He came in the person of the Son, it does not mean that the Father was left behind, but it means that the Father came in the Son
The first step was that this eternal God completed the work of creation, and He Himself came into the man whom He had chosen
Ephesians 4:6 says that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8 says that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4 says that the Spirit is God
Hebrews 112 says that the Son is eternal that His years shall not fail and Hebrews 73 says that He has no beginning of days nor end of life
We can see that all Three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-coexist simultaneously without succession from eternity to eternity
We need to realize that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was still in the Father and the Father was in Him
When we look at John 6:46 and 15:26 together, we realize that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all come together
John 6:46 says that the Son comes from the Father and with the Father, and John 14:26 says that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son
The Son became flesh through the conceiving of the Spirit, and the Son was filled with the Holy Spirit in His living and moving in the flesh
There is only one God with three modes; the Three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-do not exist simultaneously, but rather in succession
According to the modalistic view, first there was the Father, then there was the Son, and finally there is the Spirit
The other great heresy is tritheism, which says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist simultaneously and separately
A great opposition rose up because of this, and he gradually stopped preaching in this way, but inwardly he still believes this
According to my observation, in the United States many people believe that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods
They also point out that in John 171 the Lord lifted up His eyes to heaven and prayed Father glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You
It is clear that these people ignore the aspect that God is uniquely one and go to the extreme of emphasizing that God is three
We do not merely believe the aspect of God being uniquely one, nor do we merely believe the aspect of God being three
In recent years, fifty young brothers and sisters in the United States have been collecting materials from the ancient writings
The early fathers saw that there are two aspects of the divine Trinity: one is the aspect of essence, and the other is the aspect of economy
When the Lord Jesus was baptized at the age of thirty, He stood in the water and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him
During the thirty-three and a half years while the Lord Jesus was on the earth, until His death the Holy Spirit was in Him
After His resurrection, He breathed the life-giving Spirit into His disciples and He poured out the Spirit upon them on the day of Pentecost
Essentially, the Holy Spirit was breathed into them for their existence, and economically, He was poured upon them for their work
Many Christians have the concept that the Lord Jesus became a man in His incarnation, but that He was no longer a man after His resurrection
In Acts 7:56 it is recorded that when Stephen was persecuted and martyred, he saw the Son of Man, Jesus, standing at the right hand of God
In John 1:51 the Lord said, 'You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man'
The two have not only become one tree but are also mingled into one life to produce a compound fruit, not a fruit of a third nature
Our opposers say that our attachment to the Lord Jesus is a matter of being joined, and that it is not a mingling
Grafting is a mingling; two lives are mingled into one to produce a compound fruit, not a fruit of a third nature
The Lord is the bread of life for the believers to eat, and the Holy Spirit is the living water for the believers to drink
It is obvious that the son of a king has the life and nature of the king, but he is not the king and does not have the position of the king

Although the opposition in the United States has been somewhat subdued, these waves of theological debates will still flow to Taiwan
When these matters come up for discussion, you can bring out these verses and read them to the opposers one by one
