   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, a sick believer should not hastily seek after healing or methods of healing at first.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He does not need to be terrified or afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He should put himself fully in the light of God and sincerely examine and find the shortage in himself that has led to God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He should judge himself and condemn himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the Holy Spirit will reveal to him the area where he failed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever he sees he must repudiate immediately, and he must confess the sin to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If this sin has caused a loss to others, he should do his best to compensate and believe that God is pleased with this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He must consecrate himself anew to God and be willing to do all of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God "does not afflict willingly/Or grieve the children of men" Lam 3:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the self-conviction that He wants has been achieved, He will cease His scourging.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When His chastisement becomes no longer necessary, He will be very happy to withdraw it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible tells us that if we judge ourselves in this way, He will not condemn our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God wants us to be rid of sin and self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, when this is achieved, the sicknesses will end because they have accomplished their mission.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The great need of a believer today is to know that God chastens with a specific purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, he should allow the Holy Spirit to point out his sin so that God's purpose can be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God's goal is achieved, discipline is not needed anymore; God can and will heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After a believer confesses and eliminates his sin and believes that his sin has been forgiven, he can believe in God's promise and know with boldness that God will raise him up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His conscience will not accuse him anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, he has the boldness to come to God to ask for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are far away from God, we have difficulty believing, or we are unable to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, by obeying the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, by eliminating sin and evil, and by obtaining forgiveness, we will be led to the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once the source of the sickness is removed, the sickness will subsequently go away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since it is not hard for a sick believer to believe that the Lord has scourged his body because of sin, and since his sin has been forgiven, his body will also obtain forgiveness and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At such times, the Lord's presence will become more obvious, and His life will enter the body to enliven it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do we not know that our heavenly Father is not satisfied with us in many areas and wants to correct us?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By means of sicknesses He helps us understand our own shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not suppress the voice of our conscience, the Holy Spirit will surely tell us the reasons for our chastisement one by one, through our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is happy to forgive our sins and heal our sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The great work of the Lord Jesus' redemption includes both the forgiveness of sins as well as the healing of sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, He does not want to have any distance between us and Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He wants us to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, now is the time that we should completely obey and trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The heavenly Father would rather not scourge us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is so willing to heal us and bring us into a more intimate fellowship with Himself through our further perception of His love and power.</S>
