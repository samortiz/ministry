   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WITHOUT MURMURINGS AND REASONINGS, HOLDING FORTH THE WORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Philippians 2:14 Paul said, "Do all things without murmurings and reasonings."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although murmurings and reasonings are two small things, they are two real problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is hardly a couple which has no murmuring or reasoning between them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have also seen that murmuring is from the emotion and comes mostly from the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Reasoning is from the mind and comes mostly from the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Problems in our family life arise frequently from the sisters opening up their mouths first.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once they open their mouths, murmurings come out.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the brothers answer, they often get into reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps your life in the Training Center is not much different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But whenever we have murmurings and reasonings, we have not worked out our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, Paul said in verses 15 and 16, "You shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We the saved ones are the luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are qualified to reflect the divine light of Christ and to hold forth and demonstrate to others the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To hold forth the word of God's life is also a part of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Philippians 1 tells us that to be saved is to magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter two, to be saved is to live out salvation and to hold forth the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter three, to be saved is to be found in Christ v. 9 . If we murmur or reason, others will not find us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to realize that the way God ordains for Christians is the way of salvation which is also the way of expressing and magnifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The key to all these experiences is the death of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When that happens, others will see that we are a person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The righteousness in us will not be the result of our keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, it will be through faith and based on God's righteousness v. 9 . This is to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is also to magnify Christ and to live out salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE POWER OF RESURRECTION AND THE CONFORMATION TO THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Philippians 3:10 Paul continued on to say, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this passage, we see further the secret to experiencing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One of the secrets is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The other is the conformation to His death, which is the conformation to His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Stanza one of #631 in Hymns says, "If I'd know Christ's risen power, I must ever love the Cross."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The power of resurrection is our riches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are a rich man, you will spend your money gladly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be conformed to the cross is the way our riches are spent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This passage tells us the experience of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It shows us that if we do not know the power of resurrection and do not live in resurrection, there is no way for us to die by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the power of resurrection that bears us on to death and that takes us on the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today the reality of Christ's resurrection is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you live in the Spirit, you live in the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The last stanza of #631 in Hymns says, "If God thru th' Eternal Spirit nail me ever with the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is the Spirit who nails you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, it is not your colleagues or your husband or wife who is dealing with you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, it is the Holy Spirit in you who is taking you on in the experience of the Lord's death, so that you can be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the conformation to the cross comes about through the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why we must learn to exercise our spirit, experience the Spirit, and receive the killing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we would not receive the cross, but would only exercise our spirit, this experience of the spirit would not be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The result of a true exercise of the spirit will surely cause us to die and to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The cross and the Holy Spirit go together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The two also follow one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the one hand, we must receive the cross before the Holy Spirit will fill us up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the other hand, we must be full of the power of the Holy Spirit before we can receive the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The two complement each other.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From Philippians 3:10 we see that the power of resurrection is the Spirit, and the conformation to the cross is death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the secret to our experience of Christ.</S>
