   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PURITY OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our word must be backed up by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But in order to release a spirit that is pure and clean, we have to go through dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One thing is certain: The kind of spirit that we have determines the kind of expression of the Holy Spirit that we bear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kind of nature that we have dictates the aspect of the Holy Spirit that we express.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The manifestation of the Holy Spirit is different in different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just because we have the same Spirit does not mean that we have the same manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit who flows to others bears the characteristics of the channel through which He flows.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Holy Spirit flows, He carries along with Him the characteristic of the person who bears the flow, and He reaches men in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Holy Spirit is expressed in one way through one person and in another way through another person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One person can have one kind of ministry while another can have another kind of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit was expressed through Paul in one way and through Peter in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same Holy Spirit was manifested in Peter and in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was the Holy Spirit in both cases, but the manifestation in Peter carried Peter's flavor and characteristic, and the manifestation in Paul carried Paul's flavor and characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Holy Spirit does not annul the human elements in each person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God never annulled the human elements within each writer of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When one person is filled with the Holy Spirit, he has one kind of manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When another person is filled with the Holy Spirit, he has another kind of manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not everyone has the same expression and manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Holy Spirit fills a person, He carries the very characteristic of the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers, do you see our responsibility?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Holy Spirit reached others through the word alone, without any relation to our human nature, we would have no responsibility in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we only had to carry the Holy Spirit with us and convey it to others, without any involvement of our human elements, we would not have much responsibility; we would only need to carry Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the experiences of many saints show us that the Holy Spirit reaches other men with the special characteristic of the bearer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since this is the case, our spirit needs to be pure; it has to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, others will receive improper elements.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to realize that the human factor is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit does not operate independently or in an unprocessed manner.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our nature has a role to play.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Holy Spirit does not annul our nature; rather, He is released with our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord said, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" John 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord's word indicates that one must first drink the water, and then the rivers of living water must flow out of his innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>J. N. Darby points out that the innermost being refers to the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is out of the deepest part of one's being that the Holy Spirit flows; the Holy Spirit flows out together with the person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When this water reaches a person, the Holy Spirit carries this person's characteristics with Him, and flows to others this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, we have to learn to take the dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the cross comes to us, it should not come in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the cross works on us, we receive more carvings and dealings, and our being is purified even more.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every trial brings more purification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more fire we have, the more cleansing we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more trouble we suffer before the Lord and the greater such trouble is, the more our spirits are purified, and the purer will be the expression that the Holy Spirit assumes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A particular aspect of our character often goes through some dealings, but the work is not complete, and there are still impurities.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a result, others touch the Spirit of God at the same time that they touch the impurities.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come across a minister of the word, we often find that he has God's word, and his spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet, at the same time, his own person is too conspicuous; he is not broken enough.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The breaking he has received is not thorough enough.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Holy Spirit is released through him, but at the same time his own characteristics are released as well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers, our responsibility is too great!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the Spirit of the Lord worked absolutely independent of man or if the Holy Spirit rejected anyone who is flawed in any way, the matter would be much simpler.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It would be easy to tell the difference between the work of the flesh and the work of the Spirit if the Lord put us aside as soon as we were off just a little.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the trouble today is that the work of the flesh is still within us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even though our spirit is not pure enough, God does not reject us; He still uses us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many who are proud are under the illusion that they are useful and that they have passed the test.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God often uses a person even though there is still weakness in him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to realize that the more God uses us, the greater our responsibility is.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If God would not use us, we would have much less trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the Lord often uses us even though He knows that we are unqualified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Holy Spirit does not operate independently today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is not being released apart from man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a deep principle in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the Holy Spirit reaches out, His reaching is done in conjunction with man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord takes man up, together with all of his characteristics, in His release.</S>
