<h2 class="head2">Yuchung, Kansu Province</h2><p>To all my dear elder brothers in the Lord:</p><p>I was overjoyed to receive The Open Door (second issue)! The only problem was that my issue came so late. I was late in learning about the travels of the brothers and late in my rejoicing. Please do not forget me, this weak little brother in the Lord, because I think of you always. When I read The Open Door, I saw that all the brothers and sisters were very busy with the work and that you were laboring physically and in heart. I was moved to tears! Although we are living in difficult times, you do not cease to labor, but joyfully preach the gospel in all places. You also care for the brothers and sisters in each locality who have troubles. This sweet love has really encouraged my heart. The area in which I live witnesses no suffering and no work either. How long will I be in this useless state? I really want to go where you brothers are. I would be happy to do even the smallest task, although I do not know when the Lord will allow it. When I was meeting in my home in 1935 (Yih-Shi, Shansi), I wanted to go with Brother Yang Shao-tang. However, there is much red tape in leaving Kansu, and my environment did not permit it. At that time I vowed that I would serve the Lord four years later. It has already been three years, but I have not seen any sign from the Lord of using me. I do believe I am still the Lord's. As long as what I do is for the Lord, I trust that I am working for Him. Please pray for my weakness. I would like to continue to order three copies of The Open Door. I am sending X dollars with this letter to meet the needs of the brothers and sisters who lack. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Lee Geng-shun<br />January 9<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chu Wen-yao<br />on a Journey</h2><p>Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I have received your letter. I really thank you for your care in the Lord. A few days ago I was hindered by the Lord from going to Chungking. At that time I was very puzzled and did not know what God wanted. Even though we can be wrong, God is never wrong. When I returned to the meeting hall, I suddenly received a telegram telling me to go home to Shanghai with the travel money enclosed. I really thank God. I am now ready to go to Hong Kong and then on to Shanghai. In my heart I do not want to waste too much time in the city. I want to go to Yunnan or the surrounding countryside. I am praying about it now. I do not mean to say that I can do anything, because I know I am not worthy. However, I ask the gracious Lord to have mercy on me. Please pray for me. Peace in the Lord! Please greet Brother Chang and Miss Wang.</p><p>Chu Wen-yao<br />January 3</p><p>(A letter from Hong Kong says that Brother Chu arrived safely in Hong Kong.)</p>
