   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING BOUNDARIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today we want to speak concerning another matter related to the administration of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is the knowledge concerning boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Perhaps you have never realized that the knowledge of boundaries would have much to do with the administration of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may not even understand what the word boundaries means.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But I believe after you have read through this chapter you will become very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, let us consider the matter from the angle of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether it is in God's creation or in God's redemption, there are always clear boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, Genesis 1 speaks of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There the phrase "after their kind" is often repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although there are many kinds of plant life, yet each is after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although there are many kinds of animal life, each is also after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although all of them are all life, they are after their own kind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether it is the plant life or the animal life, each of them has its boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever these boundaries are exceeded, confusion immediately follows.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, when we come to Leviticus and Deuteronomy, in God's commandments to His people there are many references to the question of boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is forbidden that two kinds of lives be mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, God prohibited two kinds of seeds to be planted together in the same field.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He also would not allow both an ox and an ass to bear the same yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He would not permit the wearing of clothing with two different fibers woven together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Also God forbade men to wear women's clothing, and women to wear men's clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the New Testament, and especially in the Epistles, you can also find many teachings related to the matter of boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, we do not have the time to look into them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What we are doing here is only to bring out an issue, which is that in God's work He has set up all kinds of boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever these boundaries are broken down, there will be confusion, and God's work will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The administration of the church also has many boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If such were not the case, there would be no need for administration, and there would be no need for men to take up responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible shows us that in the church there are elders, deacons, and many other gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the services must be in proper order and according to the proper principles, and everything should have its definite boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for us to administrate the church, we must have a very clear knowledge concerning the matter of boundaries.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we will consider twelve different kinds of boundaries.</S>
