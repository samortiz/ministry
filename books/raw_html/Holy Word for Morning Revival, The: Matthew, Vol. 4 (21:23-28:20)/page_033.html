<p class="bold">WEEK 20 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Matt. 5:10 &nbsp;Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>6:33 &nbsp;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</p><p class="bold">Rom. 1:16 &nbsp;For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek.</p> <p class="bold">17 &nbsp;For the righteousness of God is revealed in it out of faith to faith.…</p><p>Psalm 89:14 &nbsp;Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne.…</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>[Matthew 5:10, 20 and 6:33] reveal that righteousness is related to the kingdom and that the kingdom is built upon righteousness. We need to be clear about this if we are to get into the depth of chapter twenty-seven.</p><p>In Matthew 27 we see a contrast between man’s unrighteousness and God’s righteousness.…Praise God that man’s unrighteousness turned into God’s righteousness!</p><p>The basic way in which man’s unrighteousness turned into God’s righteousness was through Christ.…In all of human history there has not been a case in which man’s unrighteousness has been as totally exposed as in the crucifixion of Christ. As we all know, there is unrighteousness in the judicial branch of any earthly government. But no earthly court has seen as much unrighteousness as was exposed in the case of the trial and crucifixion of the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Second, the Christ who exposed man’s unrighteousness to the uttermost also bore all the unrighteousness He had exposed.…This is like housecleaning.…In cleaning a room the dust is first exposed. Then it is swept into the dustpan. Likewise, on the day of the Passover, the Lord Jesus first exposed all the “dust,” all of man’s unrighteousness. Then He cleaned up the “dust” He had exposed. Oh, the very presence of the Lord Jesus exposed every particle of hidden “dust” in the whole universe. Eventually, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself became the “dustpan,” and all the “dust” was collected upon Him.…Thus, after all man’s unrighteousness had been exposed, it was borne by Christ on the cross. This made everything ready for the righteous God to come in to judge the unrighteous ones and all their unrighteousness.</p><p>This matter of righteousness is a crucial aspect of the truth of the gospel. This is very basic, for it is our ground and basis for being saved.…Through Christ our Substitute, we have already been judged according to righteousness on the cross. Therefore, God must save us.</p><p>Nothing binds God as much as His righteousness [Psa. 89:14]. If God’s righteousness could be taken away, His throne would be cast down. We can say, “Praise the Lord! Even if God wants to change His mind, He cannot do it because He is a just God!” How meaningful this is!</p><p>Righteousness, or justice, is a judicial matter. Love, on the contrary, is a matter of the emotion.…Whether God loves us or gives us up, He is not wrong. He also would not be wrong in showing grace to us or in not showing grace to us. Grace is a matter of God’s wish.…But righteousness is a matter neither of emotion nor of wish, it is a judicial matter. A judicial matter is related to the execution of the law, to legislation. God’s gospel is altogether a judicial matter, a matter of divine legislation.…Of course, God’s salvation is initiated by His love and accomplished through His grace. Eventually, however, it issues in His righteousness.…Our salvation has been sealed and confirmed by God’s righteousness. Now not even God Himself can change our salvation.…It is upon this righteousness that the kingdom of God is built.
