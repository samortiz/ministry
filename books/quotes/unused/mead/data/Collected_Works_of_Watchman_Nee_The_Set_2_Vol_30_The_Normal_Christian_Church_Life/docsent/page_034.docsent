   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Greek the word rendered "heresies" in Galatians 5:20 KJV does not necessarily convey the thought of error, but rather of division on the ground of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Interlinear New Testament translates it as "sects," while Darby in his New Translation renders it "schools of opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The whole thought here is not of the difference between truth and error, but of division based upon doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My teaching may be right or it may be wrong, but if I make it a cause of division, then I am guilty of the "heresy" spoken of here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God forbids any division on doctrinal grounds.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some believe that rapture is pre-tribulation; others, that it is post- tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some believe that all the saints will enter the kingdom; others believe that only a section will enter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some believe that baptism is by immersion; others, that is by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some believe that supernatural manifestations are a necessary accompaniment to the baptism in the Holy Spirit, while others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>None of these doctrinal views constitute a scriptural basis for separating the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Though some may be right and others wrong, God does not sanction any division on account of difference as to such beliefs.1 If a group of believers split off from a local church in their zeal for certain teaching according to the Word of God, the new "church" they establish may have more scriptural teaching, but it could never be a scriptural church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To bring error into a church is carnal, but to divide a church on account of error may also be carnal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is carnality that so often destroys the oneness of the church in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we wish to maintain a scriptural position, then we must see to it that the churches we found in various places only represent localities, not doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If our "church" is not separated from other children of God on the ground of locality alone, but stands for the propagation of some particular doctrine, then we are decidedly a sect, however true to the Word of God our teaching may be.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of God is that a church should represent the children of God in a locality, not represent some specific truth there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A church of God in any place comprises all the children of God in that place, not merely those who hold the same doctrinal views.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Should we arrive at a place where a church has already been established on clear local ground, and discover that its members hold views which we consider unscriptural, or that they consider the views we hold as unscriptural, if we then refuse to recognize them as the church of God in that locality and withdraw from fellowship, we are divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The question is not whether they agree with our presentation of truth, but whether they are standing on clear church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our hearts are set to preserve the local character of the churches of God, we cannot fail to come up against problems in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unless the cross operates mightily, what endless possibilities of friction there will be if we include in one church all the believers in the locality with all their varying views.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How the flesh would like just to include those holding the same views, and to exclude all whose views differ from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To have constant and close association with people whose interpretation of Scripture does not tally with ours, is hard for the flesh, but good for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God does not use division to solve the problem; He uses the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He would have us submit to the cross, so that through the very difficulties of the situation, the meekness and patience and love of Christ may be deeply wrought into our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under the circumstances, if we do not know the cross, we shall probably argue, lose our temper, and finally go our own way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may have right views, but God is giving us an opportunity to display a right attitude; we may believe aright, but God is testing us to see if we love aright.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is easy to have a mind well stored with scriptural teaching, and a heart devoid of true love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who differ from us will be a means in God's hand to test whether we have spiritual experience, or only scriptural knowledge, to test whether the truths we proclaim are a matter of life to us, or mere theory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 14 shows us how to deal with those whose views differ from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What would we do if in our church there were vegetarians and Sabbatarians?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why, we should consider it almost intolerable if in the same church some of the believers kept the Lord's Day and others the Sabbath, and some ate meat freely, while others were strict vegetarians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That was exactly the situation Paul was facing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us note his conclusions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Now him who is weak in faith receive, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his considerations" v. 1 . "Who are you who judge another's household servant? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will be made to stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand" v. 4 . "Therefore let us judge one another no longer, but rather judge this: not to put a stumbling block or cause of falling before your brother" v. 13 . Oh, for Christian tolerance! Oh, for largeness of heart! Alas! that many of God's children are so zealous for their pet doctrines that they immediately label as heretics, and treat accordingly, all whose interpretation of Scripture differs from theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God would have us walk in love toward all who hold views contrary to those views that are dear to us v. 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This does not mean that all the members of a church can hold whatever views they please, but it does mean that the solution to the problem of doctrinal differences does not lie in forming separate parties according to the different views held, but in walking in love toward those whose outlook differs from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By patient teaching we may yet be able to help all to "the oneness of the faith" Eph 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we wait patiently on the Lord, He may grant grace to the others to change their views, or He may grant us grace to see that we are not such good teachers as we thought we were.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nothing so tests the spirituality of a teacher as opposition to his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The teachers must learn humility, but so must all the other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When they recognize their position in the Body, they will know that it is not given to everyone to determine matters of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They must learn to submit to those who have been equipped of God for the specific ministry of teaching His people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Spiritual gifts and spiritual experience are necessary for spiritual teaching; consequently not everyone can teach.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Make my joy full, that you think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing, doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves; not regarding each his own virtues, but each the virtues of others also" Phil 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the churches have laid to heart what Paul wrote to the church in Philippi, then it will be perfectly possible to have only one church in one locality with no friction whatever among its many members.</S>
