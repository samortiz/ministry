This afternoon, I still want to say something more about the difference between a promise and a fact so that you can become clearer.</P><P>A promise is what God says before something is done, and a fact is what God says after something has been done. A promise is God's intention concerning something that is not yet done, while a fact is His declaration after His move and His acts.</P><P>This is the difference between God's promise and His fact. We need to see one thing concerning God's promise: a believer has to receive it in faith. Concerning God's fact, we have to receive it in faith, and we also have to apply His accomplished facts and act as if we believe that they are accomplished. Since God has given something to us, we do not have to repeatedly ask Him to do the same thing; all we have to do is apply what God has given us.</P><P>Now let us say something concerning the difference between God's promise and His fact. Every time we read the Bible, we have to ask if what we are reading is a promise or a fact. If it is a promise, all we have to do is ask in faith, and we will receive it. If it is a fact, we do not have to even ask; all we have to do is apply by faith, and we will have it.</P><P>This is all we will say for now concerning the difference between a promise and a fact. Now we will add another thing: the difference between God's covenant made with an oath, and His promises and facts. In the morning, we said that God's Word concerning grace includes three aspects: promises, facts, and covenants. This afternoon, we will cover the covenants. Every heart taught by grace should praise God for His established covenants with man. If we have never encountered difficulties, we do not know the wonder and preciousness of God's covenant. Why does God establish covenants with man? Are God's promises insufficient? God's promises are indeed precious. If we have never experienced poverty, suffering, sickness, or danger we do not know the preciousness of God's promises. When we are poor, God's promises will supply us. Then we will realize that His promises are manna from heaven and springs in the wilderness. When we are in serious sickness, or when we are helpless and without aid from anyone, God's promises help and heal us. When we encounter perils, dangers, and sufferings, God's messengers will look upon us, deliver us, and comfort us according to His Word. Only then will we realize that God's promises are sweet as honey, refreshing as water, and a rock of shadow in a dry land. Here we have no danger, here we are revived, and here we are allowed to rest. Unless we pass through great tribulations, sufferings, and dangers, we will never know the preciousness and sweetness of God's promises.</P><P>While God's promises are precious, His facts are more available than His promises. God not only gives us promises which will be fulfilled; He has also given us facts that are already fulfilled. Today God is not only giving us promises and accomplished facts; He is also making covenants with us. It is more glorious for God to make a covenant with us than for Him to promise or accomplish something for us. When God establishes a covenant with us, He binds Himself. A covenant takes away God's own freedom so that we can have all that He is.</P><P>Who established the covenants with man? God established them. Do you know the meaning of a covenant? A covenant is something righteous; a covenant relates to justice and the law. Once we mention a covenant, there cannot be any consideration of personal desire, pleasure, or grace. A covenant can only be executed according to righteousness, justice, and the law. Grace cannot execute a covenant. Suppose that I agreed to give a brother five dollars every morning. Do not ask why I would make such a covenant with the brother; just remember that if I made such a covenant, I would have to give him five dollars every morning. Since I made such a covenant and signed my name in the covenant, I would be unrighteous and dishonest if I did not keep this covenant. I would be acting contrary and unfaithfully to my own words. This would immediately lower my own moral standard. Doing this would be acting contrary to law and justice; rather, I would be acting according to my own will. Have you seen that when God makes a covenant with man, He puts Himself in a very restricted position? God is able to deal with man according to His own will. If He so desired, He could deal with you in grace, and if He did not desire, He could deal with you harshly. If He so desired, He could save you one day, and if He did not desire, He could choose not to save you the next day. If God is not bound by a covenant, He can act freely according to His own pleasure. If He is outside a covenant, He can hold back His will. He has the freedom to do this. If He wants to do something, He can do it. If He does not want to do something, He can choose not to do it. But if God has made a covenant, He is bound by it. God has to act according to the covenant. Hallelujah! God is bound by the covenant. God has sacrificed His desires and His freedom for the sake of the covenant! Brothers and sisters, do you realize that this is the highest expression of grace? This is not just God's promising us a plenitude of food and raiment, or deliverance from dangers and sufferings. This is not just the declaration of God's accomplished facts for our application. This is God putting Himself in our position; God has put Himself in a covenant. Whether or not He likes it, God has to carry out the covenant. No matter what His desire is, He has to carry the covenant out. He cannot change the words in His covenant. What a wonderful thing that God has established covenants with us.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 09: The Present Testimony (2) &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
