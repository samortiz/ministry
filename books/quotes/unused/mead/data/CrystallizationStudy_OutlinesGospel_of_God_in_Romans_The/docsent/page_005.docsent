   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s holy nature sanctifies our worldly disposition; God sanctifies us dispositionally out of His divine life and unto His divine life that we may enjoy more of His divine life 6:19, 22; 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The indwelling law of the Spirit of life, that is, the automatic and spontaneous working of the Triune God as life in us, frees us from the law of sin and of death, the slavery and bondage of sin; the operation of this law comes out of God s divine life, and it also causes the increase of the divine life in us 8:2, 11.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Divine Trinity s divine dispensing in our spirit, soul, and body causes these three parts to be saturated with the processed divine life, with the result that our entire being is completely united with the processed Triune God and mingled with Him as one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>5-11.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The renewing of our mind by the Spirit results in the transformation of our soul, which saves us from being conformed to the modern style of the world and issues in all the virtues and the overcoming, mentioned in chapters 12 through 16, as our daily life, a life of the highest standard, and as our church life, a life that is all-overcoming 12:2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the renewing of our mind and the transformation of our soul, we become members one of another with all believers in the Body of Christ and are built up together as the Body of Christ and thereby have the service of the Body; this is the crystallization of our experience of the saving in Christ s life vv.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By becoming the built-up church, a church against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail, in different localities, we afford God the opportunity to crush Satan under our feet that we may enjoy Christ as our rich grace and the God of peace as our surpassing peace 16:20.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our experience of the various aspects of the saving in the divine life, as mentioned above, we are being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God through the all things arranged under God s sovereignty, so that we have His divine attributes and His human virtues and thereby express the glory and beauty of Him, the God-man 8:28-29.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the process of our experience of the saving in the divine life, the splendor of the divine life gradually saturates us until it saturates our body, issuing in the redemption of our body, that our spirit, soul, and body may all enter into the glory of God; this glorification is the peak attained in us by the saving in the divine life, and it is the climax of God s full salvation vv.</S>
