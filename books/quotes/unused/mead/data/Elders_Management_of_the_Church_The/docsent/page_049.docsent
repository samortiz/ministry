   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord said that the elders in the church are likened to shepherds of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You can understand what this means by watching a shepherd: while he rules over the sheep, he is loving his sheep with a fervent love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The food, the water to drink, the resting place, and the protection for the sheep are all prepared by the shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With him there is the outflow of love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result, the sheep hear his voice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was once in Scotland.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was a big ranch there with a number of sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The shepherd had a few special dogs that were small and short, with short legs, and he used them to protect his sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the shepherd led the flock to the meadows, sometimes the sheep would move in a scattered way and would go astray.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The shepherd wanted them to stay in the meadows, but they would run away to the creeks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to gather them back to the flock, the shepherd would give a certain signal to the dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Immediately, the dogs would run out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They could run faster than the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the sheep were large and the dogs were small, the dogs were very fierce, and the sheep had to turn back to the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once I saw two or three sheep running away from the flock, and the shepherd was helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he were to chase after one, the others would have run away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And if he were to chase after another, still others would have run away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The shepherd gave a command, and one of the dogs obediently ran in front of the sheep and barked fiercely at the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The amazing thing was that though the dog was fierce, it never hurt the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way, the sheep all turned back, and within a short time, the dogs had rounded up all the sheep that had strayed and brought them back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The expression of the dogs seemed very fierce, but yet you would feel that they were full of affection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the sheep came back, the shepherd was also full of tenderness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I thought that this was very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even the ferocity shown to the sheep was an expression of love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the discipline of love, and it is absolutely an expression of love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Often children are very perceptive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some parents punish their children very severely, but the more they punish them, the more the children are drawn to them, because they know that the parents love them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if someone does not have love, the children can also feel the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some parents can speak very harsh words, words which others would consider extremely serious, yet the children can taste the love in those harsh words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes a guest may say some pleasant and sweet words to a child, but the child knows that the words have nothing to do with him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even a one-year-old or a two-year-old can sense this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the elders should realize that, while there is the need of proper authority in the management of the church, and without it there cannot be a proper management of the church, yet in being the authority, the elders must turn their authority into love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It should appear to others that authority is completely gone, and that everything is love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Love is authority transformed, in much the same way that the body of the Lord Jesus was God transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He never caused others to feel that He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, He caused others to feel that He was fully a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the same principle, those who are the authority should not cause others to feel that they are the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the contrary, they should cause others to feel that everything is absolutely a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the brothers and sisters cannot sense love in you, you have no position, no ground, and no standing to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To be an authority, one must have love.</S>
