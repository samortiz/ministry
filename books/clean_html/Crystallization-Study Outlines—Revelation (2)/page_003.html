<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 14:1-5, 14-16; 15:2-4</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The rapture is not mainly for our enjoyment but for God&rsquo;s enjoyment; we need to be raptured to heaven, not for our happiness but for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;12:5, 7-10; 14:1, 4b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The meaning of rapture is to be taken into the Lord&rsquo;s presence; in order to be taken into the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we must be in His presence today&mdash;Luke 21:36; 2 Cor. 2:10.</li>
	<li>The rapture is for defeating the enemy and satisfying God&mdash;Rev. 12:5; 14:1, 4b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God has a need for us to be raptured; we must be raptured to heaven that we may fight against the enemy&mdash;12:5, 7-11.</li>
		<li>The Lord needs the man-child to fight against His enemy, but He needs the firstfruits even more for His satisfaction&mdash;14:1, 4b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Bible reveals two aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers&mdash;Matt. 24:40-41; Luke 21:36; Rev. 3:10; 1 Thes. 4:15-17; Rev. 12:5; 14:1.</li>
	<li>In Leviticus 23:10 we see a type of the rapture&mdash;the type of the crop ripening in the field&mdash; Matt. 13:24; Rev. 14:14-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reaping of God&rsquo;s crop is what we call the rapture; this reaping indicates that the believers will be taken away from the earth&mdash; Matt. 13:30, 39b.</li>
		<li>Part of the crop&mdash;the firstfruits&mdash;ripens earlier and is reaped earlier; the rest of the crop&mdash;the harvest&mdash;ripens later and is reaped later.</li>
		<li>According to Revelation 14 there are two kinds of rapture&mdash;the rapture of the firstfruits and the rapture of the harvest&mdash;vv. 4b, 14-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The firstfruits in Revelation 14:1-5 are the living overcomers who will be the first ripe ones in God&rsquo;s field; hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The firstfruits will be caught up to the heavenly Mount Zion, to the place of God&rsquo;s dwelling in the third heaven, in order to be in the presence of God and Christ&mdash;14:1, 4b.</li>
	<li>The firstfruits are raptured to the house of God in Zion as the fresh enjoyment to God; this is for God&rsquo;s satisfaction&mdash;Exo. 23:19a; Lev. 23:10; cf. John 20:17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The firstfruits satisfy the hunger of God the Father and the Lamb, the Redeemer.</li>
		<li>Whereas the man-child is for fighting to deal with the enemy, the firstfruits are for the satisfaction of God and the Lamb.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The firstfruits are believers who are saturated with Christ; they have been fully occupied by Christ and taken over by Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a; Gal. 4:19.</li>
	<li>The firstfruits have the name of the Lamb and of His Father written on their foreheads; this is the designation of their being one with the Lamb and with the Father and of their belonging to Them&mdash;Rev. 14:1b.</li>
	<li>The one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits are believers who are for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;v. 1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The number twelve signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity; this mingling is for the completion of God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
		<li>Twelve multiplied by twelve means completion of completions, the completion in God&rsquo;s administration for the fulfillment of His economy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The firstfruits are the earliest ones among God&rsquo;s crop to reach maturity&mdash;Heb. 5:14&mdash;6:1; 1 Cor. 2:6; Eph. 4:13; Phil. 3:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be transformed is to be changed in our natural life; to be matured is to be filled with the divine life that changes us&mdash;Rom. 12:2; Eph. 3:19b.</li>
		<li>For God&rsquo;s expression there is the need of maturity; only a mature life can bear God&rsquo;s image and exercise His dominion&mdash;Gen. 1:26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The harvest in Revelation 14:14-16 is the rapture of the majority of the believers:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Whereas the firstfruits are taken to the throne in the heavens before the great tribulation, the harvest is taken to the air (the barn&mdash;Matt. 13:30; 3:12) toward the end of the tribulation, that is, at the last trumpet&mdash;1 Thes. 4:16-17; 1 Cor. 15:52; Rev. 10:7.</li>
	<li>All those included in the rapture of the harvest must pass through the greater part of the great tribulation&mdash;Matt. 24:21; Rev. 3:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The harvest will be left to pass through the great tribulation because green, unripened fields need strong sunshine to ripen&mdash;14:15; Matt. 13:39b.</li>
		<li>In a sense, the great tribulation will be the strong sunshine which will ripen all the believers who were not ready before the tribulation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If today we do not give up the world and live to Christ, Christ will leave us on earth to pass through the great tribulation&mdash;Matt. 16:26; 2 Cor. 5:14-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>At that time the believers will give up the world and realize that the best way to live is to live to Christ&mdash;James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17; Rom 14:7-8.</li>
		<li>The time will come when all the believers will realize that they need to ripen and mature&mdash; Mark 4:26-29; 1 Cor. 3:1-2; 14:20; Col. 1:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The harvest will be reaped by the Son of Man; He came as the Son of Man to sow the seed, and He will come again as the Son of Man to reap what He has sown&mdash;Matt. 13:37; Rev. 14:14.</li>
	<li>Regarding the rapture, we all need to receive the warning and to see God&rsquo;s purpose and our responsibility to cooperate with Him&mdash;2 Tim. 4:8; Rev. 16:15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Revelation 15:2-4 unveils the rapture of the late overcomers, who overcome Antichrist, his mark, the number of his name, and his image:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although they are slain by Antichrist, in the eyes of God they are victorious.</li>
	<li>The late overcomers sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb&mdash;v. 3a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The song of Moses indicates God&rsquo;s triumphant judgment over the enemy of His people&mdash;Exo. 15:1-18.</li>
		<li>The song of the Lamb indicates Christ&rsquo;s redemption experienced by God&rsquo;s people in the presence of their enemy.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The late overcomers praise God for His works and His ways, that is, for His acts and His principles&mdash;Rev. 15:3b-4; Psa. 103:7.</li>
	</ol></li>
