<h2 class=head1>ACTIVATING THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>After reading this message, will you pray like this? “Lord, thank You for such a message. You know how weak I am. I need Your help. Grant that I may be able to live according to what the message says.” Do not pray like this! Then what should you do? Be at rest. To activate the law of the Spirit of life, all you need to do is turn on the switch. Romans 8 says:<p>(1)Walk according to spirit (v. 4).<p>(2)Set the mind on the spirit (v. 6).<p>(3)Put to death the practices of the body (v. 13).<p>(4)Be led by the Spirit as sons of God (v. 14).<p>(5)Cry, Abba Father (v. 15). When you cry, the indwelling Spirit cries with you (Gal. 4:6).<p>(6)Witness (v. 16). When you witness, the Spirit witnesses with you.<p>(7)Groan for full sonship, the redemption of your body (v. 23). Say: “Lord, I praise You that today You are the firstfruit for my enjoyment. Yet my body is old. I need full sonship. My body needs to be ‘sonized.’ Not only so, Lord, look upon my brothers in the denominations. Consider their situation.”<p>If we practice these seven things all day long, we shall find that the righteous requirement of the law will spontaneously be fulfilled in us. God will rescue us and answer our cry, “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?” (Rom. 7:24). Who? The law of the Spirit of life will free us from our wretched condition if we fulfill the requirements we have just mentioned.<p>We need both the realization and the practice. Then we shall experience the freedom from the law of sin and of death by the law of the Spirit of life.
