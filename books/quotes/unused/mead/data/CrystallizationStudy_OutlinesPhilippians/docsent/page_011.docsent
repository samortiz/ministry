   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Eleven Taking Christ as Our Secret and as Our Power Scripture Reading: Phil 4:11-13 The subject of the book of Philippians is the experience of Christ in every kind of circumstance 1:19-21a; 2:5; 3:9-10; 4:11-13.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Philippians 4 Christ is the secret and the power for us to enjoy; we know the secret, and we have the power vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>12-13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul had learned the secret of sufficiency, of satisfaction, of contentment; this secret is actually Christ Himself vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>11-12: In any environment and in any matter, Paul, who experienced Christ richly and abundantly, learned the secret to be content and to rejoice always v. 4.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the book of Philippians as a whole, the secret Paul learned was simply Christ; Paul took Christ as the secret to experience Christ, being content and rejoicing in any situation and in any matter because of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul had not only learned a secret; he had been initiated and had learned certain basic principles v. 12: Paul had been initiated both into the proper Christian life and into the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After Paul was converted to Christ, he was initiated into Christ and into the Body of Christ Acts 9:3-19, 25-28; 22:6-21; 13:1-4: He was initiated into the basic principles of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He learned the secret of how to take Christ as life Col 3:4 , how to live Christ Phil 1:21a , how to magnify Christ v. 20 , how to gain Christ 3:8, 12 , and how to have the church life 1:8, 19; 2:1-4, 19-20; 4:1-3 . When we are saved and come into the church, the Body of Christ, we need to be initiated by learning certain basic principles 1 Tim 3:15-16: We are initiated in Christ, with Christ, and by Christ; because Christ is our secret, we know how to face any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because the church has a mysterious aspect, we need to be initiated by learning certain basic principles Eph 3:3, 9; 5:32.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The secret of the Body is to take Christ as our life, to live Christ, to pursue Christ, to gain Christ, to magnify Christ, and to express Christ; these are the basic principles of the church, the Body of Christ Rom 12:4-5.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In everything refers to a particular time when we experience a certain thing of the Lord; in all things refers to a broad range of experiences over time Phil 4:12: Paul could say that both on a particular occasion and on all occasions, both at a certain time and throughout the course of his life, he had learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul experienced Christ moment by moment: He experienced Christ in particular things at particular times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He experienced Christ in all things and at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verse 13 we have a basic principle related to Paul s secret of sufficiency in Christ: I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me : The secret in Philippians 4 is to do all things in Christ John 15:4a, 5: Whatever we do should be done in Christ, not in ourselves; this is the secret Paul learned and the secret we need to learn today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is sufficient for us to be in Christ, for He is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way to experience Christ is to do everything in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do all things in Christ, we shall experience Christ, enjoy Christ, and accumulate Christ; this is the way to become rich in Christ and to have many rich experiences of Christ Eph 3:8.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The issue of practicing the secret of being in Christ is that for us to live is Christ; because we do all things in Christ, we live Christ Phil 1:21a.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul s word in 4:13 is an all-inclusive and concluding word on his experience of Christ: Paul was a person in Christ, and he desired to be found by others in Christ 2 Cor 12:2a; Phil 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 4:13 he declared that, being in Christ, he could do all things in Him, the very Christ who empowered him; this was his secret.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a person in Christ, Paul experienced Christ and applied Him in all circumstances vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>11-12: Paul applied the Christ in whom he could be found 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Christ is real, living, near, available, and prevailing 4:5b.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be empowered is to be made dynamic inwardly v. 13: Christ dwells in us, and He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within, not from without Col 1:27.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By such an inward empowering Paul could do all things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul s word about Christ as the empowering One specifically applies to Christ s empowering us to live Him as our human virtues and thereby to magnify Him in His unlimited greatness Phil 4:8-13: The application of verse 13 is limited by the context of verses 8 through 13.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life and be true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>11-12, 8.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To live a life of these virtues is much more difficult than doing a Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are persons in Christ, who empowers us to live out every kind of virtue; this is to live Christ and to magnify Him in His virtues 1:20-21a.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we would experience Christ as the empowering One, we need to let Him live in us Gal 2:20 , be formed in us 4:19 , make His home in us Eph 3:17a , and be magnified in us Phil 1:20 : If we fail to do these things, Christ will not have the way to empower us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ lives in us, is formed in us, makes His home in us, and is magnified in us, the way is prepared for Him to empower us; then, empowered by the indwelling Christ, we shall be able to do all the things spoken of in 4:8-12.</S>
