Joab's Killing of Amasa</H2><P>Verses 8 through 13 speak of Joab's killing of Amasa. Amasa came to meet Joab and his followers, and Joab struck Amasa in his stomach with a sword and poured out his bowels onto the ground (vv. 8-10a). Then all the people turned to follow Joab and his brother Abishai to pursue after Sheba the rebel (vv. 10b-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3.

A wise woman offered to Joab a way to kill Sheba, and Sheba was slain (vv. 16-22a). Joab then blew the trumpet to disperse the people from the city and returned to Jerusalem to David the king (v. 22b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII.
