   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ASCENSION AND GLORIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans covers not only the attributes of righteousness and holiness, but also the attribute of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Glorification began at the time of Christ s ascension, and it will consummate at His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ s ascension is for glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, Christ s death is for God s righteousness, His resurrection is for God s holiness, and His ascension is for God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Christ comes back, the glorification of His saints will be consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This thought is found in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 17 Paul says that if we suffer with Christ, we shall be glorified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 18 he goes on to say, For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The whole creation is eagerly expecting to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God v. 21 . In verse 30 Paul says that those whom God has predestinated, called, and justified, He has also glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we are being sanctified, we are also being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With sanctification we enjoy a foretaste of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have pointed out that glorification began with Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As believers in Christ, we are ascended with Christ and seated with Him in the heavenlies Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is both in us subjectively and in the heavenlies objectively.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ has brought us into the heavenlies, and He has brought the heavenlies into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we realize the fact that we share in Christ s ascension, we experience not only sanctification, but also glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be in ascension is to be in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>HOLINESS, AND GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need the subjective experience of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be crucified with Christ is to experience righteousness, and to have Christ live in us is to experience holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to His righteousness and through His holiness, the Triune God is dispensed into us in a full way unto His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the result of God s dispensation is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When people contact us or visit our homes, they should be able to sense that we have died with Christ and that Christ is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If this is our situation, then we shall exhibit God s righteousness, holiness, and even His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How we praise the Lord for opening the depths of this book to us!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Romans 3 and 4 we see that Christ died for us and in Romans 6, that we died in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This death was according to God s righteousness and for His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Romans 6 through 8 we see that we are being sanctified through the living, acting, moving, and working of the resurrected Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the resurrected Christ germinates us and generates us, He sanctifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sanctification includes transformation and conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the process of sanctification takes place within us, we begin to experience God s glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The issue of the dispensation of the Triune God into us is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we daily take our stand of having died with Christ, we shall have the subjective experience of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then if we allow Christ to live in us, we shall have the subjective experience of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The result will be glory, the expression of God from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IN HIS DISPENSATION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as righteousness is God s procedure and holiness is God s nature, so glory is God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ultimate goal of the dispensation of the Triune God is that God be expressed through the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Body of Christ has become the expression of God s glory, that will be the time of full glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As Romans 8 reveals, the universe is eagerly awaiting this time, anxiously waiting to enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this glory God will be expressed in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will be the ultimate issue of the dispensation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every local church today should be a miniature of such a glorious expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We in the churches should be able to say, Satan, look at the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here you can see God s righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Satan sees this, he will be forced to admit that this is the issue of the dispensation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because we all have died in Christ and are therefore righteous in the eyes of God, there is no ground for Satan to accuse us or to condemn us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now Christ is living in us to sanctify us, to transform us, and to conform us to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The issue of this process is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This should be the testimony borne by every church in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In every church there must be the base of God s righteousness, the process of God s holiness, and the goal of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the dispensation of the Triune God according to His righteousness, through His holiness, and unto His glory as revealed in the book of Romans.</S>
