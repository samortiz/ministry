<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LIVING AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gal. 5:25; 2:20a; Phil. 1:19-21a; Gal. 5:16a; Rom. 6:4; 8:4; Gal. 6:16; Phil. 3:16</H1><P>In this message we will consider the matter of living and walking by the Spirit. This matter is crucial to the believers and crucial to the Christian life. Our living and walking by the Spirit include three main things&#151;the all-inclusive Spirit, the all-inclusive death of Christ, and the life-releasing and producing resurrection of Christ. Apparently, according to the letter, these three things have nothing to do with one another. Actually, however, these three things are compounded into one. The Spirit in the New Testament is the compound Spirit, even the compounded Spirit. The compound ointment in Exodus 30 is the best type of the compound Spirit. That ointment was not made of only a single ingredient&#151;olive oil&#151;but was made of olive oil compounded with four kinds of spices.</P><P>We cannot see the Spirit, because He is invisible. We also have something within us that is invisible to us&#151;our spirit. These two spirits&#151;the Spirit and our spirit&#151;are both invisible, yet they are more than real. According to our experience, we do have a part within us that the Bible calls our spirit (Job 32:8; Prov. 20:27; Zech. 12:1; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 16:18; 1 Thes. 5:23; 2 Tim. 4:22). Moreover, God is Spirit (John 4:24). Although we cannot understand this, because we have a spirit, we can realize it by our own experience.</P><P>The Triune God has gone through all the processes in Christ to become the all-inclusive, compound Spirit. Today this Spirit is marvelous. In Him we have the Triune God, and in Him we also have the uplifted humanity. Without the Bible we cannot understand that in the Spirit, who is the divine Spirit, there is the uplifted humanity, the humanity of the highest standard. Furthermore, in the Spirit there is also Christ's humanity with His human living. All these items are in this Spirit. Even more, in the Spirit there is Christ's death. Because this death is not simple, we have called it the all-inclusive death. This death solved the problems and terminated the negative things in the universe, and this death also released the divine life. We need to realize that in the Spirit we have such a wonderful death. Finally, in this Spirit we also have the life-releasing and producing resurrection of Christ.</P>
