[1]  To see the intensified Spirit we need to spend a little time to look into the whole New Testament.
[2]  The first chapter of the New Testament tells us how Christ was God incarnated to be a man, and this wonderful man is called Emmanuel, God with us v. 23 . God was incarnated to be a man so that He could be with us.
[3]  Then, at the end of the Gospel of Matthew, we are told to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit 28:19 .
[4]  Then when we come through the New Testament to the last book of Revelation, it is so interesting to notice that the Spirit of God is put into the second place of the Godhead.
[5]  Let us read these verses: John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth.
[6]  Today is not the age of Matthew but the age of Revelation, and we must realize that now we are not at the beginning of the age of Revelation but at the end. The age has been changed to the Spirit.
[7]  I am so burdened for the present situation of the Lord s people because of today s deadness: the dead teachings, the dead meetings, the dead churches, the dead knowledge, the dead messages, the dead books, and even the dead Bible.
[8]  It is not just a matter of the word spoken by the Lord or the word written in the Bible, but the speaking of the sevenfold Spirit.
[9]  He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[10]  Today people speak so much about the universal church, but they look down upon the local churches.
[11]  However, the Lord Jesus in Revelation speaks to the local churches.
[12]  If He is speaking to the local churches, yet you are outside the local churches, you will completely miss this book.
[13]  They have never seen the sevenfold Spirit for the local churches, because they are not in the local churches.
[14]  Today we need the burning as well as the enlightening and enlivening of the intensified Spirit so that we may be set on fire to see the local churches and the Lord s purpose and so that we might be made living.
[15]  It is so strange that the intensified Spirit is not only the seven lamps but also the seven eyes of the Lord.
[16]  I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth 5:6 .
[17]  When the Lord was on earth, He had only two eyes, and I believe His eyes were always so mild and gentle.
[18]  Yet we must keep in mind that this burning, sevenfold Spirit is not for any individual or for the so-called universal church.
[19]  At the beginning there are the seven golden lampstands, and at the end the golden city, the New Jerusalem.
[20]  There are the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls mentioned in this book, but these are not in the beginning or at the end. At the beginning are the seven golden lampstands, and at the end is the golden city.
[21]  Therefore, we must have a thorough look into the local churches, for as we have seen, this book is a book of the seven Spirits for the local churches.
[22]  I believe there has never been a person on the earth who has not known something about God.
[23]  In the school they may deny the existence of God, but at home they ask themselves, Suppose there is a God, what shall I do?
[24]  All human beings know about God, but only a small number know both God and Christ, because Christ is a real mystery.
[25]  We need to know God first, we need to know Christ second, and then we must go on to know the church.
[26]  If we have sixty-six books in our Bible, we not only have God, Christ, and the church, but we also have the local churches.
[27]  We all realize that everything is in the Bible.
[28]  But not long after the New Testament was completed, the church began to lose all the important things found in the Bible.
[29]  If we read the history of the church, especially the history of the Lord s recovery, we will see that it was from 1829 that the British Brethren, under the leadership of John Nelson Darby, became clear concerning the doctrine of the church.
[30]  There are some who talk so much about the universal church.
[31]  Those who are so much for the universal church say that the invisible church is the real one, and all the visible churches are the false ones.
[32]  CHAPTER THREE THE FOUR VISIONS IN REVELATION IN SPIRIT
[33]  In the book of Revelation the writer, the apostle John, tells us four times that he was in spirit.
[34]  The first time he was in spirit on the Lord s Day and saw seven golden lampstands: I was in spirit on the Lord s Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet...And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands 1:10, 12 .
[35]  The second time he was in spirit, he saw a throne: After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things.
[36]  The third time, John was carried away in spirit to the wilderness and saw the great Babylon: He carried me away in spirit into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns...And on her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH 17:3, 5 .
[37]  The fourth vision is that of the New Jerusalem, which is covered from chapter 19 through chapter 22.
[38]  These four visions compose the entire content of the book of Revelation.
[39]  So we see that this book simply speaks about these four things: the local churches, the world under God s judgment, the great Babylon as a harlot mother with many harlot daughters, and the New Jerusalem.
[40]  The local churches are in the beginning, and the New Jerusalem is at the end. In between are the world and the great Babylon under God s judgment.
[41]  My second burden is to expose the subtlety of the enemy.
[42]  When we were in the denominations and began to see the light concerning the Lord s way, the subtlety of the enemy was to condemn us by saying that we were only causing more divisions.
[43]  BEING FOR EATING AND DRINKING CHRIST THE STRANGE EMPHASIS IN REVELATION
[44]  In the book of Revelation there is something very strange.
[45]  John wrote to the seven churches which were in Asia v. 4 . The Lord Jesus told him that what he saw, he was to write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea v. 11 . Seven churches equal seven cities; therefore, to one church means to one city, and to one city means to one church.
[46]  To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God v. 7 . In the first of the seven epistles in this book, the promise is the promise of eating, and in the last one the promise is also of eating.
[47]  What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches 1:11 .
[48]  These seven churches are not the seven churches on the streets, on the campuses, in the homes, or in the factories.
[49]  There are seven to s. The Lord told John to send this book to the seven churches as follows: to, to, to, to, to, to, to.
[50]  We must be in the local churches, and the Lord s intention in the local churches is simply for us to eat and drink.
[51]  Here we enjoy Christ, here we minister Christ, here we eat Christ, and here we drink Christ.
[52]  CHAPTER FIVE THE BURNING FIRE AND THE FLOWING WATER
[53]  In this book for the local churches, the Spirit of God is the seven Spirits before the throne.
[54]  Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne v. 4b . Here the sevenfold intensified Spirit is now in the second place of the Triune God.
[55]  On the negative side we are burned, but praise the Lord, on the positive side we are being watered.
[56]  Even when we are in a kind of darkness, if we will just say, O Lord! the light will shine.
[57]  In this chapter we must see something of Christ in Revelation.
[58]  Christ in this book is quite different from all the other books of the Bible.
[59]  We may have been Christians for years but did not realize that Christ today is the glorious man walking in the midst of the local churches.
[60]  Then we read that the Christ in Revelation has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace.
[61]  In the local churches there should be no coldness or lukewarmness, because Christ is the burning One.
[62]  Christ is the One who is walking in the midst of the local churches, and He is the High Priest whose work is accomplished but who has a concern of love for the local churches.
[63]  In Revelation 2:1 the Lord says, These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, He who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands.
[64]  The seven stars are the leading ones in the local churches.
[65]  He is walking in the midst of the local churches, and He is holding the leading ones.
[66]  Then Revelation 3:1 tells us that He is not only holding the leading ones, but He also has the seven Spirits.
[67]  The seven Spirits are not only for the seven churches but also for the leaders of the local churches.
[68]  May the Lord give us the vision to see this Christ in the local churches, a Christ who is absolutely different from the Christ in Christianity.
[69]  Now we must see from Revelation how the local churches in the Lord s recovery are also different.
[70]  After reading the epistles to the seven local churches, we realize that the Lord s speaking here is very different from His speaking in the Epistles written by the apostle Paul.
[71]  If we want to know what the local churches should be like in the Lord s recovery during the time of degradation, we must see what the Lord demands and requires in these seven epistles.
[72]  The Lord says, I know your works and your labor and your endurance and that you cannot bear evil men; and you have tried those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false; and you have endurance and have borne all things because of My name and have not grown weary.
[73]  We should love the church, but we should not love it as much as we love the Lord Jesus.
[74]  If we have the first love and the best love toward the Lord Jesus, we will be a shining lampstand, and we will enjoy the Lord Jesus as the tree of life.
[75]  The third epistle was written to Pergamos, and the Lord mainly dealt with two things: the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
[76]  I have a few things against you, that you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication.
[77]  The fourth epistle is to Thyatira, in which fornication and idols are dealt with.
[78]  I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices v. 2:20 .
[79]  Have you ever realized that Revelation is a book of life?
[80]  A good number of books have been written as expositions of this book, but most of them are written along the line of prophecy.
[81]  Praise the Lord, we need life, and Christ is life, and Christ is God.
[82]  If we read the Bible from Genesis 1 to the Gospel of John, we see that in Him Christ was life John 1:4 , and He says, I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly 10:10 .
[83]  Then in the last book of the Bible, the Lord says, I am...the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever Rev 1:17-18 .
[84]  To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life 2:7 .
[85]  Therefore, in this last book we have all these terms: tree of life, crown of life, book of life, water of life, and waters of life.
[86]  We must take something into us as life, we must put something upon us as life, and we must be recorded in the book of life.
[87]  He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street v. 1 . This means that out of the redeeming God, the Lamb-God, proceeds the river of life, and on either side of the river grows the tree of life.
[88]  The Lord Jesus in Revelation 3 told the church in Laodicea that they were lukewarm, neither cold nor hot; so He must spew them out.
[89]  But if you are lukewarm, the Lord will spew you out.
[90]  We all must enjoy Christ, and we all must be enjoyable to Him in order to have the life fellowship with Him.
[91]  In the last chapter we saw that Revelation is a book of life.
[92]  In this chapter we will see that it is a book of praise.
[93]  He is not waiting for us to understand Him; He is waiting for us to breathe Him in. The more we say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! the more we breathe Him in. This is really good for our spirit, and it is really good for Him too.
[94]  We simply need to know how to exercise our spirit.
[95]  We must be assured that the Lord has turned the age from dead doctrines to the sevenfold living Spirit.
[96]  If you say that the church is poor, sooner or later you will lose the case.
[97]  We have seen that the book of Revelation is a book of the sevenfold intensified Spirit, a book of the local churches, a book of Christ, a book of life, and also a book of praise.
[98]  Another angel, a second one, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the fury of her fornication!
[99]  We do not care for Christianity, we do not care for Christendom, we do not care for the Roman Catholic Church, and we do not care for all the denominations, because the Bible says that the great Babylon is fallen.
[100]  We should not pray, O Lord, the war; Lord, the riots; Lord, the distresses; Lord, how prevailing is Catholicism; Lord, O Lord, do something Lord.
[101]  In the eyes of God everything has been accomplished.
[102]  Then how can we participate in all of this?
[103]  If we are going to participate and partake of all these things, we must realize the sevenfold intensified Spirit.
[104]  In the book of Revelation, He is not a small Christ, a gentle Christ, a kind Christ, a patient Christ, or a suffering Christ.
[105]  If we are in the seven Spirits, if we are in the local churches, and if we experience the different Christ, we will be so much in life.
