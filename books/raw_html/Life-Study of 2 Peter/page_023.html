<h1 class="series">LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND PETER</h1><h1 class="msg">MESSAGE EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE DIVINE PROVISION</h1><h1 class="title">(8)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Pet. 1:12-21</h1><p>After a word of introduction (1:1-2), Peter speaks concerning the divine provision (1:3-21). The divine provision includes two matters: the impartation of the divine power (1:3-11) and the shining of the divine truth (1:12-21). Regarding the impartation of the divine power, we have two main points: all things related to life and godliness with the divine nature (vv. 3-4) and the development by the growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom (vv. 5-11). Regarding the shining of the divine truth, there are also two main points: the glory of the apostles&rsquo; witnessing (vv. 12-18) and the light of the prophetic word (vv. 19-21). In this message we shall cover these two matters concerning the shining of the divine truth.</p><h2 class="head1">REMINDING THE SAINTS</h2><p>Second Peter 1:12 says, &ldquo;Wherefore I shall be ready always to remind you concerning these things, even though you know them and have been established in the present truth.&rdquo; By &ldquo;these things&rdquo; Peter means things such as the divine power, the things concerning life and godliness, the divine nature, and the development of the divine riches in our experience. Peter was always ready to remind the saints concerning these things, even though they had come to know them and had been established in the present truth, the truth which they already possessed.</p><p>By &ldquo;the present truth&rdquo; Peter means the truth which is present with the believers and which they have already received and now possess. In the first section of this chapter (vv. 1-11), Peter uses the provision of the divine life for the proper Christian life to inoculate against apostasy. In the second section (vv. 12-21), he uses the revelation of the divine truth, as the second antidote, to inoculate against the heresy in the apostasy, a heresy similar to today&rsquo;s Modernism.</p><p>In verses 13 and 14 Peter says, &ldquo;And I count it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder, knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is imminent, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;tabernacle&rdquo; refers to the temporal body (2 Cor. 5:1). To put off the tabernacle is to put off the body, to be unclothed of the body (2 Cor. 5:4), to leave the body, to die physically. Peter, like Paul (2 Tim. 4:6), knew that he would leave the world by martyrdom, and he was ready for this. He remembered the Lord&rsquo;s word to him concerning his death, when He charged him to feed His sheep (John 21:15-19).</p><p>In verse 15 Peter continues, &ldquo;And I will also be diligent, that after my exodus you may be able to have these things always in remembrance.&rdquo; By &ldquo;exodus&rdquo; or departure (the same Greek word is used in Luke 9:31), Peter means to leave the world. Once again, &ldquo;these things&rdquo; refer to what Peter has covered in 1:1-11.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT FOLLOWING CLEVERLY DEVISED MYTHS</h2><p>In verse 16 Peter goes on to say, &ldquo;For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we became eyewitnesses of that One&rsquo;s majesty.&rdquo; Myths were superstitious stories cleverly devised in Greek philosophy, which was related to the apostasy. The apostles preached and taught concerning the power and coming (Gk. <i>parousia,</i> presence) of the Lord Jesus Christ. To unbelievers, the preaching concerning the Lord&rsquo;s coming sounded very much like a myth or superstitious tale. But here Peter says that the apostles did not follow cleverly devised myths when they made known the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
