   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING ASHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After prophesying concerning Gad, Jacob spoke concerning Asher.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Genesis 49:20 says, Asher s food will be rich, / And he will yield royal dainties.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word rich literally means fat.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, Asher s bread is fat.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that his food is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This rich food even becomes royal dainties, the royal food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>X. CONCERNING NAPHTALI A. Being a Hind Let Loose</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 49:21 says, Naphtali is a hind let loose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a prophecy concerning the resurrected Christ as a hind let loose, skipping on the mountaintops.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing can frustrate Him, and no one needs to pave the way for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Giving Beautiful Words</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 21 also says, He gives beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The resurrected hind in Genesis 49 corresponds to the resurrected Lord in Matthew 28.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After Christ was risen, He gathered the disciples together and charged them, saying, Go therefore and disciple all the nations,...teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The disciples teaching all the nations all that the Lord commanded them was the giving of beautiful words.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CONCERNING JOSEPH A. Being a Fruitful Bough by a Fountain</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 49:22 says, Joseph is a fruitful bough, / A fruitful bough by a fountain; / His branches run over the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Joseph is a fruitful bough.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the fruitful tree must be Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jacob had twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Twelve is the number of eternal completion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The fact that Jacob had twelve sons shows that he was very fruitful; he was a fruitful tree.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His son Joseph was a bough of this tree and was also fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Joseph s father and eleven brothers and their families came down to Egypt, they became channels for the branching out of Joseph s fruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time in Egypt Joseph was not simply branching out personally; he was branching out God s administration with seventy people Exo 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, the entire world was under the branching out of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The picture of Joseph s fruitfulness and branching out is being fulfilled through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Acts 2 reveals the fruitfulness of Peter and the other eleven apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Throughout the centuries, all those who have loved the Lord and who have been occupied with Him have also been fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a fruitful person, Jacob signifies the producing God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is a fruitful tree.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is seen in John 15 where Christ, as the embodiment of God, is portrayed as a producing tree.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament Christ is also called a branch Isa 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, the Bible says that Christ is a tree, and on the other hand, it says that He is a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is both.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the embodiment of God, He is a tree, but as the branching out of God, He is a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Joseph, a type of Christ, as part of Jacob the fruitful father, was a bough of the fruitful tree and also a branch that branches out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>B. His Branches Running over the Wall</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Allegorically, Genesis 49:22 prophesies that Joseph will move out beyond the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Joseph was not limited to the good land; he ran over the wall into Egypt, spreading beyond the limits of the good land into another region.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In typology this indicates that the children of God are spreading Christ over every restriction and magnifying Him in every circumstance Phil 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A wall signifies restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since the day of Pentecost, wall after wall has been erected to restrict the spreading of the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day Peter was put into prison Acts 12:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But not even that stronghold could restrict the branching out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Year after year, decade after decade, and century after century, walls have been raised up by the opposers and by the enemy to restrict the fruitfulness of God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the branches run over the wall every time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>C. Being Helped by the God of His Father and Blessed by the All-sufficient One</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jacob prophesied that his God would help Joseph and that the All-sufficient One would bless him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Genesis 49:25 says, From the God of your father, who will help you, / And from the All-sufficient One, who will bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we combine the blessings mentioned in 49:25-26 with those in Deuteronomy 33:13-16, we see that there were ten aspects to the blessings bestowed upon Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First, he was blessed with the choicest things of heaven v. 13 . Certainly some of the blessings of the choicest things of heaven should include rain and snow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Second, he was blessed with the dew.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Third, he was blessed with the deep waters that couch beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This refers to the springs, fountains, and waters underneath the earth v. 13 . Fourth, he was blessed with the choicest of the crops of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Fifth, he had the blessing of the choicest of the yield of the moons v. 14 . The sixth blessing he received was the blessing of the top of the ancient mountains, and the seventh was the choicest things of the eternal hills v. 15 . In these blessings all of time and space is included.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From the ancient mountains to the eternal hills means that all time is included, and from heaven to earth, including the deep under the earth, means that all space is included.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This indicates that all the good things in the universe have become blessings to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The eighth blessing includes the choicest things of the earth and its fullness v. 16 . Certainly this must include minerals, such as gold and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The ninth blessing is seen in Genesis 49:25: Blessings of the breasts and of the womb.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This refers to the producing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the only blessing that is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The tenth blessing is the favor of Him who dwelt in the thornbush Deut 33:16; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Exo 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The One who dwelt in the bush dwelt in the temple; now He dwells in the church, and eventually, He will dwell in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the very desire of God s heart, His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All these things are included in the universal blessing bestowed upon Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All these blessings are the inheritance of Christ, typified by Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hebrews 1:2 says that God appointed Christ as Heir of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All the good things throughout time and space are the inheritance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is God s blessing to Christ, and Joseph represents Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All the blessings of the Father go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The New Testament says that all things have been given to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Because we are His partners, we join Him to inherit all these blessings Heb 3:14; Rom 8:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All the things in time from ancient times to eternity, everything in space from heaven to underneath the earth, and all the producing and nourishing aspects of life are the blessings bestowed upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ, typified by Joseph, was the One separate from His brothers Gen 49:26 , and as such, He has received the blessing of the whole universe.</S>
