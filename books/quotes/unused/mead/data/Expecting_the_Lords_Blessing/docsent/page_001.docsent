   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPECTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD'S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of late a thought has been constantly with me that all the work is dependent on God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Often we are faithful, but despite our faithfulness there is no blessing and no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Often we are diligent, but despite our diligence there is no blessing and no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Often we exercise our faith; we truly believe God can do something.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also pray that He would work, but everything is in vain when God does not bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sooner or later, we who serve God must be brought to the point of expecting God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without God's blessing, our faithfulness, diligence, faith, and prayers will be to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if we have God's blessing, there will be fruit even if we seem to be wrong or hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, all problems are a matter of God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would like to bring out the matter of multiplying the five loaves Mark 6:35-44; 8:1-9 with respect to God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a matter of how many loaves we have in our hands, but whether or not God has blessed them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if we had more than five loaves, this would not be enough to feed four or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if we had ten times or even one hundred times more, we still would not have enough to feed four or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not a matter of how much we have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sooner or later, we must be brought to the point of seeing that it is not a matter of what we can pull out of our storage shed, nor is it a matter of how great our gift is or how much power we have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The day must come in which we say to the Lord, "Everything depends on Your blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a basic matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How much blessing has the Lord really given us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It does not really matter how many loaves there are.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's blessing nourishes people and gives them life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One matter is troubling my heart: Do we truly treasure God's blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a basic question concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps we do not even have five loaves today, but our need is greater than four thousand or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am afraid that we have less in our storehouse than the apostles, while our need is greater than the need at the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our own store, source, power, labor, and faithfulness will be manifest that they are useless to us one day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers, our future holds great disappointment for us because we will see that we can do nothing.</S>
