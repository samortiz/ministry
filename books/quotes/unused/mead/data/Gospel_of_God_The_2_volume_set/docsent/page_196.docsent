   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON GALATIANS 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Galatians 5:4 says, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When many read this verse, they think that, first, one can be separated from Christ, and second, one can fall from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a one is surely not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This understanding is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to realize the background in which Paul wrote the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the clear gospel of God was preached to Galatia, the people there heard it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After this, false prophets came to Galatia to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did not change the first half of the gospel; they changed the second half.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first half said that man was saved only by trusting in Christ and receiving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the second half said that before one believes in the Lord Jesus, he cannot have the righteousness from the law; but after one receives the Lord Jesus, he should have the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul wrote the book of Galatians just to refute them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He argued that as a man cannot have the righteousness of the law while he is yet a sinner, in the same way, he cannot have the righteousness of the law after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen in the previous few messages that Romans and Galatians are different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans says that while we are sinners, we cannot have the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Galatians says that after a sinner is saved, he still cannot have the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The subject of both books is not having the righteousness which is of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These ones taught that after a man has believed in Christ, is saved, and has eternal life, he has to have the righteousness of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first thing and the minimum requirement of the righteousness of the law is circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After you are clear about the background of this book, you will know what Galatians is speaking of here.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In chapter one Paul said that he marveled that the Galatians were so quickly removing from Him who had called them in the grace of Christ to a different gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He marveled that they were so quickly deceived to follow another gospel v. 6 . He also said that if he, an angel, or any spirit came and preached to them a gospel different from what they had received, they should be anathematized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word anathematize is the strongest word of curse in the Greek language.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It means that all the curse in heaven falls on the cursed one and that all the blessings are withheld.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul said that his gospel was revealed to him by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He received it in the wilderness of Arabia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the reason that his gospel could not contain any mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Galatians 2 tells us what this gospel is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this chapter Peter pretended.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he saw the Jews coming in from James vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>11-12 , he maintained himself as a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul rebuked him to his face.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Circumcision means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ has already died.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is no longer we who live, but Christ who lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Chapter three tells us that God's goal is not the law but the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason that God gave man the law was to cause man first to know his sin and then to accept the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Chapter four brings out two other things to show us that it is useless for man to keep the law even if he is able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hagar represents the law, and Sarah represents grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hagar must go before Sarah can remain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if you can keep the law, you are just Hagar, and you still have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first sentence in chapter five is, "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ has brought us into freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must now stand firm in this freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not lose this freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a man keeps circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the system of the law is retained, Christ will have to be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One cannot keep the law a little and then ask Christ to make up the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ never does this kind of piecemeal work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, Paul said, "And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law" 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why would some not choose other things in the law?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Why would some only pick up the matter of circumcision?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why would they only pick up what they liked and not keep the whole law?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If they wanted to keep one item of the law, they would also have to keep the entire law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If one stays, all have to stay.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They cannot choose one and reject all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 4 says, "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be brought to nought from Christ means the same thing as Christ profiting nothing at the end of verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seems as if Christ is not expressed in you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You do not have forgiveness, joy, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, if you follow the law, Christ will be brought to nought in you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Here, it is not a matter of receiving salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is speaking of the condition to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose a brother comes to me and says, "Mr. Nee, I should keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If I do not keep the Sabbath, my salvation will not be complete."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I know that this brother is indeed saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no question about it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now that he has received such a wrong teaching, I must tell him, "If you keep the Sabbath, the work of Christ will have no effect on you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is of faith that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Now you have gone back to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You have fallen from grace."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, it is not a question of salvation or perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a matter of the condition for being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It shows us that a man is saved by Christ and not by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a man keeps the law, there will be no grace.</S>
