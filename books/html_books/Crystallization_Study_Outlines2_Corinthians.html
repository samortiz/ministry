<h1 class="title">The Constitution of the New Covenant Ministry</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:6; 4:1; 1:3-22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ministry is based upon God&rsquo;s covenants&mdash;the old covenant and the new covenant&mdash;3:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A ministry is to carry out what God has covenanted with His people; without God&rsquo;s covenant, it is impossible to have any ministry, and whatever we do cannot be considered a ministry.</li>
	<li>The ministry is the service that we render to God to carry out God&rsquo;s covenant.</li>
	<li>Based upon the new covenant of the New Testament, there is the ministry of the new covenant, which is uniquely one&mdash;Jer. 31:31-34; Matt. 26:28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20; 2 Cor. 3:6; 4:1; Acts 1:17.</li>
	<li>Whatever we may do to carry out our own preferences or desires is not a ministry of God but is merely a human work.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 1 Corinthians the gifts are covered as a major subject, but in 2 Corinthians the gifts are replaced by the ministry&mdash;4:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The ministry is to minister the Christ whom we have experienced (1:3-4); the church needs the ministry much more than the gifts.</li>
	<li>The ministry is constituted with, and produced and formed by, the experiences of the riches of Christ through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross&mdash;vv. 3-8; 4:8-12.</li>
	<li>Second Corinthians gives us a pattern, an example, of how the killing of the cross works, how Christ is wrought into our being, and how we become the expression of Christ; these processes constitute the ministers of Christ and produce the ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant.</li>
	<li>The ministry produced and formed by the experience of the sufferings, the afflictions, of Christ is the proof that the apostles are ministers of Christ&mdash;Acts 9:15-16; Col. 1:24; Phil. 3:10.</li>
	<li>The ministry comes out by the working of the cross; it is by the way of the cross that we have the riches of Christ to minister to others&mdash;2 Cor. 4:12.</li>
	<li>The ministry is produced by the experiences of the anointing Spirit as the anointing, the sealing, and the pledge, with the experience of the cross&mdash;1:21-22.</li>
	<li>Ministry is a matter of being constituted with grace through experiences of suffering&mdash;v. 12; 12:9; 1 Cor. 15:10; 1 Tim. 1:14; 2 Tim. 1:9; 2:1.</li>
	<li>The constituting of a ministry depends upon the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ministry of the new covenant is produced by revelation plus suffering&mdash;12:1, 7; 1:3-5, 8-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Epistles of Paul we see three things&mdash;revelation, suffering, and ministry&mdash;Eph. 3:5; Rom. 16:25; Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:24; 2 Cor. 4:1.</li>
	<li>The revelation we receive is burned into our being through suffering.</li>
	<li>How much life and how much reality of the riches of Christ we can minister depends upon two elements&mdash; how much revelation we have received and how much we have suffered for what has been revealed to us.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>A ministry is the expression of what we are&mdash;vv. 1, 5; 2:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul himself was what he ministered because what he had seen was wrought into his being; thus, he ministered what he was.</li>
	<li>What Paul had was a ministry, and that ministry was what he was&mdash;4:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ministers of the new covenant experience God as the God of resurrection&mdash;1:8-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Resurrection is the very God, who resurrects the dead&mdash; John 11:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The working of the cross terminates our self so that we may experience God in resurrection.</li>
		<li>The experience of the cross always issues in the enjoyment of the God of resurrection.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ministers of the new covenant have the response, or answer, of death in themselves that they should not base their confidence on themselves but on God, who raises the dead&mdash;2 Cor. 1:9; 3:5; 4:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is working through the cross to terminate us, to bring us to an end.</li>
		<li>Once we have been brought to an end, we will no longer trust in ourselves but will trust in the God of resurrection.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our God is the God of the first day of the week&mdash;1 Cor. 16:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first day of the week is a sign that the Triune God has been processed in resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit&mdash;15:45b.</li>
		<li>In the church life, everything we do must be on the first day of the week; this means that everything must be done in resurrection.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our natural ability must be dealt with by the cross and brought into resurrection&mdash;Matt. 16:24; Phil. 3:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Natural ability acts on its own, not according to God&rsquo;s will, and seeks its own glory and satisfies its own desire.</li>
		<li>After our natural ability has been dealt with by the cross, it becomes useful in resurrection for our service to the Lord.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live in resurrection is to conduct ourselves in the &ldquo;singleness and sincerity of God&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 1:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The apostles&rsquo; situation forced them to be simple, that is, not to base their confidence on their natural human ability to work out a solution to their difficult situation.</li>
		<li>Being single and simple is an expression of the life in resurrection; only when we live in resurrection and by the God of resurrection are we simple.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live in resurrection is to conduct ourselves &ldquo;not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God&rdquo;&mdash;v. 12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Just as fleshly wisdom equals ourselves, so the grace of God equals God Himself&mdash;God for our enjoyment&mdash; 12:9; 1 Cor. 15:10.</li>
		<li>The resurrected Christ is given to the new covenant ministers as grace, enabling them to enjoy the experience of resurrection out of death.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ministers of the new covenant experience, in resurrection, a mysterious transfer out of &ldquo;Tyre&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; into the tribe of &ldquo;Naphtali&rdquo;&mdash;2 Chron. 2:14; 1 Kings 7:14; Gen. 49:21; Hab. 3:19; Psa. 22 (title):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A hind signifies a person who trusts in God when he is in a desperate situation and who lives in resurrection for God&rsquo;s building.</li>
		<li>Our life and our being should not only be transformed but also transferred so that we are absolutely of &ldquo;Naphtali.&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">How the Ministers of the New Covenant<br />
and Their Ministry Are Constituted,<br />
How They Behave and Live,<br />
and How Their Ministry Is Carried Out</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 2:10, 12&mdash;3:3</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ministers of the new covenant are captives in a triumphal procession for the celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory&mdash;2 Cor. 2:12-14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul uses the metaphor of a procession held in honor of the victory of a Roman general to illustrate what he was in the ministry&mdash;v. 14.</li>
	<li>Paul and his co-workers had been conquered by Christ and had become His captives in the train of His triumph, celebrating His victory; therefore, Paul&rsquo;s ministry was a triumphal procession of the victorious General, the Lord Jesus, leading many captives&mdash;Eph. 4:8; Col. 1:18b.</li>
	<li>As such captives, we are witnesses that once we were enemies of Christ, but we have been defeated, subdued, captured, and made submissive to Him:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In our experience much of the time we must admit that instead of being captives to Christ, Christ is a captive to us&mdash;cf. Acts 26:14.</li>
		<li>A captive of Christ is daily conquered, defeated, and captured by Christ; for this we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, make me Your captive. Never let me win. Defeat me all the time.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>A captive of Christ lives and serves in the spirit&mdash; 2 Cor. 2:13; Rom. 1:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>A captive of Christ cares for the rest in his spirit, not for the outward circumstances or environment&mdash;2 Cor. 2:12-13; cf. 7:5-6.</li>
			<li>A captive of Christ exercises his spirit of faith&mdash; 4:13.</li>
			<li>A captive of Christ is renewed day by day in the inner man&mdash;v. 16.</li>
			<li>A captive of Christ serves in a holy spirit&mdash;6:4, 6; 7:1.</li>
			<li>A captive of Christ is refreshed in his spirit to refresh others&rsquo; spirits&mdash;1 Cor. 16:18; 2 Cor. 7:13.</li>
			<li>The captives of Christ walk in the same spirit&mdash; 12:18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>A captive of Christ is a person in the spirit, doing everything in the person of Christ, the face of Christ&mdash;2:10; cf. 4:6:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>A captive of Christ enjoys the changelessness of Christ&mdash;1:17-20.</li>
			<li>A captive of Christ enjoys the meekness and gentleness of Christ&mdash;10:1.</li>
			<li>A captive of Christ enjoys the truthfulness of Christ&mdash;11:10.</li>
			<li>A captive of Christ enjoys the grace of Christ and the power of Christ&mdash;12:9-10.</li>
			<li>A captive of Christ enjoys Christ speaking in him&mdash;13:3-5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>A captive of Christ is a lover of the church&mdash;2:12-13; 11:28-29; 12:14-15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ministers of the new covenant are incense-bearers to scatter the fragrance of Christ&mdash;2:14b-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As captives of Christ in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession, we are simultaneously incense-bearers; through us God manifests the savor of the knowledge of Christ in every place&mdash;v. 14.</li>
	<li>Actually, to scatter the incense of Christ is to live Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
	<li>Because we have been captured, subdued, possessed, and gained by Christ, He has the liberty to saturate us to make us a fragrance of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 2:15.</li>
	<li>The ministers of Christ, the lovers of Christ, are prepared to give forth Christ&rsquo;s fragrance in all circumstances and in any kind of environment&mdash;S. S. 4:10-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All problems come from within, not from without.</li>
		<li>If there is a fragrance inside, outward circumstances will only serve to bring out the smell of the fragrance&mdash;Phil. 4:11-12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The scattering of Christ as fragrant incense has an effect; it is a matter of life or death&mdash;2 Cor. 2:16.</li>
	<li>Those who scatter the fragrance of Christ are not like the many, adulterating the word of God for profit; but they speak out of sincerity, out of God, before God, and in Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ&mdash; v. 17; cf. 13:3.</li>
	<li>As incense-bearers scattering the fragrance of Christ, we are the ambassadors of Christ&mdash;5:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We do not live by what we are or can do but by the immortal life, which is Christ Himself&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		<li>We are determined to gain the honor of being well pleasing to Christ&mdash;v. 9.</li>
		<li>We are constrained by the love of Christ&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>We know others according to Christ in the spirit&mdash; v. 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ministers of the new covenant are letters written with Christ as the content to convey and express Christ&mdash;3:1-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is written into every part of our inner being with the Spirit of the living God to make us His living letters, that He may be expressed, read, and known by others in us&mdash;vv. 2-3; cf. Eph. 3:17a.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not the instrument, like a pen, but the element, like ink used in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19; cf. Exo. 30:23-25.</li>
	<li>The heavenly, compound ink is the compound Spirit, the essence of this Spirit-ink is Christ with all His riches, and we are the pen; to have this ink in our experience we must enjoy and be thoroughly saturated with Christ as the life-giving Spirit; then we will spontaneously minister Christ to those whom we contact, making them living letters of Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19; 2 Cor. 3:3, 6.</li>
	<li>On the one hand, the believers were the letter of Christ; on the other hand, they were the letter of the apostles inscribed in their hearts&mdash;vv. 2-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>While we are ministering Christ to others, Christ is simultaneously written in the ones to whom we are ministering and also in us.</li>
		<li>The one writing produces two original copies of the one letter; one copy is in our heart, and the other copy is in the heart of the ones to whom we are ministering.</li>
		<li>They become a letter of Christ, and this letter is also written in us, the writers; such a ministry involves two hearts becoming one.</li>
		<li>We can never forget the ones to whom we have ministered Christ and the ones who have ministered Christ to us&mdash;7:3.</li>

and How Their Ministry Is Carried Out</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:16, 18&mdash;4:1, 6-7</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ministers of the new covenant are mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image&mdash;2 Cor. 3:16, 18&mdash;4:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Whenever our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away from our heart, and we can behold the Lord of glory with an unveiled face&mdash;3:16, 18.</li>
	<li>Actually, our turned-away heart is the veil; to turn our heart to the Lord is to take away the veil.</li>
	<li>An unveiled face is an unveiled heart to behold the glory of the Lord&mdash;vv. 16, 18; 1 Sam. 16:7; Eph. 1:18a.</li>
	<li>The glory of God is in the face of Christ, and His face, His person, is the indwelling treasure in our spirit&mdash; 2 Cor. 4:6-7; 1 Pet. 3:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are earthen vessels who are worthless and fragile, but within our spirit we contain a priceless treasure, the face, the person, of Christ Himself&mdash; 2 Cor. 2:10; 4:6-7.</li>
		<li>In the whole universe, there is nothing so precious as to behold the face of Jesus&mdash;Gen. 32:30; Exo. 25:30; 33:11; Psa. 27:4, 8; Rev. 22:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It is only when we are living in His presence, looking at the index of His being, that we sense that He is such a treasure to us.</li>
			<li>Seeing God equals gaining God, which is to receive God in His element into us to transform us&mdash;Job 42:5-6.</li>
			<li>The very God whom we look at today is the consummated Spirit, and we can look at Him in our spirit to absorb the riches of God into our being and be under the divine transformation day by day&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18b; Matt. 14:22-23; Col. 4:2:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>(1) The glory of the Lord is the resurrected Christ as the Lord Spirit.</li>
				<li>(2) <em>From glory to glory</em> means &ldquo;from the Lord Spirit to the Lord Spirit&rdquo;; this means that the Lord Spirit as the rich supply is continually added into our being.</li>
				<li>(3) As we open to the Lord, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our being to infuse His life essence into us, to operate within us by His life power, and to shape us into His image.</li>
				<li>(4) If you have some problem, you just need to tell Him; He is right within you, and He is with you face to face&mdash;Phil. 4:6.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Beholding is to see the Lord ourselves; reflecting is to enable others to see Him through us&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18&mdash;4:1; Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
		<li>As we turn our heart to the Lord in our spirit to behold Him face to face and to reflect Him for others to see, we are in the process of being transformed into His glorious image unto the day when &ldquo;we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is&rdquo;&mdash;1 John 3:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Transformation is not an outward change or correction but a spiritual metabolism; it is the metabolic function of the life of God in the believers:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Metabolism includes three matters:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>First, the supplying of a new element.</li>
			<li>Second, the replacing of the old element with the new element.</li>
			<li>Third, the discharge, or removal, of the old element so that something new may be produced&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As we receive the Lord as the new element into us, a spiritual metabolism takes place within us to be expressed outwardly in the image of Christ, manifesting the metabolism in life.</li>
		<li>Only that which is expressed outwardly through the inward metabolism is genuine health and real beauty&mdash;Exo. 28:2; Psa. 90:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ministers of the new covenant are earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure&mdash;2 Cor. 4:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>These vessels are like today&rsquo;s camera, into which Christ the figure enters through the flash of God&rsquo;s shining&mdash; vv. 6-7.</li>
	<li>Christ as the priceless treasure is contained in us, the worthless and fragile vessels; this makes the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry&mdash;v. 7; cf. Gen. 4:26.</li>
	<li>This treasure, the indwelling Christ, in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine supply and power for the Christian life; God&rsquo;s power is manifested in man&rsquo;s weakness, and man&rsquo;s weakness cannot limit God&rsquo;s power&mdash;2 Cor. 4:7; 12:10.</li>
	<li>The new covenant ministers are Christ&rsquo;s chosen vessels to contain and express Him&mdash;Acts 9:15; cf. Dan. 5:2-3, 23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We are vessels containing Christ as mercy&mdash;Rom. 9:16, 23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We were chosen by God according to His sovereign mercy; it is altogether a matter of mercy that we are believers and that we are in the church life&mdash;vv. 11-16, 20-21.</li>
			<li>The goal of God&rsquo;s selection in His sovereign mercy is to have many vessels to contain Him and eternally express Him; this is the climax of our usefulness to God&mdash;v. 21.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We are vessels containing Christ as honor&mdash;v. 21:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We are vessels unto honor through our cleansing ourselves from the vessels unto dishonor&mdash; 2 Tim. 2:20-21.</li>
			<li>We are vessels unto honor by being filled with Christ as the Spirit to honor God and by ministering Christ as the Spirit to honor man&mdash;Judg. 9:9; cf. John 7:37-39a.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We are vessels containing Christ as glory&mdash;Rom. 9:23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Instead of living by our life with our nature to express ourselves, we must live by the Father&rsquo;s life with His nature to express Him; this is glory, and in this glory we all are one&mdash;John 17:22-24.</li>
			<li>We have been prepared by God unto glory through glorification&mdash;the last step of God&rsquo;s full salvation&mdash;Rom. 8:21, 23, 30; Phil. 3:21.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Function of the New Covenant Ministry<br />
and<br />
the Spirit of a New Covenant Minister</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:1-6; 2:13; 6:6; 12:18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The function of the new covenant ministry is to write living letters of Christ with the life-giving Spirit&mdash; 2 Cor. 3:1-6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The believers became the apostles&rsquo; letters of commendation, written by the apostles with Christ as the content in every part of their being&mdash;vv. 1-2.</li>
	<li>Because the apostles were filled with Christ, in their ministry they spontaneously ministered Christ to others, inscribing Christ into them.</li>
	<li>When the apostles preached Christ or ministered Christ, they ministered Him into the spirits and hearts of the believers&mdash;v. 3; Eph. 3:17a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>First, Christ as the life-giving Spirit is ministered into our spirit; this means that Christ is written in our spirit.</li>
		<li>By further ministry Christ spreads from our spirit into our mind, emotion, and will:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Eventually, Christ will be written into every part of our inward being.</li>
			<li>This is actually Christ making His home in our heart&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a.</li>
			<li>Christ making His home in our heart equals the writing of Christ throughout our inner being.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The writing that takes place in our hearts by the ministers of the new covenant has the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the element&mdash;2 Cor. 3:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This element is actually the processed God; thus, it is the Triune God who is being written into us&mdash; 13:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
		<li>The ministers of the new covenant write letters with the processed Triune God as the element.</li>
		<li>The heavenly ink is the Spirit, and the essence of this Spirit-ink is Christ with all His riches; to have this ink in our experience, we must enjoy Christ, possess Christ, be filled with Christ, be saturated with Christ, and be covered with Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:3; Gal. 1:15a, 16a; 2:20; 4:19; Eph. 3:8, 16-17a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The only One qualified to do the work of writing living letters of Christ is God&mdash;2 Cor. 3:5-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The living God Himself is the sufficiency, competency, and qualification of the apostles&rsquo; ministry for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy to dispense Christ into God&rsquo;s chosen people for the building up of the Body&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>Only the Triune God constituted into us is sufficient to carry on the work of writing letters of Christ&mdash; v. 6.</li>
		<li>God is writing Himself into His chosen people; the Writer is God, the writing substance is God, and the issue, the result, is also God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The writing of living letters of Christ involves both dispensing and constituting:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>With respect to the One doing the writing, it is a matter of dispensing&mdash;13:14.</li>
		<li>With respect to the one being written upon, it is a matter of constituting&mdash;a constituting that takes place through the divine dispensing&mdash;Eph. 3:16-17a; Gal. 4:19.</li>
		<li>Spiritual letter writing involves the dispensing of the Divine Trinity; this dispensing results in constituting, and the issue of this dispensing and constituting is that we become letters of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To preach the gospel is to write a living letter; gospel preaching is a matter of letter writing&mdash;2 Cor. 10:14, 16; cf. 4:3-4.</li>
	<li>The inscribing of Christ into others is not for our work; it is for the church so that God&rsquo;s administration may be carried out and His eternal purpose may be fulfilled&mdash; 1 Cor. 14:4-5, 12; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 4:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The spirit of a new covenant minister is exemplified by the spirit of Paul:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 2 Corinthians we see that Paul&rsquo;s spirit is:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>An open spirit&mdash;6:11-13.</li>
		<li>A holy spirit&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		<li>A frank spirit&mdash;10:7-12; 11:5-31; 12:11.</li>
		<li>A pure spirit&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>A bold spirit&mdash;7:4, 16; 10:11; 13:2.</li>
		<li>A humble spirit&mdash;10:1; 12:21.</li>
		<li>A loving spirit&mdash;vv. 15, 19.</li>
		<li>A tender spirit&mdash;7:3-4b.</li>
		<li>A spirit that is not self-seeking&mdash;2:13; 7:2; 12:14, 17.</li>
		<li>A coordinating spirit&mdash;v. 18; 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Since our spirit has been joined to the Lord as one spirit, our spirit should be the predominant part of our being; first, our spirit becomes the spirit of our mind, and eventually, the spirit of our body&mdash;1 Cor. 6:15-20; Eph. 4:23.</li>
	<li>In order to have the spirit of a new covenant minister, we need to:

<h1 class="title">The Essence and Glory of the New Covenant Ministry</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:7-11, 18; 4:4, 6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The new covenant ministry has an essence in two aspects&mdash;the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness&mdash;2 Cor. 3:8-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit who gives life (vv. 8, 6), because the new covenant brings in God&rsquo;s righteousness unto life (Rom. 5:18, 21); hence, the new covenant ministry is also a ministry of righteousness.</li>
	<li>As the old covenant ministry was of death and condemnation, so the new covenant ministry is of the Spirit and of righteousness; death is versus life, which is embodied in the Spirit, and condemnation is versus righteousness.</li>
	<li>The Spirit and righteousness are the two aspects of an essence which is inscribed into us by the ministry of the new covenant; this Spirit and this righteousness are the essence of the new covenant ministry&mdash;2 Cor. 3:8-9.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s view of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3 is that of an essence used for inscribing letters of Christ&mdash;vv. 2-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As indicated by <em>with</em> in verse 3, the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God, is an essence used in the writing.</li>
		<li>A divine essence has been written into our being, and this essence is the Spirit:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The unique essence which needs to be inscribed into the saints is the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</li>
			<li>The new covenant ministry inscribes the Spirit into us, that is, this ministry adds more of the essence of God into us.</li>
			<li>The essence of the Spirit inscribed into us is life&mdash;v. 6; 4:12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Based upon the principle that the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 3 is an essence, righteousness is also an essence&mdash; v. 9; 5:21.</li>
	<li>The ministry of the new covenant inscribes an essence into our being, an essence that has an inner aspect and an outer aspect; the inner aspect is the living Spirit moving in us, and the outer aspect is righteousness as our expression&mdash;3:3, 8-9.</li>
	<li>The goal of the new covenant ministry is to minister Christ as the life-giving Spirit inwardly and as the living righteousness outwardly.</li>
	<li>The Spirit and righteousness are both related to our expressing the image of God (v. 18); the reason for this is that the Spirit and righteousness are both God Himself:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The central vision of the Bible is related to the image of God expressed by the life of God&mdash;Gen. 1:26; 2:9; Rev. 4:3; 21:10-11; 22:1-2, 14.</li>
		<li>God as the Spirit is moving in us as a substance and living in us as an essence, for He Himself has been added into our being by the new covenant ministry.</li>
		<li>The righteousness we express outwardly is also God Himself, for we have God as our righteousness, and this righteousness becomes our appearance, our expression.</li>
		<li>Righteousness is the outward expression of the Christ who lives in us as the life-giving Spirit:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This righteousness is God&rsquo;s image&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10.</li>
			<li>The new covenant ministry is a ministry of the Lord&rsquo;s image&mdash;2 Cor. 3:9, 18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To say that the ministry of the new covenant is a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness is equal to saying that the new covenant ministry is a ministry of God&mdash; vv. 8-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit is God within us living, moving, and acting, and righteousness is God expressed to become our appearance outwardly.</li>
		<li>Since the Spirit inwardly and the righteousness outwardly are God Himself, the ministry of the new covenant, a ministry of the Spirit and of righteousness, is a ministry of God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Whereas the old covenant ministry came about in glory and was through glory, the new covenant ministry is in glory and abounds in glory&mdash;vv. 7-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 3:7-11 we see the inferiority of the glory of the Mosaic ministry, the ministry of the old covenant, a ministry of condemnation and death, and the superiority of the apostolic ministry, a ministry of righteousness and the Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The glory of the new covenant ministry is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God shining Himself in the hearts of the apostles&mdash; v. 8; 4:6.</li>
		<li>With the old covenant ministry, there was glorification; with the new covenant ministry, there is the glory itself, even the surpassing glory&mdash;3:10.</li>
		<li>The apostolic ministry of the new covenant not only has glory but also abounds with the glory of God&mdash; v. 9.</li>
		<li>The glory of the new covenant ministry does not come to visit us&mdash;it comes to remain in us and to shine out from within our being; this glory comes first to invade, pervade, permeate, soak, and saturate us and then to shine forth from within us&mdash;4:4, 6; 3:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The glory of the new covenant ministry is the resurrected Christ&mdash;Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The resurrected Christ is Himself the glory of the new covenant&mdash;John 7:39; 17:1, 5; Luke 24:26; Acts 3:13; Rom. 6:4.</li>
		<li>Glory, which is an essence, is intimately related to the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The glory in verse 18 is equal to the Lord Spirit; thus, the glory actually is the Spirit.</li>
			<li>Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit&mdash; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
			<li>The glory of the new covenant, being the resurrected Christ, is the Spirit.</li>
			<li>The glory, the Spirit, and resurrection all refer to the same thing.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&mdash;the glory of the new covenant ministry&mdash;is now shining in us all&mdash;2 Cor. 4:4, 6.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Constitution of the New Covenant Ministers</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:12-18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ministers of the new covenant are constituted by and with the Lord as the life-giving and transforming Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:12-18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The new covenant ministers are persons whose hearts have turned to the Lord, whose faces are unveiled, who are enjoying the Lord as the Spirit, freeing them from the bondage of the law, and who are being transformed into the image of the Lord by beholding and reflecting Him&mdash;vv. 16-18.</li>
	<li>Through such a process of transformation they are constituted ministers of Christ by the Spirit with the elements of Christ&rsquo;s person and work:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>What we are by nature means nothing; only what the Spirit constitutes within our being counts.</li>
		<li>We are transformed into precious stones through the heat and pressure in our environment and through the flowing and dispensing of the Spirit within us&mdash; v. 18; 4:16-18; Rom. 12:2a; 1 Cor. 3:12a.</li>
		<li>Hence, our person is constituted of and with Christ, and our ministry is to minister Christ to others, infusing them with the all-inclusive Christ as the indwelling, life-giving Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:5-6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to be constituted as the ministers of the new covenant for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to experience all the aspects of the all-inclusive Spirit in 2 Corinthians:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The anointing Spirit is the indwelling, compound Spirit moving and working within us to impart all of God&rsquo;s divine ingredients and constituents into us&mdash;1:21; Phil. 1:19; Rom. 10:12-13; cf. Exo. 30:23-25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The reaching of the anointing accomplishes the central purpose of God&rsquo;s salvation to anoint the compounded God into us that we may be united, mingled, and incorporated with Him&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 1 John 2:20, 27.</li>
		<li>The teaching of the anointing is the inward feeling generated by the moving of the Spirit within us, enabling us to know God&rsquo;s mind and to live in Him, teaching us the things concerning the Triune God and His activities&mdash;v. 27; Acts 16:6-7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The sealing Spirit forms the divine elements into an impression to express God&rsquo;s image&mdash;2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The sealing Spirit saturates the believers continuously unto the redemption of their body&mdash;4:30.</li>
		<li>The sealing Spirit transforms the believers into a treasure to God as His inheritance&mdash;1:11.</li>
		<li>The more we are sealed, the more we bear the image of God to be constituted into the masterpiece of God&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18b; Eph. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The pledging Spirit gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God&mdash;2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit&rsquo;s pledging guarantees that God is our inheritance&mdash;Eph. 1:14.</li>
		<li>Christ as the pledging Spirit is in us for our taste, for our enjoyment of Him as our divine inheritance, our allotted portion, through the exercise of our spirit&mdash;Psa. 34:8; 1 Pet. 2:3; Col. 1:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The inscribing Spirit writes Christ into us to make us the living letters of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 3:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ is being inscribed into us with the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God; if we are under the Spirit&rsquo;s inscribing, we have the deep sensation of being living within.</li>
		<li>The Spirit is the ink, and the content of the ink is Christ with His person, work, and attainments; the compound Spirit as the compound ink adds the substance of Christ into us and saturates us with the essence of Christ.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The life-giving Spirit, the vivifying Spirit, imparts the divine life into our being to make us men of life with the ministry of life&mdash;vv. 6, 17; John 7:38:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we study and read the Bible prayerfully with the exercise of our spirit, we are vivified&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6; John 6:63.</li>
		<li>To be one who can give life to others, we must abide in the divine life and walk, live, and have our being in the divine life&mdash;1 John 5:16a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ministering Spirit imparts all that Christ is into us and makes all that Christ is and has real to us&mdash;2 Cor. 3:8; John 16:13-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We can receive the supply of the ministering Spirit by exercising our spirit to pray and call on the Lord&mdash;Gal. 3:5a; Col. 4:2; Rom. 10:12-13.</li>
		<li>The ministering Spirit ministers Christ into us and ministers Christ to others through us&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6; cf. Phil. 1:25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The freeing Spirit frees us from the bondage of the letter of the law; the Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself, with whom is freedom&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17; 4:5; Gal. 2:4; 5:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This freeing includes full satisfaction, with a rich, supporting supply and the full enjoyment of Christ&mdash; John 4:14b.</li>
		<li>This freeing includes the enjoyment of true rest, without being under the heavy burden to keep the law&mdash;Matt. 11:28-30.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The transforming Spirit dispenses the divine life, nature, essence, element&mdash;even the divine being&mdash;into us so that we may be metabolically changed in our inner being&mdash; 2 Cor. 3:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we turn our hearts to the Lord to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done.</li>
		<li>Thus, we are being transformed metabolically from one degree of glory to another degree of glory to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The transmitting Spirit transmits all that Christ is with all the riches of God into us for our participation&mdash;13:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is love, and this love is being transmitted as grace into us by the Spirit, who is the Transmitter.</li>
		<li>The Spirit is the fellowship, the communication, the circulation, the transmission, of the grace of Christ with the love of the Father, transmitting the divine riches into our being for our enjoyment.</li>

for the Manifestation of the Resurrection Life<br />
by the Excellent Power of the Treasure<br />
in the Earthen Vessels</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 4:7-18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Second Corinthians 3 and 4 are an accurate and precious record of Paul&rsquo;s spiritual constitution:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>What the apostles ministered was their constitution; they ministered what they were, what they had become&mdash;cf. Phil. 1:20-21a.</li>
	<li>This means that their reconstituted being became their ministry&mdash;cf. Acts 20:18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The indwelling Christ as the treasure in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply for the Christian life and the excellent power for us to live a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life&mdash;2 Cor. 4:7; Phil. 4:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul said that he and his co-workers &ldquo;were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living...that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 1:8-9.</li>
	<li>Actually, resurrection requires death, discouragement, and disappointment in order to be manifested&mdash;v. 4; 7:5-6.</li>
	<li>The working of the cross terminates our self that we may enjoy the God of resurrection; such experience produces and forms the ministry&mdash;1:4-6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The apostles lived the resurrection life under the killing of the cross, for the carrying out of their ministry:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body&rdquo;&mdash;4:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus, in a positive sense, is always killing all the negative things within us in order to heal and enliven us&mdash;Phil 1:19; cf. Exo. 30:23-25.</li>
		<li>When we reject ourselves in the morning to receive God into us, we have the sense during the day that a killing process is going on within us&mdash;cf. Prov. 4:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of the resurrection life; this daily killing is for the release of the divine life in resurrection&mdash;1 Cor. 15:31; 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
		<li>The title <em>Jesus</em> implies that the apostles lived a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on earth; the Lord&rsquo;s life was a life under the killing of the cross for the manifestation of the resurrection life, a life lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry and His life was His ministry&mdash;John 6:14-15; 12:13, 19, 23-24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;So then death operates in us, but life in you&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we are under the killing of the Lord&rsquo;s death, His resurrection life is imparted through us into others&mdash;cf. Josh. 3:17.</li>
		<li>The way for the church to come into being and to increase is not by human glory; it is by the death of the cross for the release of the fire of the divine life&mdash;Luke 12:49-50; John 2:19; 12:24-26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord, as a grain of wheat that fell into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains.</li>
			<li>As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>It is by the spirit of faith that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for the carrying out of their ministry&mdash;2 Cor. 4:13; 5:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must exercise our mingled spirit, the spirit of faith, to believe and to speak, like the psalmist (Psa. 116:10a), the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection.</li>
	<li>Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind; doubts are in our mind&mdash;cf. Heb. 11:6.</li>
	<li>Through the exercise of our spirit of faith, we regard the unseen things of eternal glory, not the seen things of temporary affliction&mdash;2 Cor. 4:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Christian life is a life of things unseen&mdash;Heb. 11:1.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover His church from things seen to things unseen&mdash;v. 27; 1 Pet. 1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The outer man consists of the body as its organ with the soul as its life and person; the inner man consists of the regenerated spirit as its life and person with the renewed soul as its organ.</li>
	<li>In order to live a crucified life, the life of the soul must be denied (Matt. 16:24-25), but the functions of the soul&mdash;the mind, will, and emotion&mdash;must be renewed and uplifted by being subdued (2 Cor. 10:4-5) so that they can be used by the spirit, the person of the inner man.</li>
	<li>Our outer man is being consumed and worn out, but our inner man is being daily renewed by being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Christian life is a life of being renewed day by day with the divine element through the process of sufferings&mdash;1 Thes. 3:3; Jer. 48:11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We are renewed by the cross, the Holy Spirit, our mingled spirit, and the word of God&mdash;2 Cor. 4:10; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23; 5:26.</li>
			<li>We need to be revived every morning&mdash;Matt. 13:43; Prov. 4:18.</li>
			<li>We should come to the Lord&rsquo;s table in the principle of newness by forgiving others and seeking to be forgiven&mdash;Matt. 26:29; 5:23-24; 18:21-22, 35.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;Our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>All the sufferings God has assigned to us have one unique purpose&mdash;to renew us; today we are in the process of being renewed to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2.</li>
			<li>The weight of glory will become the beauty of the adorned bride&mdash;v. 11.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:17; 4:16; Gal. 6:15</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>As believers in Christ, we have been made a new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The most crucial matter in God&rsquo;s full, all-inclusive salvation is His making us a new creation in Christ&mdash;Gal. 6:15.</li>
	<li>The term <em>new creation</em> is an expression conveying the plain and real fact that we have been saved to be made a new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 6:2; 5:17.</li>
	<li>Like the old creation, the new creation is corporate; in the new creation we all are parts of the new man, the church, composed of the many sons of God&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 1:5; Heb. 2:10-12.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is not just to redeem, to repossess, the fallen old creation but to regenerate man to make him the new creation&mdash;John 3:3; 1:12-13; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
	<li>We are a new creation through our organic union with Christ&mdash;v. 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and nature; this is of God through our faith in Christ&mdash; 1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:26-28.</li>
		<li>Apart from this organic union, we remain in the old creation, but by the organic union with the Triune God in Christ, we are in the new creation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The new creation is a person regenerated with the life of God and living in the inner man, not in the outer man&mdash; John 3:3, 5-6, 15; 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There is a basic difference between the old creation and the new creation&mdash;Gen. 1:1; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Rev. 21:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation has God within it as its life, nature, appearance, and expression.</li>
	<li>The old creation as an empty vessel has no content of God, but the new creation as a corporate vessel has God as its content&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 3:19b.</li>
	<li>The old creation was old because God was not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it&mdash;4:22-24.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s goal is to produce the new creation out of the old creation; the new creation is the old creation transformed by the divine life&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>The new creation&mdash;the mingling of God with man&mdash; takes place when the Triune God in Christ as the Spirit is wrought into our being; this is the mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 3:16-17a.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is new because, as God&rsquo;s new creation, it has God&rsquo;s nature of newness&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 5a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Since newness is God, to become new is to become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead by having God wrought into us&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 7:6; Eph. 4:23-24.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of the realm of newness, which is Christ&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ dealt with the problem of the old creation through His crucifixion, His all-inclusive death on the cross&mdash;Luke 23:44-46; Heb. 10:20; Exo. 26:31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The main item terminated by the death of Christ was the old creation.</li>
	<li>Because Christ died on the cross as the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15), His death terminated the old creation.</li>
	<li>In the sight of God, the entire old creation was crucified with Christ and buried with Him&mdash;cf. John 20:5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The new creation comes into being by resurrection&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:17; 1 Cor. 15:20, 23, 45:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His work in His resurrection, Christ rose up on the first day of the week to germinate the new creation&mdash; John 20:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fact that Christ rose on the first day indicates that the universe had a new beginning in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
		<li>Whereas the Lord&rsquo;s death was the termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation.</li>
		<li>When the old creation is germinated with the divine life, it becomes the new creation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit to germinate some of those in the old creation to be the new creation&mdash;John 20:17.</li>
		<li>First Corinthians 15:45 implies the old creation with the soul as the center and the new creation with the Spirit as the center.</li>
		<li>The life-giving Spirit is the center and lifeline of the new creation&mdash;v. 45b; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are made a new creation by being regenerated&mdash; 1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Regeneration causes us to become a new creation, something which has the element of God within it&mdash;1:12-13; Ezek. 36:26.</li>
	<li>Regeneration causes us to have God&rsquo;s life and element, thereby making us a new creation&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In our experience we are in the process of becoming a new creation by being broken and renewed&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; 4:10-12, 16; Eph. 4:23-24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although our spirit has been regenerated, our soul with its faculties of mind, will, and emotion remains in the old creation and needs to be renewed.</li>
	<li>To be renewed is to have God&rsquo;s ever-new essence dispensed into us to replace and discharge our old element&mdash; 2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 12:2; Titus 3:5.</li>
	<li>Through the process of renewing, we are transferred from the realm of the old creation into the realm of the new creation to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Col. 3:10; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to overcome the old creation by living in the ascension of Christ in resurrection&mdash;S. S. 2:8-13; 4:6-9; 6:10a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The physical things are part of the old creation; if we desire the physical things of the world, we are living in the old creation.</li>
	<li>A Christian who lives in the old creation cares for physical things.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:16&mdash;6:2, 11-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The ministers of the new covenant are ambassadors of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 5:20a; Eph. 6:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>An ambassador of Christ is one who represents God, the highest authority in the universe:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God has given all authority in heaven and on earth to Christ&mdash;Matt. 28:18.</li>
		<li>Jesus is the Christ&mdash;the Lord of all, the King of kings and the Lord of lords&mdash;the highest authority&mdash; Acts 2:36; 10:36; 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 17:14; 19:16.</li>
		<li>The Lord needs some ambassadors on earth who are qualified to represent Him&mdash;Matt. 28:19.</li>
		<li>A new covenant minister is one who has been authorized with the heavenly authority to represent the highest authority&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6; 5:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The apostles were commissioned to represent Christ to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Matt. 10:40; John 13:20; Gal. 4:14b.</li>
			<li>All the members of the Body are representatives of the Head, His ambassadors&mdash;Acts 9:6, 10-17; 22:12-16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As an ambassador of Christ, Paul was &ldquo;the acting God&rdquo;&mdash; 2 Cor. 1:3-4, 12, 15-16; 2:10; 10:1; 11:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul was one with Christ to be the acting God in comforting the believers&mdash;1:3-4.</li>
		<li>Paul conducted himself in the singleness of God, for he was an imitator of the simple God and lived God&mdash;v. 12.</li>
		<li>Paul&rsquo;s coming to the Corinthians was the coming of God as grace&mdash;vv. 15-16.</li>
		<li>Paul forgave a particular matter in the person of Christ&mdash;2:10.</li>
		<li>Paul entreated the believers through the meekness and gentleness of Christ&mdash;10:1.</li>
		<li>Paul was jealous over the saints with the jealousy of God&mdash;11:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As ambassadors of Christ, the new covenant ministers carry out the ministry of reconciliation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:18-20; 6:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The apostles were authorized by Christ to represent Him to do the work of reconciliation&mdash;5:18, 20.</li>
	<li>The ministry of reconciliation is not only to bring sinners back to God but also to bring believers absolutely into God and to make them absolutely one with Him.</li>
	<li>Two steps are required for men to be fully reconciled to God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin&mdash;v. 19:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>For this purpose Christ died for our sins that we might be forgiven&mdash;1 Cor. 15:3.</li>
			<li>Christ bore our sins on the cross that they might be judged by God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:24.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The second step is to reconcile believers living in the natural life to God from the flesh&mdash;2 Cor. 5:20:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>For this purpose Christ died for us, the persons, that we might live to Him in the resurrection life&mdash;vv. 14-15.</li>
			<li>Christ was made sin on our behalf that sin might be judged and done away with&mdash;v. 21; Rom. 8:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The two steps of reconciliation are portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle&mdash;Exo. 26:37, 31-35; Heb. 9:3; Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we are to carry out the ministry of reconciliation, we need to be identified with the crucified Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14; Gal. 2:20a; 5:24; 2 Cor. 4:10-12.</li>
	<li>The Corinthians still lived in the flesh, that is, in the soul, the outer man, the natural being&mdash;1 Cor. 3:1; 2:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The veil of the flesh, the natural man, separated them from God.</li>
		<li>Paul was working to cut asunder the separating veil of the flesh so that the believers at Corinth could enter into the Holy of Holies&mdash;Heb. 10:19-20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Only when we have been fully reconciled to God are we fully saved&mdash;2 Cor. 6:1-2; Rom. 5:10; Heb. 7:25.</li>
	<li>The extent to which we can bring others to God and into God is always measured by where we are with respect to God; the more we are in Him, the more we can reconcile others into Him&mdash;2 Cor. 12:12a; 5:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ministry of reconciliation brings us back to God to such an extent that we become the righteousness of God in Christ&mdash;v. 21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Not only are we justified by God (Gal. 2:16)&mdash;we actually become the righteousness of God.</li>
	<li>When Christ died on the cross as our Substitute, God considered Him not only the sin bearer but sin itself; now in resurrection Christ comes into us as life, and this life lives within us to constitute us into the righteousness of God.</li>
	<li>In substitution Christ was made sin for us; now in His constitution we become the righteousness of God in Him&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The phrase <em>in Him</em> means in union with Christ, not only positionally but also organically in resurrection.</li>
		<li>When Christ died on the cross, God condemned Him in the flesh as sin for us (Rom. 8:3; John 3:14) so that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God&rsquo;s righteousness; therefore, in the organic union with Christ we are made the righteousness of God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To become the righteousness of God in Christ is a matter of being right with God in our being; this is to have an inner being that is transparent and crystal clear&mdash;an inner being in the mind and will of God&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To be fully reconciled to God will cause us to be enlarged in our hearts; how large our heart is depends on the degree of our reconciliation to God&mdash;v. 20; 6:11-13.</li>
<li>Through the ministry of reconciliation, we are incorporated into the processed and consummated Triune God to become, in Christ, an enlarged, universal, divine-human incorporation; as a result, we become God&rsquo;s sanctuary, His dwelling place, His Holy of Holies&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 14:20, 23; Rev. 21:2, 10, 16.</li>

<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Every believer who loves the Lord and who wants to come up to God&rsquo;s standard should become a minister of the new covenant&mdash;Eph. 4:11-12; 1 Tim. 1:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The goal of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover the ministering of Christ by all the believers so that the church as the Body of Christ may be built up.</li>
	<li>In order to be new covenant ministers, we need a life of ministering Christ to others for the sake of His Body&mdash; Matt. 24:45-46.</li>
	<li>This excellent, marvelous ministry needs excellent ministers with an excellent life, whose living and being match their doing.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to work together with God by a life (not by any gift) that is all-sufficient and all-mature, able to fit all situations, able to endure any kind of treatment, to accept any kind of environment, to work in any kind of condition, and to take any kind of opportunity, for the carrying out of our ministry&mdash;John 14:6a; Acts 27:22-25; 28:3-6, 8-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To work together with God means that we are in God; only a person who is in God can bring others into God; our closeness to God is the measure of the result of our work&mdash;2 Cor. 5:20; 2:10.</li>
	<li>If we have been fully saved and have an all-fitting life, then any situation or circumstance is right for us to minister life to others&mdash;Phil. 1:20; 4:22; 2 Tim. 4:2a; cf. 2 Chron. 1:10.</li>
	<li>There are eighteen qualifications of the ministers of the new covenant and of the pattern of an all-fitting life&mdash; 2 Cor. 6:4-7a:

		<li>In stripes&mdash;11:23-24; Gal. 6:17.</li>
		<li>In imprisonments&mdash;2 Cor. 11:23; Eph. 3:1; 4:1; 6:20.</li>
		<li>In tumults&mdash;Acts 17:5; 19:23.</li>
		<li>In labors&mdash;2 Cor. 11:23, 27; 1 Thes. 2:9; 2 Thes. 3:8.</li>
		<li>In watchings&mdash;2 Cor. 11:27; Acts 16:25; 20:7-11, 31.</li>
		<li>In fastings&mdash;2 Cor. 11:27.</li>
		<li>In pureness&mdash;1 Tim. 5:1-2.</li>
		<li>In knowledge&mdash;Col. 1:9.</li>
		<li>In long-suffering&mdash;1 Thes. 5:14.</li>
		<li>In kindness&mdash;Gal. 5:22; Rom. 2:4.</li>
		<li>In a holy spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 7:1.</li>
		<li>In unfeigned love&mdash;Luke 10:27; 1 Pet. 1:22.</li>
		<li>In the word of truth&mdash;Eph. 4:15.</li>
		<li>In the power of God&mdash;Isa. 40:31; 2 Cor. 12:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The new covenant ministers with the pattern of an all-fitting life carry out their ministry through three groups of items&mdash;6:7b-8a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left&mdash;Matt. 6:33; 5:6, 10, 20.</li>
		<li>Through glory and dishonor&mdash;1 Cor. 4:10-13.</li>
		<li>Through evil report and good report&mdash;Matt. 5:11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The new covenant ministers with the pattern of an all-fitting life are seven kinds of persons&mdash;2 Cor. 6:8b-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As deceivers and yet true&mdash;Matt. 10:16.</li>
		<li>As unknown and yet well known&mdash;John 6:15; 2 Cor. 4:5.</li>
		<li>As dying and yet behold we live&mdash;1 Cor. 15:31; 2 Cor. 4:10-11.</li>
		<li>As being disciplined and yet not being put to death&mdash;Rom. 8:28-29.</li>
		<li>As made sorrowful yet always rejoicing&mdash;Matt. 5:4; 2 Cor. 11:28; Phil. 4:4.</li>
		<li>As poor yet enriching many&mdash;Eph. 3:8.</li>
		<li>As having nothing and yet possessing all things&mdash; 1 Cor. 3:21-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>If we would have an all-fitting life, we need an enlarged heart, a heart to embrace all of God&rsquo;s people&mdash;2 Cor. 6:11-13; cf. 2 Chron. 1:10; 1 Kings 4:29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be enlarged by growing and maturing in life is equivalent to being fully reconciled to God.</li>
		<li>With an enlarged heart we are able to embrace all believers regardless of their condition, and with an opened mouth we are free to speak to all believers frankly concerning the real situation into which they have been misled&mdash;Matt. 5:7; 6:14-15; 7:1-2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to be enlarged to have the intimate concern of the ministering life&mdash;2 Cor. 7:2-3; 1 Thes. 2:8; Phil. 2:19-20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we have the ability to carry on a work but lack an intimate concern, our work will be fruitless; our not having the loving and forgiving heart of our Father God and the shepherding and seeking spirit of our Savior Christ is the reason for our barrenness&mdash;cf. Luke 15.</li>
	<li>Eloquence, gift, and power can never touch people as much as our concern for them&mdash;1 Cor. 12:31; 2 Tim. 1:7; Philem. 9-12.</li>
	<li>How fruitful we are does not depend upon what we are able to do, but on whether or not we have an intimate concern&mdash;1 Cor. 12:31b; 9:22; Matt. 9:12-13.</li>
	<li>A ministering life is a life that warms up others by cherishing them in the humanity of Jesus to nourish them in the divinity of Christ with the riches of Christ&mdash;Eph. 5:29; Prov. 25:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul shepherded the saints as a nursing mother and an exhorting father&mdash;1 Thes. 2:7-8, 11-12; Acts 20:19-20, 27, 31.</li>
		<li>Paul came down to the weak ones&rsquo; level so that he could gain them&mdash;2 Cor. 11:28-29; 1 Cor. 9:22; cf. Matt. 12:20.</li>
		<li>As a lover of the church in oneness with the church-loving Christ, Paul was willing to spend what he had, referring to his possessions, and to spend what he was, referring to his being, for the sake of the saints in order to build up the Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 5:25; 2 Cor. 12:15; 11:28-29.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:1, 24; 10:8; 12:12, 15; 13:4, 10</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Apostolic authority, in contrast to people&rsquo;s consideration in their natural concept, is not for ruling over the believers but for building them up&mdash;2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10; 1:24; cf. 1 Pet. 5:3.</li>
<li>Our understanding of the word <em>apostle</em> must be biblical, that is, according to the pure Word of God, not according to religious tradition&mdash;2 Cor. 1:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Greek word for <em>apostle</em> means &ldquo;one who is sent&rdquo;:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>An apostle of the Lord is a believer who is sent out by Him with His authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish churches&mdash;Acts 13:1-4; 14:4, 14-15.</li>
		<li>Paul was a sent one, not self-appointed but called by the Lord; his apostleship was authentic, having the authority of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash; 1 Cor. 9:1-5; 2 Cor. 12:11-12; cf. 11:13; Rev. 2:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When Paul refers to himself as an apostle (2 Cor. 1:1; 12:12), he means one sent by God to minister Christ into sinners so that they may become sons of God and members of Christ and then be edified to grow and become the Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 1:1; 8:14; 12:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul did not use this word with the connotation that an apostle is a powerful person authorized by Christ to control and overrule (2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10); such a concept is despicable.</li>
		<li>None of us should be an apostle in the sense of taking the position to exercise authority over others; rather, we should all be slaves of Christ&mdash;Matt. 20:25-28; Rom. 1:1; 2 Pet. 1:1; James 1:1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The real apostles experience adversity and suffering because the entire earth is opposed to God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;2 Cor. 11:16-33; 6:4-10; 1 Cor. 4:9-13; Col. 1:24.</li>
<li>The leading sign of an apostle is endurance&mdash;2 Cor. 12:12; 6:4; Rev. 1:9.</li>
<li>The apostles followed the pattern of Christ, willing to be weak in the organic union with Him, that they might live with Him a crucified life for the building up of the church&mdash;2 Cor. 13:4.</li>
<li>As an apostle, Paul was desperately absolute for the Lord&rsquo;s interests; he was willing not only to sacrifice all his rights but also to pay the price of his life&mdash; 12:15; 11:28; 1 Cor. 9:12, 15, 18; Acts 20:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should be willing to pour out our whole being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;for the Body of Christ.</li>
	<li>Whenever we touch the work of the Lord for His Body, we must have a pure motive and a proper attitude:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Instead of seeking what others have, we should seek only them and desire to gain them for the Lord&rsquo;s Body and to utterly spend what we are and have for the Body&mdash;2 Cor. 12:15.</li>
		<li>Then what we do and are will be a benefit to the Body.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Paul exercised the authority inherent in his apostleship by engaging in spiritual warfare, by moving within the measure of God&rsquo;s rule, and by his jealousy for Christ over the believers&mdash;10:3-4, 13; 11:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Though we walk in flesh, we do not war according to flesh; for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds&rdquo;&mdash;10:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the spiritual warfare, Paul fought according to the spirit with weapons that were divinely powerful.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;As we overthrow reasonings and every high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take captive every thought unto the obedience of Christ&rdquo;&mdash; v. 5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Reasonings and thoughts are the strongholds of Satan within the minds of those who are disobedient to God.</li>
			<li>Through the spiritual warfare, the reasonings and high things must be overthrown and every thought must be taken captive unto the obedience of Christ.</li>
			<li>The high things&mdash;the haughty things within the reprobate mentality that are against the knowledge of God&mdash;must be overthrown by the spiritual weapons.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;We will not boast beyond our measure but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us&rdquo;&mdash;v. 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The apostles went out to preach the gospel and to teach the truth within God&rsquo;s measure and according to His rule.</li>
		<li>A basic requirement for the growth and development of the Body is that we recognize our measure and not go beyond it&mdash;Eph. 4:7, 16.</li>
		<li>Like Paul, we should move and act according to how much God has measured to us, staying within the limits of God&rsquo;s ruling, God&rsquo;s measuring.</li>
		<li>As soon as we go beyond our measure, we go beyond the authority of the Head, move out from under the anointing, and interfere with the order of the Body&mdash; Rom. 12:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 11:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul engaged the believers to be the bride of the Bridegroom, the wife of the Lamb&mdash;John 3:29; Rev. 19:7.</li>
		<li>The genuine ministry stirs up our love for the Lord Jesus as our Bridegroom.</li>
		<li>We should care only for Christ, love Him, and allow no one to replace Him in our hearts&mdash;Mark 12:30; 1 Cor. 2:9; Eph. 6:24.</li>
		<li>If we take Christ as our Husband&mdash;a most intimate matter&mdash;we will realize that we need a wife&rsquo;s fidelity, and we will learn to enjoy Christ as our life and to live, walk, and behave in oneness with Him&mdash;Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>

		<li>The current of the Divine Trinity within us as revealed in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is our spiritual pulse.</li>

	<li>The blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is the same as that in Numbers 6:22-27; this is the eternal blessing of the Triune God, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His Divine Trinity into us for our enjoyment:
