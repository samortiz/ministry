        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING THE REALITY</h1>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew, the first Gospel, the Lord Jesus was completely outside religion; in other words, He had nothing to do with religion. Now we will take a look at the last Gospel, the Gospel of John.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INCARNATE WORD COMING WITH REALITY</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; When was the beginning? What is the meaning of <em>the beginning</em>? The beginning in this verse is the beginning before time existed. It refers to eternity past before the beginning in Genesis 1:1. In eternity past, before the beginning of time, the Lord Jesus was the Word. <em>Word</em> in the original Greek does not refer to an instant word or a brief word. It refers to a constant word.</p>
<p>As the Word of God, Christ speaks concerning God in a constant manner. As the Word, Christ speaks concerning God. Christ is the constant definition, expression, and declaration of God. Verse 18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; As the Word of God, Christ explains God. This means that the Word is God Himself.</p>
<p>God is mysterious. We believe that God exists, but none of us has seen God. Some people are experts in electricity, but no one has seen electricity. We can see light, the expression of electricity, but not electricity itself. A person may say that electricity is inside a light bulb, but if he breaks the light bulb, he will not see electricity. Likewise, God is mysterious. God is omnipresent, and His existence is real, but no one has ever seen Him. We praise the Lord that when the Lord Jesus came, the invisible God was declared through the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>One day Philip said, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us&rdquo; (14:8). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord&rsquo;s answer shows that He is the expression, manifestation, and explanation of the Father. Our Lord Jesus is God.</p>
<p>Verse 1 of chapter 1 says that in the beginning, before time, the Lord was the Word. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; How mysterious this is! One day the Word became flesh. This means that the Word became a man named Jesus, and He tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality. What is reality? The Gospel of John says that the Lord Jesus is our real light (8:12; 9:5) and air (20:22). He is also the bread of life (6:35, 41, 48), the water of life (4:14; 7:38), and the eternal abode (14:2, 23). He is our light, air, bread, water, and abode. The light from the sun is not the real thing; it is but a shadow. The Lord Jesus is the real light. If we do not have Him, whether we are under the powerful shining of an electric light or under the shining of the sun at noontime, we are still in darkness. The Lord Jesus is the real light. Only when we have the Lord Jesus do we have real light.</p>
<p>Likewise, no matter how much fresh air we breathe, that air is but a shadow; it is not the reality of air. The Lord Jesus is the real air. No matter how much water we drink, without the Lord Jesus, we will still be thirsty. No matter how much food we eat, without the Lord Jesus, we will still be hungry. We may live in a luxurious penthouse or a palace, but without the Lord Jesus, we are homeless and wandering. Only when we have the Lord Jesus do we have a home, a place of rest. All things are but shadows; only the Lord Jesus is reality. We may think that the clothes we wear are real, but if we do not have the Lord Jesus, we will realize that we are naked when we meet Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE REALITY OF THE LAW</h2>
<p>There are three main categories of the Old Testament law. The first category is related to the tabernacle with its furnishings, such as the Ark, the golden lampstand, the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden incense altar, and the various offerings. These items are all types of the Lord Jesus. The second category is related to ceremonies, including circumcision, the Sabbath, and the feasts. An Israelite had to be circumcised, keep the Sabbath, and keep the three annual feasts of the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. These ceremonies are also types of Christ. The third category consists of commandments and ordinances, such as honoring one&rsquo;s parents, not stealing, loving one&rsquo;s neighbor as oneself, and dietary regulations.</p>
<p>The tabernacle with its furniture, the offerings, the ceremonies, the commandments, and the ordinances are all shadows. The Lord Jesus is the body, that is, the solid substance, the reality, of the shadows (Col. 2:16-17). The Lord Jesus is the real tabernacle, the real table of the bread of the Presence, the real lampstand, and the real golden incense altar. The Lord Jesus is also the real burnt offering, the real meal offering, the real peace offering, the real sin offering, the real trespass offering, the real wave offering, and the real heave offering. He is all the offerings. Not only so, He is also the real Sabbath, our real rest, and He is our real circumcision. He is also our real feast. When we have Him, we have a feast daily and are truly joyful. In order to truly honor our parents, our honoring must be Christ. Apart from Christ, our honoring is merely a shell, without any reality. Christ is the reality of honoring our parents. In order for our children to honor us, they must have Christ. Without Christ, their honoring is unreliable and temporary. They may honor us in the morning but argue with us in the evening.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives&rdquo; (Eph. 5:25). Do the brothers who are husbands really love their wives? We must admit that our love for our wives is problematic because it is unreliable. In the beginning we loved our wives very much, but now we do not love them that much. The Bible also says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 22). I know a certain sister who complained to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;You are unfair. If You had given me a husband who is as good as Mrs. Chang&rsquo;s husband, I would be subject to him. You gave me a bad husband, and You want me to be subject to him. This is unreasonable.&rdquo; It is not easy for a wife to be subject to her husband. A wife&rsquo;s subjection to her husband is Christ, and a husband&rsquo;s love for his wife is also Christ. Christ is our reality. Without Christ, there is no reality.</p>
<p>According to Colossians 2:16-17, eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and the Sabbath are all shadows, but the body is of Christ. Christ is the body of every positive thing. Even our humility is a shadow. Christ is the reality of our humility. Some sisters are very gentle, but is this gentleness real? Some brothers are well mannered, but is this real? Without Christ, our gentleness is not real, our humility is not real, our patience is not real, and our manners are not real. Christ is our real gentleness, our real patience, our real humility, and our real manners. Without Christ, everything is vanity. Christ is the reality of every positive thing.</p>
<p>The Bible says that husbands should love their wives. If a brother determines to love his wife because of this word, he will become a religious person and grit his teeth in order to love his wife. This also applies to the sisters. A sister who forces herself to be subject to her husband because of what the Bible says is a religious person. When she is not in subjection, she is rebellious, but when she is in her self-imposed subjection, she is religious.</p>
<p>Some sisters may say that this is very difficult and ask whether they should be in subjection. Do not refuse to be in subjection, and do not try to be in subjection. We should neither be rebellious persons nor religious persons. What should we be? We should be Christians. We do not care for being in subjection, nor do we care for not being in subjection. We care for only one thing&mdash;living by Christ. We should not read Ephesians 5 as a law or a commandment; rather, we should take it as our enjoyment. We should pray-read the words in Ephesians 5 and receive them into our spirit to be our supply. Then instead of a sister gritting her teeth to be in subjection or making up her mind to submit, she will inexplicably be subject to her husband. Being in subjection to her husband will be so spontaneous that she will not realize or sense that she is in subjection. This is what it means to be a Christian.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;Always rejoice&rdquo; (1 Thes. 5:16). In the past I tried to practice being joyful. However, I discovered that when I did not practice to be joyful, I did not have many problems. However, once I tried to be joyful, problems would arise, and many unhappy things would happen. Instead of good news, I would receive only bad news. Finally, when I decided to give up on the matter of being joyful, I experienced the real joy that is in the Lord. The Lord is my joy when I am in Him. When we are in the Lord, no matter how many problems we have, we are joyful, and our difficulties deepen our taste of the Lord. Our taste of the Lord is deepened in our difficulties, and our taste of the Lord is sweeter in our hardships. Real joy comes from Christ.</p>
<p>What is reality? Reality is Christ. Christ should be everything to us in our living. He is the honoring that we have toward our parents. He is the love that brothers have toward their wives. He is the subjection that sisters have toward their husbands. He is joy, peace, patience, humility, and gentleness. He is our all.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
