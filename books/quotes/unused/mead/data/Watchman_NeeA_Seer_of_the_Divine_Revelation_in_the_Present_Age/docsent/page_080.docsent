   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Reality of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Along with the practical aspect of the church, Watchman Nee saw the reality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He stressed that the content of the church must be Christ living in and being lived out through all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything that is not Christ is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Practically speaking, the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ, therefore, is the reality of the church, and the church should be the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>41.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Oneness of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The genuine oneness of the church is the oneness of the Spirit Eph 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Real oneness is not the oneness of doctrines, opinions, or certain practices; real oneness is the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even though we may be one in doctrine and in the way we do things, if we are not in the Spirit, we do not have genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>42.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Seeing the Body</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the years 1939 to 1942, Watchman Nee was consistently burdened concerning the revelation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was burdened to help Christians see the Body, not in a doctrinal way but in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He continually stressed that seeing the Body makes it impossible to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once one sees the Body, he behaves and acts in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>43.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Authority of the Holy Spirit in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Watchman Nee saw that since the Body of Christ is an organism, the Holy Spirit must have authority over everything in every part.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the activity of the Body must be under the authority and direction of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>44.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Reality of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit is the reality of all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The term spiritual things is vain and empty unless the Holy Spirit Himself is the content and reality of every spiritual thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit is the reality of the Christians' life and also the reality of their living.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever they are and do must have the Holy Spirit as the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>45.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Authority of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the practice of the practical church life, Watchman Nee saw the necessity of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The authority that Christ as the Head imparts to certain members of His Body is called deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The local churches must be under this kind of deputy authority in a marvelous order.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This authority is crucial for the building up of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By this means the church becomes a vertical vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this, submission is necessary.</S>
