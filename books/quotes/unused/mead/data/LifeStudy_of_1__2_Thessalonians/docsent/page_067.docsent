   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANING OF WATCHFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the crucial matter of understanding what it means to be watchful and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchfulness here is related to a battle, a fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some versions use the word vigilant, a word related to warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Soldiers in a battle need to be watchful, vigilant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fact that watchfulness is related to fighting is confirmed by Paul's mention of the breastplate and helmet in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A breastplate and helmet are not ordinary items of dress.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are, of course, part of the armor used by soldiers in fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul's concept of being watchful and sober, therefore, is related to fighting, to warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In these verses Paul is talking about some kind of battle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are sugar-coated teachings about the Lord's coming and the rapture revealed in chapter four, but these teachings do not prepare believers for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, they cause them to be drugged and in a stupor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is important for us to see that watchfulness refers to a proper spirit in fighting a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we grasp this thought, we shall have in large measure the proper understanding of what it means to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be watchful is to continue fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Soldiers in a battle do not merely look around.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is not to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are watchful because they are fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When they stop fighting, they are no longer watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to our understanding, to be watchful is simply to look out for something, for example, to watch our step as we are walking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But this is not the meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In these verses to be watchful is to remember that we are in a battle, that we are fighting and are surrounded by enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the reason we need a helmet and also a breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again and again we have emphasized the fact that 1 Thessalonians is an epistle written to new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This book contains many basic concepts regarding the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In each of the five chapters certain basic principles, certain elementary teachings, are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But even in a book concerned with elementary teachings, Paul includes the matter of spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul does not explicitly tell the believers that they are on a battlefield and need to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But what he says in 5:1-11 implies spiritual fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>SALVATION FROM THE COMING DESTRUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 3 the word destruction is used: "Whenever they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as birth pangs to a woman with child, and they shall by no means escape."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is this destruction?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is related to the salvation mentioned in verses 8 and 9.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Salvation in these verses is salvation from the coming destruction through the Lord's coming back, not salvation from eternal perdition through the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fallen man will perish for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We who have believed in the Lord Jesus will be saved from eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have already obtained salvation in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have been saved from eternal perdition, and we shall never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Biblical salvation from eternal perdition is eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we are saved, we are saved for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Contrary to the teaching of the Arminian school of theology, we cannot lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Salvation is once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But here Paul is speaking about salvation in another respect, that is, salvation from the coming destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, in the light of Romans 8:21-25, we shall also be saved from the slavery of corruption of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All created things are today subject to the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The entire old creation is enslaved to corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everything, including our physical body, is decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you know what it means to get old?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To get old is to decay.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We all are in the process of decaying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The slavery of corruption in the old creation is controlling us, and we are subject to it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when the Lord Jesus comes and we are raptured, we shall be saved from the slavery of corruption of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, the Lord's coming and our rapture will save us from two things: destruction and the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the salvation mentioned in verses 8 and 9.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, the primary meaning is the salvation from the coming destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we must go on to find out what this coming destruction is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This destruction is related to the battle that is raging between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Near to the time of the Lord's coming, destruction will take place suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That destruction will come primarily from God, but a portion of it will be caused by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God will judge this rebellious world, and Satan will fight back.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The result of the intense battle raging between God and Satan will be sudden destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It will be when people say, "Peace and security," that this destruction will come suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to be saved from this sudden destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The way to be saved from it is to be watchful and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As God is fighting, we must take sides with Him and fight for His interests.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since He is fighting, we should be fighting also.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Actually, to fight is to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only those who are fighting are truly watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we are fighting, the more watchful we shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As long as you are fighting, you need not try to be watchful, for you will be watchful automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Sometimes soldiers in an army go for days without sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The battle does not allow them time to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This illustrates the fact that to fight is to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Christian life, a holy life for the church life, is a life of fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are on the battlefield, and we need to be alert, watchful, vigilant.</S>
