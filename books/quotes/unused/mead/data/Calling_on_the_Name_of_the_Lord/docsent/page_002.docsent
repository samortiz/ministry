   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICED BY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Calling on the name of the Lord was practiced by the New Testament believers beginning on the day of Pentecost Acts 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While Stephen was being stoned to death, he was calling on the name of the Lord Acts 7:59 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Testament believers practiced calling on the Lord Acts 9:14; 22:16; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Tim 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Saul of Tarsus received authority from the chief priests to bind all that called on the name of the Lord Acts 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that all the early saints were Jesus-callers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Their calling on the name of the Lord was a sign, a mark, that they were Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we become those who call on the name of the Lord, our calling will mark us out as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul the apostle stressed the matter of calling when he wrote the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him; for whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved" Rom 10:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul also spoke of calling on the Lord in 1 Corinthians when he wrote the words, "With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours" 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, in 2 Timothy he told Timothy to pursue spiritual things with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By all of these verses we can see that in the first century the Christians practiced calling on the name of the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, throughout the Old Testament as well as in the early days of the Christian age, the saints called on the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How regrettable that it has been neglected by most Christians for so long a time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We believe that today the Lord wants to recover calling on His name and to have us practice it so that we may enjoy the riches of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE PURPOSE OF CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why do we need to call on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Men need to call on the name of the Lord in order to be saved Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way of praying quietly does help people to be saved, but not so richly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way of calling loudly helps people to be saved in a richer and more thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, we need to encourage people to open themselves and to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Psalm 116 tells us that we may partake of the Lord's salvation by calling on Him: "I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord" v. 13 . In this one Psalm, calling on the Lord is mentioned four times vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2, 4, 13, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have seen earlier, the way to draw water from the springs of salvation is to call upon the name of the Lord Isa 12:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians have never called upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have never called, even shouted before the Lord, it is doubtful that you have enjoyed the Lord in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Call upon His name!...Cry out and give a ringing shout" Isa 12:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Try shouting before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have never shouted about what the Lord is to you, try it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more you shout, "O Lord Jesus, You are so good to me!" the more you will be released from your self and filled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thousands of saints have been released and enriched through calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another reason for calling on the Lord is to be rescued from distress Psa 18:6; 118:5 , from trouble Psa 50:15; 86:7; 81:7 , and from sorrow and pain Psa 116:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>People who have argued against calling on the Lord have found themselves calling on Him when they were subject to a certain trouble or illness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When our lives are free from trouble, we may argue against calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when trouble comes, no one will need to tell us to call on Him; we will call spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Also, the way for us to participate in the Lord's plenteous mercy is to call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we call upon Him, the more we enjoy His mercy Psa 86:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another reason for calling on the Lord is to receive the Spirit Acts 2:17a, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The best and easiest way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit has already been poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We simply need to receive Him by calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Isaiah 55:1 says, "Ho!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and you who have no money; come, buy and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the way to eat and drink the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Isaiah gives us the way in verse 6 of the same chapter: "Seek Jehovah while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, the way to eat the spiritual food for our satisfaction is to seek the Lord and to call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Romans 10:12 says that the Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The way to enjoy the riches of the Lord is to call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord is not only rich, but also near and available, because He is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the Spirit, He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may call on His name at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we call on Him, He comes to us as the Spirit, and we enjoy His riches.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In chapter twelve, Paul tells us how to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The way to enjoy the Lord is to call on His name 12:3; 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whenever we call "Lord Jesus," He comes as the Spirit, and we drink of Him 12:13 , the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I call a person's name, and if he is real, living, and present, that person will come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus is real, living, and present!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is always available.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever we call on Him, He comes.</S>
