   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S PRAYER IN THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His prayer in the garden of Gethsemane, it appears that He was afraid to take the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The cup represents the cross; it represents redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord knew that man needed redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He came to the earth and lived for over thirty years for the purpose of going to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet the Lord was not set on taking the cup; He was not set on going to the cross to accomplish redemption for man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was seeking God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was obedient to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord could choose to go to the cross or not to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He could choose to take the cup or refuse the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord's ultimate intention was to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not an easy thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God told Abraham to take Isaac to Mount Moriah and offer him up on the altar as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was hard for Abraham to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when Abraham took up his knife and was ready to kill, God told him to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was also difficult for Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had already lifted up his knife, and it was hard for him to drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If Christ had refused to give up His crucifixion, His obedience would not have been perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Right up to the point when He was about to die, the Lord was not set on taking the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would not have been a perfect obedience if the Lord had been inflexible about His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this respect the prayer in the garden of Gethsemane was a most profound exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Right up to the point of His death, He was still unsettled as to His taking of the cross; He was still inquiring of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To Him the cross was dispensable; He was not decided on this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He could take the cup, or He could reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet He would not insist on His own will, but only God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the Lord's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Throughout the ages many theologians have seriously offended the Lord by foolishly misjudging Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They thought that the Lord was afraid to die, that He was weak in His flesh and fearful of the bitter cup.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, the Lord was not afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was trying to be certain of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He could drink the cup, or He could refuse the cup, but God's will must be done.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord did not pray that God would allow Him to act independently; He prayed that He would act according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To Him, God's will was absolute, while the cup was relative.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our Lord never acted against God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once He was clear that the cross was God's will, He told the disciples, "Arise, let us be going" Matt 26:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As they were leaving the garden, the persecutors came.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peter drew his sword and struck the ear of the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord told Peter, "Put the sword into its sheath.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 18:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the Lord became clear that the cup was God's will, He no longer hesitated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord was not set on dying; He was set on obeying.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not enough to have a mind to die or to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord had a mind to obey!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THROUGH OBEDIENCE THE LORD RECEIVING</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Philippians 2 goes on to tell us that God highly exalted Christ and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, making Him Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord proceeded from His divinity for the purpose of establishing God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was obedient unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the end God raised Him from the dead and bestowed on Him the highest name the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to learn obedience every step of the way, just like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord was obedient to the end, and God highly exalted Him and committed all authority to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Revelation 4 and 5 describe the situation after the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All authority in heaven and on earth is no longer in God's hand; it has been given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one can open God's scroll except the Lord 5:2, 5 because God has committed all authority to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today He is God, and He is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He sits in heaven as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unless we are obedient all the way, we cannot express God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our submission to authority is the basis of becoming an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the straight pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ took this way before God made Him the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we desire to be an authority, we must have a thorough understanding of authority and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must not claim any authority for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must have a mind to obey; we must have the mind in us that was in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even after a man becomes an authority, he must still have a mind to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He has to maintain this ground and practice obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No matter what position we have as an authority, we should still have a mind to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The sooner we have a mind to obey, the sooner God will make us an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We worship the Lord that He was so clear about the nature of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Suppose the Father had said to the Lord at the end of His time on earth, "You have been on earth for thirty-three years, and You have finished the work that I have assigned to You.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now You can return to heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even if the Lord had considered the cross for thirty-three years, He would have immediately returned to the Father; He would not have waited for the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This was the Lord's mind; He did not insist on His own will.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God requires the same thing from us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He told Abraham to bring Isaac to the altar, and Abraham obeyed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Later He told Abraham to take Isaac back, telling him that his son would not die, and Abraham took Isaac back without any hesitation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's requirement on us is no less than His requirement on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to have this mind in us, which was in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only an obedient man can have the mind of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we have a mind that is set on obedience, God will be free to commit His authority to us just as He committed it to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The scroll in Revelation 5 contains the mystery of the future of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God did not open the scroll Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He committed it to the Lamb of God; Jesus of Nazareth was the One who opened it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God has left the execution of the plan of the universe to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Through the Lord's absolute obedience, God entrusted such authority to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>THE CHURCH NEEDING TO TAKE</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>THE WAY OF OBEDIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We know that this is the end time and that God is recovering the church.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He wants to entrust the church with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>During the past few days, we have seen that the church is the ultimate expression of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The church cannot fail.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The church has failed during the past two thousand years, but from now on it cannot fail.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It has to reach the glorious state described in Ephesians 4 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In the future men will recognize authority through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>How solemn is our responsibility today!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We can no longer say that one church's failure will be compensated by another church's revival.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We can fail no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Today the church must move at a rapid pace.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God is recovering His authority through us today.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Are we someone that God can trust?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>God's way hinges on us today.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We have to be absolute in our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have to obey to the end. Otherwise, God will not have a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Today rebellion still exists in the church, and unless we deal with this problem, there is no way for the church to be recovered.</S>
