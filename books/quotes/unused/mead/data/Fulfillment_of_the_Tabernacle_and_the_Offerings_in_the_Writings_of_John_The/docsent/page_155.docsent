   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Coming with the Son</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 16:32 the Lord indicates that the Father came with the Son: "Behold, an hour is coming and has come, when you shall be scattered each to his own, and shall leave Me alone; and I am not alone, because the Father is with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Father sent the Son, and the Father was with the Son; that is, the Father came with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may find this difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If someone sends you to a certain place, that person will usually remain where he is, and you will go to the designated place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the divine economy the Father sends the Son, and when the Son comes, the Father comes with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, the Father sent the Son; on the other hand, He came with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Bible students may have difficulty explaining how the Father could both send the Son and come with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The reason for this difficulty is that some try to separate the Father from the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the Father and the Son cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, when the Father sent the Son, He sent Himself in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Gospel of John reveals definitely that the Son was sent by the Father and that the Father came with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, according to John's Gospel, where the Son is, there the Father is also, and when the Son speaks, the Father also speaks in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 10:30 says clearly, "I and the Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son is in the Father, and the Father is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Son speaks, therefore, the Father speaks His word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to be impressed with the fact that it is beyond our ability to analyze how the Father and the Son are one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are not even able to analyze ourselves thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For instance, we know that the mind, the emotion, and the will are distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we cannot separate them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We cannot separate the mind from the emotion or the emotion from the will and then analyze these parts of our being separately.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that a human being is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we could separate these parts and analyze them, we would be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As soon as the three parts of a person are separated, the person dies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the spirit, soul, and body are distinct, they form a complete human being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, where the body is, there the soul and the spirit are also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may use this picture as an illustration of the relationship between the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Where the Father is, there the Son is, and where the Son is, there the Father is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, when the Son speaks, the Father speaks as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is this one speaking or two speakings?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps we should say it is two-one speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning the Father's sending the Son and coming with the Son, we should not analyze, but instead simply believe whatever the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Living and Working in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In John 14:10 and 11 the Lord Jesus says, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we see the Father living and working in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Giving All That He Has to the Son, Thus Embodied in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In John 16:15 the Lord says, "All that the Father has is Mine."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that the Father has given all that He has to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the Father is embodied in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regarding this, Paul says in Colossians 2:9, "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Father has given all that He has and is to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Father's being and doing are altogether in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the Son becomes the Father's embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Glorified in the Son</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to John 13:31, the Lord Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Son was glorified, the Father was glorified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later, we shall devote a full message to the matter of glorification.</S>
