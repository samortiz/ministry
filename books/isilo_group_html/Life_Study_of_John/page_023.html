Jesus Coming in Resurrection<br />to Weak and Fragile People<br />in the Enjoyment of Their Human Life</h2><p>Now we need to see that Jesus came in resurrection to weak and fragile people. Some may ask, &ldquo;How could Jesus come in resurrection when He had not been crucified yet? To say this is to allegorize.&rdquo; Yes, the whole story of changing water into wine is an allegory, and we need to allegorize every part of it.</p><h2 class="head3">1. &ldquo;The Third Day,&rdquo; Signifying in Resurrection</h2><p>The day upon which this sign was accomplished was &ldquo;the third day&rdquo; (2:1). &ldquo;The third day&rdquo; signifies the day of resurrection. In John 1 the words &ldquo;the next day&rdquo; are used three times, in verses 29, 35, and 43. Why does it say &ldquo;the next day&rdquo; three times in chapter one and then speak of &ldquo;the third day&rdquo; in 2:1? &ldquo;The third day&rdquo; in chapter two should not actually be called the third day, but the fifth. Perhaps you should go to John and argue with him, saying, &ldquo;Brother John, you did something wrong. You have three &lsquo;next days&rsquo; and so the day mentioned in 2:1 should be the fifth day.&rdquo; John would reply, &ldquo;Dear brother, that was why I did not speak of the second day, third day, and fourth day in chapter one, but called each of them &lsquo;the next day&rsquo; until I called the day in chapter two &lsquo;the third day.&rsquo;&rdquo; None of the events which transpired on the &ldquo;next days&rdquo; in chapter one were in resurrection.</p><p>Let us look at the three &ldquo;next days&rdquo; in chapter one. &ldquo;The next day John saw Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; (v. 29). Was that in resurrection? Certainly not. How can you say that was in resurrection? &ldquo;Again the next day John and two of his disciples were standing, and looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo; (vv. 35-36). Although this happened on the second &ldquo;next day,&rdquo; it did not occur on &ldquo;the third day.&rdquo; The third &ldquo;next day&rdquo; is found in verse 43. &ldquo;The next day He would go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip; and Jesus said to him, Follow Me.&rdquo; This did not happen on &ldquo;the third day,&rdquo; because &ldquo;the third day&rdquo; is the day of resurrection. None of the events mentioned in chapter one transpired on &ldquo;the third day,&rdquo; that is, in resurrection. Only as we come to the changing of water into wine in chapter two do we find mention of &ldquo;the third day.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head3">2. &ldquo;Cana,&rdquo; a Land of Reeds,<br />Signifying the Place of Weak and Fragile People</h2><p>How do we know that in John 2 Jesus came to weak and fragile people? We know it by the fact that He went to Cana and that Cana in Hebrew means &ldquo;a land of reeds.&rdquo; A reed in Scripture signifies fragile people. Both Isaiah and Matthew say that we, the weak people, are the &ldquo;bruised reed&rdquo; which the Lord will not break (Isa. 42:3; Matt. 12:20). In Matthew 11:7, the Lord, when referring to John the Baptist, asked the Jews if they went out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken by the wind. Of course, John the Baptist was not such a weak, fragile person that could be shaken by the wind. Therefore, Cana as a land of reeds symbolizes the earth. The whole world is a Cana, full of weak and fragile people to whom the Lord came. The Lord&rsquo;s coming to Cana signifies His coming into a world full of weak and fragile people. Although the people of this earth, like reeds, are weak and fragile, yet the Lord came to them in resurrection.</p><h2 class="head3">3. &ldquo;Galilee,&rdquo; a Despised Place</h2><p>The wedding which Jesus attended in John 2 was in Cana of Galilee. Galilee was a place despised by people (7:52). As a despised place, Galilee signifies the low and mean condition of the world.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of John &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
