The reason that God has many age-turning moves is that men used by Him in one age often become fallen and fail to reach His goal
Before a new age is ushered in, there are always men in the previous age who are used by God particularly to turn the age
Samuel turned the age of the priesthood to the age of the kingship, whereas Daniel turned the age of captivity to the age of return
In those days in Israel, on the one hand, there was the throne of the house of David and, on the other hand, the temple
One should remember that the glory of God filled the temple when Solomon consecrated it to God immediately after its completion
On the one hand, he brought in a throne and, on the other hand, he brought in a habitation through this throne
By the end of the books of Kings, which was the very end of the age of kingship, everything had become degraded and desolate
From the beginning of the Bible, we can see that what God cares for in man are the matters of image and authority
At the time when the age of the kings was about to begin, the Israelites did one thing that displeased God very much
Archaeologists and historians tell us that in those days there were all kinds of idols on the tower and in the city of Babel
What he always does is to establish a nation among men, instigating men to rebel against God and to deny His authority
At the same time, he sets up shrines everywhere in every nation for men to worship him so that they would express him
The other was the expression of God, because there was a return to the priestly and Levitical services of the temple
My only wish is that among the young brothers and sisters here, some would realize what is happening in the universe
We will realize that in the present age also, God needs someone to rise up and to turn the age as Samuel and Daniel did
Outwardly, they are celebrating the holy birth of Jesus Christ, but actually, they are in the flesh and indulging in their lusts
Not only do the Gentiles behave this way, but even many Christians also are carried away by the tide of this age
Many send Christmas cards to each other, greet each other with 'Merry Christmas,' set up trees at home, and hang little light bulbs on them
At least those meals were not clean according to the ordinances on cleanliness in Leviticus 11; it was defiled food
A little spiritual pursuit or a little godly living before the Lord is not enough to be used by the Lord to turn the age
All those who are used by the Lord to turn the age must be Nazarites; they must be voluntarily consecrated ones
The Bible records that in those days the king of Babylon chose a group of young men from different races to stand before him
At that time Daniel might have been only a young man in his teens yet the two matters of Gods authority and Gods glory were recovered in him
When Daniel's three friends flatly refused to worship the idols, that was in fact a proclamation that they expressed God!
They seemed to be declaring, 'Although it is true that we are in the land of Shinar, we are not the people of Shinar
Please remember that this was God being with them, in their midst, and expressed through them while in the furnace
Of course, we must realize that they expressed God this way because they submitted themselves to His authority
In almost all cases of turning the age, God does not show us that it is the Holy Spirit who calls and seeks for men
God shows us that every time the age is turned, God's work is seen in a very hidden way; it is not so apparent to man
You can also be used by God to turn the age today, but the secret lies in your willingness to consecrate yourselves
Young people, you must realize that God's testimony, including the authority and glory, has been destroyed in the tide of the world
Everyone who is used by God to turn the age must be one who consecrates himself voluntarily in the midst of this tide
The book of Daniel describes in a specific way the crucial position man occupies in the conflict between God and Satan
If man's position is right, Satan will lose his control over that age and will not be able to frustrate the turn
From Genesis to Revelation most of the cases of man's rebellion against God happened in Shinar, which is Babylon
By then everyone, including the Gentiles and the Israelites, was under Babel's ruling and was worshipping the Babylonian gods
At this time, although Daniel and his three friends were still very young, they stood up to be an anti-testimony
Not only the Gentiles are under the ruling of Babylon; even the so-called people of God, so-called Christianity, are also in captivity
The Israelites in those days were only Israelites outwardly; in reality they were not much different from the Babylonians
Please remember that if we do this, we will become completely useless in God's hand in the matter of turning the age
We should believe that he refused the food and drink of the king of Babylon because he had read the five books of Moses
At the same time, he must have found out that God's people cannot partake of any food that has touched the idols
Since he read these commandments and therefore knew God's desire, he accepted them and applied them to himself
Brothers and sisters, please remember that a person who turns the age for God must possess such a characteristic
When we come to Gods Word we have to learn not to study for some scholarship or for some knowledge but to find out Gods desire from His Word
You read clearly from the Bible that God's will forbids His children from being yoked together with unbelievers in everything
To be an anti-testimony, one must read God's Word, touch God's desire from His Word, and must join himself to this desire of God
If within you, you have touched God's desire, your living must be an anti-testimony against the age and the tide
From that point on, you should be determined not to befriend any unbelievers anymore because this is God's desire
Any time you find out God's desire from His Word, you must immediately join yourselves to this desire with fear and trembling
He declared before God and Satan that the health of his body did not at all depend on the Gentile food and drink
The strange thing is that the king was clear in the dream, yet he could not remember what went on in the dream after he woke up
The only reason he could see King Nebuchadnezzar's dream and could know its meaning was that he was a person living in prayer
If the paper was positioned correctly, the dream as a plate concerning God's desire would spontaneously be printed on it
If God could not find a man to pray for this on earth it would be hard to bring to pass the return of the Israelites after the seventy years
From the first day, God had answered his prayer by sending an angel to show him what would happen to the children of Israel
In other words when God in heaven was about to join Himself to man on earth He met Satans resistance and there was a twentyone day battle
Although God had already heard Daniel's prayer, Satan resisted in the air and would not allow God's answer to reach Daniel
Anyone who hides, withdraws, withers, and changes his mind when confronted with difficulties is not of much use in God's hands
They are not bold in a wild or natural way, but bold because of their fear of God and their courage to confront difficulties
When Nebuchadnezzar heard these words, he was full of fury, and the countenance of his face was changed toward them
When he saw that the Roman Catholic Church did things completely contrary to the truth, he rose up and became a strong anti-testimony
At the same time, undoubtedly, Luther was one who cared not for his own life and was willing to be martyred for the Lord
