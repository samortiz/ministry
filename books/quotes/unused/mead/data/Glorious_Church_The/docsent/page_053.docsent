   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE HOLY CITY, NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have already seen that the woman in Genesis 2 is the same woman seen in Ephesians 5 and in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us look at another woman, recorded in Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although there is a long distance between them, the last two chapters of Revelation correspond with the first three chapters of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God created the heaven and the earth in Genesis, and the new heaven and the new earth are in the last two chapters of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In both Genesis and Revelation there is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Genesis there is a river flowing out from Eden, and in Revelation there is a river of living water flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis there is gold, pearl bdellium , and a kind of precious stone onyx , and in Revelation there is gold, pearl, and all kinds of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis 2 Eve was Adam's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Revelation 21 the Lamb also has a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lamb's wife is the New Jerusalem, and God's eternal purpose is fulfilled in this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Genesis 3 man's fall was followed by death, sickness, suffering, and the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But, when the New Jerusalem descends from heaven in Revelation 21, there is no more death, sorrow, crying, or pain because the former things have all passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we read the Scriptures carefully, we will see that Genesis 1 through 3 does indeed correspond with Revelation 21 and 22.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They face each other at the two ends of the expanse of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we have seen four women: Eve in Genesis 2, the wife the church in Ephesians 5, the woman in the vision of Revelation 12, and the wife of the Lamb in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These four women are actually one woman, but her history can be divided into four stages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When she was conceived in the plan of God, she was called Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When she is redeemed and manifesting Christ on earth, she is called the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When she is persecuted by the great dragon, she is the woman in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When she is completely glorified in eternity, she is the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These four women reveal God's work from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The woman in Genesis 2 is the woman purposed in God's heart in eternity past, and the woman in Revelation 21 is the woman who fulfills God's purpose in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of the two women in between, one is the church, prepared for Christ by God, and the other is the woman who will bring forth the man-child at the end time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, these four women show us the four stages of the history of one woman: one stage is in eternity past, two stages are between the eternities, and another stage is in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though these four women appear to be different when we speak of them separately, they are the same when we put them together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The wife of the Lamb is the woman of Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the Lord Jesus is the Lamb, it is impossible for the woman in Ephesians 5 to be anyone other than the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The woman in Ephesians 5 is also likened to Eve, and Eve is also likened to the wife of the Lamb in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When there are overcomers, whose work represents that of the whole church, the woman in Revelation 12 will introduce the woman in Revelation 21.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, God in eternity future will indeed obtain a woman, a ruling woman who has dealt thoroughly with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will truly obtain a wife for the Lamb, and His purpose will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us see how the woman of Revelation 12 becomes the woman of Revelation 21.</S>
