   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR POWER THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Actually, our power is the Triune God as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do you not believe that the Triune God is with us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that He is with me in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I am about to minister, I usually pray, Lord, vindicate the fact that You are one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, I want to practice being one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, make it real that in my speaking You are one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, speak Your word in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the way I pray before giving a message.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, I believe that while I am speaking, He is one spirit with me and that He is speaking in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the real power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not trust in anything other than prayer, the Word, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps a certain professor will be able to give a message concerning science in order to convince students of science to believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although there is nothing wrong with this, we should not put our trust in it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the contrary, we should put our trust wholly and absolutely in prayer, in the Word, and in the anointing, which is the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>PAUL S DIRECT SPEAKING OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the book of Acts we see that the apostle Paul did not use gimmicks in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, he proclaimed Jesus, that this One is the Son of God 9:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Saul was in Damascus, he was empowered and confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that this One is the Christ 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a foregoing message we emphasized the fact that in Thessalonica Paul reasoned with those in the synagogue from the Scriptures concerning Christ and saying, This is the Christ, Jesus, whom I announce to you 17:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, we have seen that in Corinth Paul solemnly testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, instead of using gimmicks, Paul always spoke the word directly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>YOUNG SAINTS PREACHING WITH POWER</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps you would say, Brother Lee, you have been in the Word for over fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we be powerful in preaching the gospel if we are still young in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me testify to you that even when I was young my speaking was powerful because of these three matters of prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that even the young saints can preach the gospel with power and impact if they trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Young saints, you can take a portion of the Word and preach it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only do not trust in any eloquence you might have.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who are eloquent in speaking may not have any power or impact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But those who are not eloquent, and who may even mispronounce words, may have impact and power in their gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the Lord may even use speaking with the wrong pronunciation of words to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE EXAMPLE OF D. L. MOODY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As you may know, D. L. Moody was prevailing in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was a young apprentice in his uncle s shoe store when he became burdened to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day, after giving a gospel message, Moody was approached by a learned person who was in the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This person told Moody that he often used mistaken grammar in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moody s reply was something like this: Your grammar is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You go to preach and see what the result will be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I may use poor grammar, but through my preaching of the gospel people are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CONSTITUTED OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether or not we have power in preaching the gospel depends on our being, on our person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would have power, we need to be constituted of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because Paul was constituted of Christ in this way, in his messages he always preached Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 18:5 we see that Paul testified that Jesus is the Christ, and in verse 11, that during the year and a half he was in Corinth he taught the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to learn of Paul to testify of Christ and teach the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no shortcut to having power in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to pray, we need to learn the Word, and we need to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to stand upon this word, claim the fact, and practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should say, Lord, this is Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I stand on Your word, Lord, and claim the fact that I am one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Lord, I ask You to vindicate Your word that You are truly one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lord, I intend to speak for You and even to speak You forth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lord, vindicate the word and show that You are really one with Your followers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all need to pray such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is the prayer that will be heard in the heavens and by all the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are one spirit with the Lord in preaching the gospel, we shall have power and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, let us not trust in eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us trust in prayer, in the Word, and in the Spirit.</S>
