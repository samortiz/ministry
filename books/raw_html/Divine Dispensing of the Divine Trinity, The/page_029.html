 <h2 class="head1">CHRIST MINISTERED AND THE CHURCH PRODUCED</h2>
<p>When Christ is ministered and the church is produced, they two become the corporate Christ. The ministered Christ with the church produced out of Him becomes the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12). The church itself is the fullness of Christ, the expression of Christ (Eph. 1:23); whereas the corporate Christ, that is, the individual Christ with the church as His Body, is the fullness of God, the expression of God (Eph. 3:19). First the church is the fullness of Christ, then Christ and the church become the fullness of God. God is manifested in such a corporate Christ who is the new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:22-24; Col. 3:10-11). This new man has Christ as his Head and the church as his Body, as a universal man for God&rsquo;s expression and satisfaction. This will consummate in the New Jerusalem. God has been dispensing Himself throughout all the generations, and the ultimate issue will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. The New Jerusalem will be just the fullness of the Triune God. Even as the church today is the fullness of Christ, so in the same principle, the New Jerusalem will be the fullness of the Triune God. Looking at the New Jerusalem, you can see that God is expressed in His fullness to the uttermost. It is the Triune God expressed in full in His dispensation. That will be the fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10. At the fullness of times God will head up all things in Christ. Today God only heads up the church in Christ on a smaller scale. But when the new heaven and the new earth come, God will head up the entire universe in Christ. That will be the total expression of God through His dispensing of Himself into His chosen people throughout all the generations.</p>
<p>You all need to see this. You need a vision that will change your concepts and your view and revolutionize your entire being. Then you will hate the ethical things such as improving your behavior and character. Then you will aspire for the divine things. You will aspire for the divine dispensing of the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine glory to be increased in your being. This is the Christian life, and this is the church life. This is the life that God is after. God wants a group of people redeemed and regenerated and living by the dispensing God. We need to live by the divine dispensing. Day after day we all must be under this dispensing.</p>
