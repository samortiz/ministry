   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIED WITHOUT MATURITY IN LIFE The intention of Genesis 25 is to show that Abraham did not have the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He died without this, for as we have seen, he died without blessing anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Abraham was good, he was not mature in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is right that we appreciate him, but we must realize that he had a great lack.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was called, had faith, and lived in fellowship with God, but, to use a New Testament term, he did not have sufficient transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once again I would like to use the example of petrified wood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As water flows through the wood, the element of wood is carried away and the elements of minerals are added in its place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the mineral elements are wrought into the wood, the wood is transformed into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is petrification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are wood, and the flow of living water must carry away our natural element and bring into our being all the divine, heavenly, holy, and spiritual elements.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read chapters twenty-three through twenty-five again, you will see that Abraham was not a fully transformed person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was a man who lived in fellowship with God and who acted according to His leading, but he was not transformed in full.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, he remarried and exercised the flesh which had been dealt with by God to bring forth six more "Ishmaels."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we must be like Abraham, we need to see that in himself he was not a complete pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BURIED WITH SARAH IN THE CAVE OF MACHPELAH Undoubtedly Abraham died in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His two sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>9-10 , which he had obtained for Sarah in chapter twenty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It must be that his sons buried him according to his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>NEEDING JACOB AND ISAAC FOR HIS COMPLETION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although Abraham was good, he was not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He had to be completed and perfected by the lives of Jacob and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the implication of the divine record, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are not three separate individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, their God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, is not three gods but the one Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Abraham, we see God the Father; in Isaac, we see God the Son; and in Jacob, we see God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three-in-one, are the unique Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the same principle, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are a triune person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being three-in-one, they are a complete person in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>JACOB'S BEING CHOSEN In Abraham's record we see the matter of calling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the divine revelation, however, calling is not the first item.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's selection comes before God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Abraham was in Chaldea worshipping idols, that was the time of God's calling, not the time of His selection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The time of God's selection was before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In eternity past Abraham was chosen, and in Chaldea he was called.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But where is the record of Abraham's selection?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is in Genesis 25 in the record of Jacob's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In himself, Abraham had no selection; his selection was in Jacob's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abraham's life had neither a full beginning nor a complete ending, for he had neither selection nor maturity in life, both of which are with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, as far as the experience of life is concerned, by himself Abraham cannot stand as a complete person in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He needs Jacob and Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, represent the spiritual experience of a complete man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the record of Jacob's life, there is no mention of being called.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Where and when was Jacob called?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was called with Abraham in Genesis 11, just as Abraham was selected in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Abraham we clearly see God's calling, but we do not see selection nor the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Genesis 25 we have three genealogies: the genealogy of the children of Keturah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2-4 , the genealogy of the sons of Ishmael vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>13-16 , and the genealogy of Isaac vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>19-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the first two genealogies no one is selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>None of the sons of Keturah nor the sons of Ishmael were chosen by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even Esau, one born of Isaac, was not chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of all those named in this chapter, only one is chosen Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These three genealogies are put together in one chapter for a definite purpose to show the kind of person God rejects and the kind of person He chooses.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God chose the most naughty one, Jacob, whose name means a supplanter, a heel holder.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we were God, we would never have chosen such a naughty, supplanting one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nevertheless, Jacob was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We see in this chapter that what Abraham produced was not what God wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>None of his six sons was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In producing them, all he did was in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Likewise, none of Ishmael's descendants were chosen by God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After Isaac had been married for twenty years, he "entreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived" v. 21 . Rebekah gave birth to twins, the second of whom was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Of the more than twenty births recorded in this chapter, all were in vain except one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In this chapter God seemed to be saying to Abraham, "You have brought forth many children by your flesh, but all is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Not one who is the result of your flesh is My choice."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This chapter reveals that the life which lacks maturity will always labor in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are not matured in life, although we may be quite active, doing many things, all our labor will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>None of it is according to God's selection.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Abraham was a dear saint with a very good life, but his life was not mature and he did much which was in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nothing that came out of his flesh was God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do you want to have a life like this?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By the record of Abraham's life we see that he was not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He needed Jacob and Isaac to complete and perfect him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As this chapter reveals, for his completion and perfection he needed Jacob's being chosen.</S>
