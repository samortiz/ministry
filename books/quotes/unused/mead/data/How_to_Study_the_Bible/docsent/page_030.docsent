   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>METHODS OF STUDYING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous section we took note of the person who studies the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us now turn our attention to the method of studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In studying the Bible, we must not only be right persons, but we must also have the right methods.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We will consider the subject of method under three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we will consider the keys to studying the Bible; second, we will consider the practice; and third, we will consider the plan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHAPTER THREE KEYS TO STUDYING THE BIBLE I. BY SEARCHING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 5:39 says, "You search the Scriptures."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Acts 17:11 says, "Now these people were more noble than those in Thessalonica examining the Scriptures daily " The first thing in studying of the Bible is to examine it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word examine means "to search" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, if we want to find out anything from the Bible, we have to search for it in the Scriptures themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to look for it like rummaging through our closets for a lost article of clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We examine many things for the purpose of searching for one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among the many words that God has spoken, there is one word which we need at the present moment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is one word which will render us spiritual help at this particular time for this particular occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may have received a revelation, and we need a word to explain and express it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Or we may need to find the Scriptures' revelation concerning a certain subject.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to find these things, we have to search through God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should approach the Bible with a searching mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To search means to read with deliberation and to devote time and care to our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to study every word until we understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While we are reading we have to ask, "When was this written?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Who wrote it?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who was it written to?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Under what circumstance was this written?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What was the feeling behind this word?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why was it written?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What was the purpose for writing it?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should ask these questions one by one slowly, look for the answers carefully, and not stop until we have found what we are looking for.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes in answering a question, we have to search through the entire Old and New Testaments for things related to the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to examine the entire Bible carefully word by word, lest we miss something important through oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes we know what we are looking for in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At other times we do not even know what we are looking for.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes we only need one thing, but sometimes we need many things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our search we have to exercise the utmost care and meticulousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot allow one word or phrase to slip past us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must bear in mind that the Bible is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that every word and phrase is God's word and is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to devote the utmost attention to our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Patience is needed in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we do not understand something, we should come back to it a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should read until we understand what it says.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God enlightens us and opens our eyes the first time, we can thank the Lord for it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if He does not enlighten us or open our eyes the first time, we should go back and study it carefully the second, third, and even hundredth time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we come across anything in the Bible that we do not understand, we should not be anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need to force ourselves to mentally apprehend or understand it, and there is no need to insist on receiving light from it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Things that come from the head will not produce an "amen" from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Doctrines that are formulated by the mind are rejected by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must not study God's Word according to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, we should be patient, and search slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God's time comes, He will show us something.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A great mistake that many people make is that they do not search the Scriptures themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, they read what others have said.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No matter how much help others can render us, we have to read and search the Scriptures ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must not seek help from others all the time while neglecting to read the Bible ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, we do not despise prophecy; we need the edification of the prophets as well as those of other ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet at the same time we have to study the Bible ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot simply receive help from others while neglecting to read it ourselves.</S>
