[1]  SEPARATION FROM THE WORLD Scripture Reading: Exo 10:8-11, 21-26; 12:6-11, 37-42; 2 Cor 6:17
[2]  Egypt represents the joy of the world, Ur of the Chaldees represents the religions of the world, the tower of Babel represents the confusion of the world, and Sodom represents the sins of the world.
[3]  As soon as you are redeemed by the blood, you become a sojourner and a pilgrim on the earth; you have to go out of Egypt and be separated from the world immediately.
[4]  The story of Israel's exodus from Egypt shows us how difficult it was for them to leave Egypt!
[5]  Today we Christians must come out of the system and the organization of the world.
[6]  Leaving the world refers to our deliverance from the moral world, not the physical world.
[7]  In other words, we are still living in the world, but this world has become a wilderness to us.
[8]  Mr. D. M. Panton put it well when he said, "While I am living, it is a journey to me; when I die, it is a tomb to me." While a believer is living on this earth, the world is a journey to him; when he dies, the world is only a tomb in which he is buried.
[9]  The world wants to keep our people and our treasure, but if these things are kept in the world, we will not be able to serve our God.
[10]  Galatians 6:14 shows us that the cross stands between the world and the Lord.
[11]  The Lord is on one side, and the world is on the other side.
[12]  As soon as we go to the Lord, we will find out what the world is and what the world is not.
[13]  But we should grasp one basic principle: everything that quenches one's spiritual life in the Lord is the world.
[14]  Things which stumble a weak conscience are another class of things that constitute the world.
[15]  If a Gentile thinks that we should not do a certain thing, we will lose our testimony if we do it.
[16]  Second Corinthians 6:17-18 says, "Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you'; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.'"
