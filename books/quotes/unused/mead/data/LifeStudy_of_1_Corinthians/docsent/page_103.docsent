   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE OFFSCOURING OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE SCUM OF ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter four of 1 Corinthians is very intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see a father rebuking, instructing, correcting, and even disciplining his mistaken children in an intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we read this chapter, we can sense the intimacy between the writer and the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After pointing out that the apostles have become a spectacle to the world, Paul goes on to say in verse 10, We are fools because of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, but we are dishonored.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostles were willing to be foolish by forsaking their human wisdom for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the fleshly Corinthian believers remained prudent in their natural wisdom, while claiming they were in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul did not say that they were philosophers because of Christ; he declares that they were fools because of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a sense, every believer in Christ must become a fool.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many who were wise in this world have become fools of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But although the apostles had become fools because of Christ, the Corinthians sought to remain prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 10 Paul also says, We are weak, but you are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The apostles while ministering Christ appeared to be weak, for they used no strength or power of their natural being 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the fleshly Corinthian believers were strong, claiming prominence among the believers by exercising their natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 10 Paul also tells the Corinthians, You are glorious, but we are dishonored.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Corinthian believers were glorious, or honorable, in a display of splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the apostles were dishonored and despised by the glory-seeking Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By this we can see that the Corinthians were altogether wrong in their way of running the Christian course.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In verses 11 through 13 Paul continues, Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and beaten and wander without a home; and we labor, working with our own hands; being reviled we bless, being persecuted we bear it, being defamed we appeal.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Defamed means insulted, spoken of injuriously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To appeal here is to entreat with exhortation, consolation, and encouragement in order to appease.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 13 Paul says, We have become as the offscouring of the world, as the scum of all things until now.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Offscouring and scum are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Offscouring denotes that which is thrown away in cleansing; hence, refuse, filth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Scum denotes that which is wiped off; hence, rubbish, refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both synonyms are metaphorically used, especially of condemned criminals of the lowest class, who were cast into the sea or to the wild beasts in the amphitheater.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here Paul likens himself to the lowest criminals, to offscouring, scum, rubbish, refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Compared to many of my friends from the past, I also am scum and offscouring.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have become very successful and have acquired much wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They regard me as a fool and wonder what I have been doing with my life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Occasionally I meet friends from many years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When they ask me what I have been doing, I am not sure how to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have become extremely successful, but we have become the offscouring of the world and the scum of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are qualified only to be cast aside as waste.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was Paul s estimation of himself with respect to both the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE BEGETTING FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 14 through 21 are the most intimate portion of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we see that Paul was a begetting father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He seems to be saying to the Corinthians, Yes, I am scum and offscouring.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But I am a father who has begotten many children.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 14 Paul says, Not as shaming you am I writing these things, but as my beloved children I admonish you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If I had been one of the believers receiving this Epistle at Corinth, I would have been ashamed after reading the first thirteen verses of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I would have said to myself, My spiritual father says that we are exalting ourselves, but he considers himself as offscouring and scum.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This makes me feel ashamed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, Paul says that he wrote these things not to shame them, but to admonish them as his beloved children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Greek word rendered guides literally means child-conductors, as in Galatians 3:24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Guides, child-conductors, give instructions and directions to the children under their guardianship; fathers impart life to their children whom they beget.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The apostle was such a father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He had begotten the Corinthian believers in Christ through the gospel, imparting the divine life into them so that they became children of God and members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 16 continues, I appeal therefore to you, become imitators of me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Greek word for appeal is the same as that used in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In appealing to the Corinthians to imitate him, Paul seems to be saying, My children, don t be kings, but be willing to be despised as criminals in the sight of men.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Don t be philosophers, but be offscouring and scum.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Turn from what you were in the past and become imitators of me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today we, the apostles, are despised before man for the sake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have become fools because of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have been made a spectacle to angels and to men, we are like criminals sentenced to death, and we are scum and offscouring.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But to you I am a begetting father.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In verse 17 Paul says, Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The ways here refer to the ways in which the apostle conducted himself as he taught the saints in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The expression everywhere in every church indicates two things: first, that the apostle s teaching is the same universally, not varying from place to place; second, that everywhere equals every church and that every church equals everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This Epistle was brought to the Corinthians by Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, Paul not only wrote an Epistle; he also sent a co-worker to visit the Corinthians with this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By this we see that Paul had intimate and personal contact with the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In verses 18 and 19 Paul tells the Corinthians, Now some have been puffed up as though I were not coming to you; but I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This was Paul s answer to those Corinthians who were asking why Paul himself did not come to them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some were puffed up, thinking that he would not visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But Paul says that if the Lord wills, he will come to Corinth shortly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If it were up to him, he would definitely come.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But, according to the New Testament way of speaking, Paul inserted the words if the Lord wills to indicate that the Lord may not send him there.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, if the Lord wills, he will come.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But if the Lord does not will that he visit the Corinthians, there is nothing Paul can do about it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In verses 19 and 20 Paul says, I will know not the speech of those who have been puffed up, but the power; for the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul s word about the kingdom of God refers to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This implies that in the sense of authority the church in this age is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Paul knew that the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For this reason, he wanted to know the power of those who were puffed up.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Verse 21 is the conclusion of this chapter: What do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This word is spoken to the Corinthian believers based upon the consideration that the apostle is their spiritual father.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As such, he has the position and responsibility to chastise his children.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A spirit of meekness here refers to the apostle s regenerated spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The spirit of meekness is one that is saturated with the meekness of Christ 2 Cor 10:1 to express the virtue of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>According to Paul s word in verse 21, was he happy or unhappy, angry or meek?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I would say that in this chapter he is unhappy and happy as well, angry and meek as well.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This definitely does not mean, however, that Paul is two-faced.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Rather, it reveals that a genuinely spiritual person can be meek and then immediately become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In fact, a spiritual person can be meek even while he is angry.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If you are not spiritual, it may take a few days for your anger to subside.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But the anger of a spiritual person can vanish instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Suppose a brother offends you, and you become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If it takes a long time for your anger to go away, this proves that you are not a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The faster your anger disappears, the more spiritual you are.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Sisters, if you cannot be angry with your husband one minute and meek toward him the next, your spirituality is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If you need several hours to turn from your anger and become happy with your husband, you have only a man-made spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Paul was a person who could be angry one moment and happy the next.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This shows that he was truly a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Thus, it is correct to say that in this chapter he was both angry with the Corinthians and meek toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Sisters, once you have become angry with your husband, how long does it take before your anger goes away?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Will it be days before you speak to him again and are happy with him?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Elders, if you are offended by another elder, how long will it take for you to get over this offense?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Will it take a week before you can have pleasant fellowship with the one who offended you?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The elders may give messages on spirituality, but they may not know how to be genuinely spiritual with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It certainly is not true spirituality for a brother to take several days to get over an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In 1 Corinthians 4 we see that Paul was quite unhappy with the Greek believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>However, his unhappiness could suddenly vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He could ask in verse 21 whether they wanted him to come to them with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Is this a word of anger or of meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is rather difficult to say, for Paul was actually angry and meek at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If we do not know how to be angry in a proper way, we cannot be genuinely spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In fact, we cannot be truly human either.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Instead, we shall be like statues, lacking human feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The more spiritual we are, the easier it will be for us to become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If you never get angry quickly, that is an indication that you are not truly spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Some may consider such a thought about spirituality as very mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>However, from experience I know that it is a fact that the more spiritual we are, the easier it will be to become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The reason for this is that when we are truly spiritual, we are genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We do not hide, and we do not pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>If you live with me for a long period of time and are never angry with me, I will not have any confidence in you.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Probably you are a good politician.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>I cannot believe that you could live with me for many months without being offended by me.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>I fully realize that certain things I do are offensive to others.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>If someone can stay with me and not be offended by me, it must be because his spirituality is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>He must be a person without flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>But since we all are persons of flesh and blood, we all know what it is to be angry.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>However, if we are political with one another, we shall conceal our anger.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>But a truly spiritual person will not hide his anger.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>On the one hand, he may be quick to become angry; on the other hand, he will be just as quick to turn from his anger.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Consider again what Paul says in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>He asks, What do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Does this sound like a verse from the holy Scriptures?</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>If this word were not in the Bible, none of us would accept such a statement as worthy of being in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>It may appear scriptural for someone to say, The time is short, My people.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>I come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>I love you, and you must love Me. Thus saith the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>But does it sound biblical or spiritual to ask whether we should come with a rod or in love and a spirit of meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Verse 21 sounds like the writing of someone who is angry.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Nevertheless, these words are recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Once again we see that the Bible is different from any other book.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Suppose I am angry with a certain brother one minute and then, very soon afterwards, I am quite happy with him.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>He may be offended and criticize me for not being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>However, his spirituality may not be genuine, whereas my spirituality may be real.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>To repeat, a person who is truly spiritual can quickly go from meekness to anger or from anger to meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>I have a deep appreciation for chapter four of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>In this chapter we see a humanity which is very genuine, a humanity without pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Yet, this humanity is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>If we read Paul s words again and again, especially if we pray-read them, we shall touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Although verse 21 may not sound like a very scriptural way of speaking, it is a verse full of the weight of life.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>On the contrary, to utter certain words followed by, Thus saith the Lord, may be completely lacking in life.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 4 is full of the weight of life.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>We all need to learn from Paul to have a genuine spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>If we are truly spiritual, we shall not hide, we shall not pretend, and we shall not play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Rather, we shall have a genuine humanity and simply be what we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>This is the kind of life which can dispense the unsearchable riches of Christ into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Those who possess this kind of humanity are qualified to be stewards in God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>All the elders need to have the kind of humanity illustrated in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>Only those elders with a genuine humanity can build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>Those who are clever, political, and who never offend others and never make mistakes cannot build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>However, I do not mean that those who are careless can be useful in building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>My point here is that elders with a true humanity, a humanity without pretense, can build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>All the saints need to have this kind of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Both in the church life and in married life, we need to be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>We should not hide or pretend, but, like Paul, have a genuine humanity and a true spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>On the one hand, we need to be as offscouring and scum; on the other hand we need to be begetting fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>If we are not offscouring and scum and also begetting fathers, our work will have little impact.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>We may preach the right things doctrinally, but with little result.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>A begetting father, one who imparts life to others, must be as a criminal condemned to death in the sight of man.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>He must be regarded as useless, as a fool, as offscouring and scum.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>If we live such a life before man, then we shall be fathers able to beget many children.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>This means that if we would impart life to others, we must be despised in the eyes of man.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>This is especially true today in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>In order to be a life-imparter, you must be despised by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>The worldly Christians should say that you are an offscouring, scum.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Then you will become a life-imparting and begetting father.</S>
