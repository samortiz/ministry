   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SHAPING OF THE LAMPSTAND Gold Added to Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How did this lampstand come about?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have not only been cleansed by the precious blood; we have also been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This new birth implies that there is another life and therefore a father is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we have been born again, we have a life which has its source in the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outwardly we have been cleansed; inwardly we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now God is our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It follows naturally that we have His nature, just as every son bears his father's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:11-12 says that those who receive Christ are born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are called "partakers of the divine nature" in 2 Peter 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Pure gold has come into us!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From Clay to Gold</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By our first birth we are men of clay, formed of the dust of the ground Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"The first man is of the earth, earthy" 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we die, we return to the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" Gen 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before we were regenerated, we were men of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One day, however, we got saved, and God came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now, instead of being men of clay, we are men of gold!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Look at yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is gold in you!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because God is your Father, you have His substance and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But do you have the form of the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To have the shape of the Son means that there has been some transformation in you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit" 2 Cor 3:18, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>. How much of the Lord's image do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This depends on the amount of transformation you have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yes, you have gold within, but it is surrounded by the clay and has not yet taken shape.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In your living, does the clay come out or the gold?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Need for Christ to Be Formed in Us</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church, however, is a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not made of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since we are part gold and part clay, we are partly the church and partly not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The golden lampstand is buried in the clay!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is yet to be formed in us Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has been revealed in us 1:16 and lives in us 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now the gold within needs to take shape.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We know there is something shiny and weighty inside us; this substance must be formed into the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of this gold, we hesitate to say that we are not the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet there is so much clay still clinging to us that we wonder if we can be considered the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are in this mixed condition, can we call ourselves the church?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is the practical expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Father enters into man to be his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Son is in man transforming him to be the form.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the Spirit in man expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus the church is depicted as a golden lampstand Rev 1:20b .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE LAMPSTAND IN EXODUS, ZECHARIAH, AND REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are three phases to the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first is in Exodus in the tabernacle, where it represents the Triune God Exo 25:31-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The second is in Zechariah, where it represents the children of Israel who are in the position of receiving grace Zech 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who thus receive grace, before God are His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The last is in the New Testament, where the golden lampstand is the church Rev 1:12, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This testimony declares that the substance of the Father has been wrought into the believers; the shape of the Son has also been constituted into them; and the expression of the Spirit is realized through them.</S>
