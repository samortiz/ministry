   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LAYING THE FOUNDATION OF MAINTAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the coordination we should not have the thought that if one place does not suit us, we can move to another place.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we leave, we should not expect our work to be blessed by the Lord or that our conscience will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, our conscience will not be sensitive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, it will be easy to regard a new place as our domain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, as a result of fellowship and communication among the churches, the saints in the new locality will not be supportive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In another ten or twenty years the Lord will lead many among us to go abroad to other continents and work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By that time, it will be very common to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, we must begin now to lay a good foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, we should maintain a good relationship with the unbelieving ones in our community; we should not be rude to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if others in our community are pagans, we should not be rude to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Concerning our relatives, we should conduct ourselves according to the teaching of the Bible and try our best to maintain a good relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second, we should be the same in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not have a different attitude toward the saints who do not meet with us; rather, we should maintain a good relationship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Third, we should maintain a good relationship with the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This relationship is not only local or limited to a country; it is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>SEEKING THE LORD S LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>FOR THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of the full-timers among us are not novices.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have received some training and have also spent many years serving in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that these ones will pray and seek the Lord s leading concerning the propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gospelizing Taiwan is not a slogan; it is the present direction of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no arrangement, no centralized authority, and no uniform practice among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We follow life, and we allow every saint to be led by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is best for two brothers and perhaps one sister to go together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With regard to their livelihood, we have fellowshipped that the full-timers should be supported; that is, their daily necessities should be taken care of by their localities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But there will be other needs related to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, we should exercise faith and believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, the saints should pray for the co-workers who go out to labor for the Lord, and the saints should support them financially.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, those who go out should have a spirit of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yes, the church will take care of our need, but we still need to give everything to the Lord; we should learn to have faith, to pray, and to look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church cannot go with us, but the Lord is going with us and the prayers of the saints will go with us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I arrived in America in 1963, my pockets were empty and the situation was rather difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I still did my best to take care of the needs of the other co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would rather have suffered lack than have the other co-workers suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the kind of spirit we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must seek the Lord s leading and pray for the places that need co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should also fellowship with one another and with older co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not wait for the church to seek the Lord on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should seek the Lord in order to know where to go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are the ones seeking the Lord, and we are the ones fighting the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we go to a new place, we must learn to establish a good fellowship with the local saints and maintain a proper relationship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we should not depend on them for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I went to America, I was already sixty years old, but I had to learn to cook for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must learn to take care of our practical needs and the needs of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should learn to do everything necessary to carry out our function.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should even learn to write tracts to take care of the local situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In America some sisters worked during the day and served in the meeting hall at night.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Western missionaries who went to China served in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we should not expect others to do anything that we are unwilling to do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At present our urgent need is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The kind of people we will contact when we go out and the way to contact them are the matters that will need further prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May the Lord lead us.</S>
