   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord predicted that one day Peter would be a submissive person, not only submissive to God's will, God's hand, but also submissive to all of his environment without any resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we have the maturity in life, we can say, "No matter what happens to me, no matter what betides, I will not resist."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need the mature ones in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The young ones know how to fight, but they do not know how to be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be coordinated requires a certain degree of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have only life without growth, there will be fighting in the church life all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need the growth in life for the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter was a bold and strong man, but the Lord told him that the day would come when someone would gird him and bring him to a place where he did not want to go, yet he would still go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the Lord said, "Follow Me" 21:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we love the Lord, that will afford us an outflow of life to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But to be submissive in the will affords us the ability to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are going to follow Him, we need a real subduing of our will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You need a submissive will, but it cannot come to you overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You need the growth in life, bit by bit, until you have the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The local church is not only a place where you can receive life but also a place where you can grow in life to be matured in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The real growth in life is, positively, the increase of Christ within you, and negatively, the decrease of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This decrease is in the change of your mind, the subduing of your will, and the stirring up of your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In John 12:25 the Lord said, "He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to lose the soul-life, the psuche, to participate in the eternal life, the zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We lose the soul-life for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to lose the soul-life, the natural life, in three directions: in the change of the mind, in the subduing of the will, and in the stirring up of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Day by day we need the fresh renewing of our mind, the subduing of our will, and the stirring up of our emotion so that our emotion is on fire for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This needs to take place continually until we become a mature person in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more you are matured, the more submissive you will be in your will to the Lord, to the environment, to the church, and to all the brothers and sisters around you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then there will be no problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to grow in life by drinking the Lord, feeding on Him, abiding in Him, and breathing Him in. We also have to continually have a change of mind, have our will subdued, and have our emotion stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The entire soul-life must be lost for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then day by day the church life will be strengthened and built up.</S>
