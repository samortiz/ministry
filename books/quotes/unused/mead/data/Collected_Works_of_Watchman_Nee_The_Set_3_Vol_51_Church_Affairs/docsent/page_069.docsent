   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Barnabas</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, the gospel was spreading in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria, and we see the conversion of Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the brothers in Jerusalem suffered persecution, some went to different places.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people in these places believed in the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the church in Jerusalem sent out another person, Barnabas, to go out and visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He went as far as Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he arrived at Antioch, he helped the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After a period of time, Barnabas heard about Saul, and he went to Tarsus to seek for Saul and brought him to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then Barnabas spent a whole year in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Barnabas did not have official duties in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That is why he could live outside of Jerusalem for a year.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not have to return to Jerusalem like Peter or John, because he was not an elder in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can say that, within this year, Saul received edification from Barnabas.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After a period of time, due to a great famine, the brothers in Judea became quite poor and suffered greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The brothers in Antioch sent money to the elders in Jerusalem through Barnabas and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the money was for local use, it was sent to the elders instead of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later, several prophets and teachers were raised up in the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Barnabas was one of them, and Saul was also one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the Holy Spirit ordered that Barnabas and Saul be set apart to be apostles and sent out to work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Up to this point, Barnabas was in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was Barnabas who established the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church in Antioch was not established by Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was Barnabas who came down from Jerusalem to establish the church in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the church in Antioch sent money to Jerusalem, they sent it through Barnabas and Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Saul was the one who followed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Holy Spirit came to send people out to work from among the prophets and teachers, the Scripture says, "The Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them'' Acts 13:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Barnabas was still in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God Being the God of Authority</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>and the God of Order</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Please remember that in God's work and in the church of God there can never be a situation in which there is no order.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to see before God that even with two people, one is put ahead of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When ten people are together, there will be one in front and nine in the back.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When twelve are together, one will be in front and eleven will be in the back.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is always the God of authority and the God of order.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is never a committee system of three or five men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no such thing in the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There may be several elders, but God does not establish a committee.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although God does not set up a chairman, we need to listen to the one whom God establishes among the elders when carrying out the Lord's affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today when we talk about the matter of the work, it is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There were twelve apostles in Jerusalem, but God placed Peter in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The rest of the eleven had to wait in the back and listen to what he said.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The James that we spoke of earlier was not the older brother of John.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The older brother of John had already passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This James was in the forefront in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to see this matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only do we have Barnabas and Saul, but Barnabas was spontaneously ahead of Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the work there are always those in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If two sisters have learned the lesson of recognizing authority, they will immediately realize that one of them needs to stand on the ground of obedience when they are together.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first thing in the coordination of the work is the coordination of the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once we do not have the coordination of authority, all the other coordinations are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please note that God's word in the Bible is very fine and detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then...''</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1 Cor 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must see that God is not a God of confusion but a God of order.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God does not believe in disorder or confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God believes in order, and God is a God of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That is why He says "first.''</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It does not mean that there is a system of organization or committees, in which everyone has the right to speak and vote.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God does not recognize this at all.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is man's way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In His Word God says, "First...second...third...then...''</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the arrangement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, when the brothers come to work in the church or in any matter, they must see their own place.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They must learn to line up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today if three people are walking together, they should know spontaneously which brother is in front of them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If they have a question, they should ask that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the principle of the church here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is very beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When two or three brothers are together and something happens, some should immediately take the position of obedience and ask, "Since this matter must be decided, what do you say?''</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even when two are together, we should know who stands before us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not a matter of ordination or assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we have to assign, then things have been spoiled already.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is obvious that some stand in the forefront and some stand behind.</S>
