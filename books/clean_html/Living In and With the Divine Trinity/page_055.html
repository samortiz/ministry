To live with the Divine Trinity is the enjoyment and the experience of the Divine Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST BECOMING<br>POWER AND WISDOM TO US FROM GOD:<br>BOTH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND<br>SANCTIFICATION AND REDEMPTION</H2><P>To live with the Divine Trinity is to have Christ become power and wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). Christ is both power and wisdom from God to us. "To us" indicates a transmission. This is similar to the electricity installed into a building. In order to experience and apply the electricity, the switch must be turned on. Then there is the transmission of the electricity. Christ is both power and wisdom transmitted from God to us like the transmission of electricity. This transmission is not once for all. We use the electricity in a building day after day. Day after day we switch on the electricity to enjoy the transmission of electricity. In the same way, we need to enjoy the continual transmission of Christ as power and wisdom from God to us.</P><P>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ as our wisdom is all-inclusive. Christ became wisdom to us from God as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Righteousness is for our past. By Christ as our righteousness, we have been justified by God that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life (Rom. 5:18). Sanctification is for our present. By Christ as our sanctification, we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will with His divine life (6:19, 22). Redemption is for our future. Christ as our redemption is for the redemption of our body (8:23), by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21). Righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are included in Christ as our wisdom. This wisdom is to us from God as a continual transmission for our experience and enjoyment.</P><P>It is of God that we are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30a). We were put into Christ by God so that He could be both power and wisdom to us in a continuous way. This has been revealed to us through the Spirit (2:10). The unveiling Spirit reveals the depths of God to us through God's holy Word for our deep experience and deep enjoyment. First Corinthians 6:19 says that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in us, whom we have from God. The Spirit is the means, the element, and the sphere for our experience of the wonderful Christ. Our body is a temple for the unveiling Spirit. We have to treasure the fact that our body is a holy temple, sanctified for the consummated Spirit of the Triune God. He is lodged in our being, taking our being as His dwelling place.</P><P>Because of the indwelling Spirit in our spirit, we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). It is a wonder that our human spirit is mingled or joined with the divine Spirit into one! The two spirits have been merged into one spirit. The relationship between us and God has arrived at such a marvelous state that we and God are one in the spirit. As proper, normal Christians we must learn to remain in our spirit. We should always come back to our spirit, exercise our spirit, and use our spirit. To experience and enjoy God, Christ, and the Spirit, we need to be in our spirit all the time. We should always stay here and dwell here. We need to be those enjoying the Triune God in our spirit.</P><P>First Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all given to drink one Spirit. First, the Spirit dwells in us. Then He becomes our drink. The Spirit of God is our drink, and the Word of God is our food. Day by day we should eat the Word of God and drink the Spirit of God as our living water.</P><P>All of the items of Christ revealed in the book of 1 Corinthians can only be experienced and enjoyed by us in and through the all-inclusive Spirit. God has made Christ our power and wisdom in and through the Spirit.</P>
