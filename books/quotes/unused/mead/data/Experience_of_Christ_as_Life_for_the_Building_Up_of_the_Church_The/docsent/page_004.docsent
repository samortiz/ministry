   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RIVER OF LIFE FLOWING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE THRONE OF GOD AND OF THE LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 22:1 says that the river of life flows out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is one throne, but how can two persons sit on one throne?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may say that the Bible tells us that Jesus is sitting at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So it must be that God is sitting at the left and Jesus is sitting at the right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But actually there is not one throne for two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 21 tells us that Christ is the lamp v. 23 , and we know that God is the light 1 John 1:5 . The light is within the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the throne there is not only God but also the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God as the light is within the Lamb as the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is the Lamb-God, which means that He is the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Genesis 1 does not say that in the beginning God and the Lamb created the heaven and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It simply says, "In the beginning God..."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But at the end of the Bible there are God and the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is God plus something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the beginning is God, but at the end is God plus the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now He is not only God but also the Lamb-God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Out of God who is in Christ, out of the redeeming God, flows the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The river of life is simply the flowing of life, just as the current of electricity is the flowing of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The river of life is life flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the river of life is God in Christ as the Spirit flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the flowing of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Life is simply the Triune God flowing into us, through us, and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The pictures presented in the Bible, especially in Genesis and Revelation, are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation shows us that God as the light is in the Lamb as the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Out of the throne of the Lamb-God flows the river of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This signifies that God in Christ as the Spirit the Triune God flows out to be received by us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We receive Him by drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you drink of Him, He will flow into you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you cooperate with Him some more, He will flow through you and out of you as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 7 tells us that what we drink and what flows out of us is the Spirit, who is God Himself vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, life is God in three persons flowing into us, through us, and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>HOW GOD FLOWS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we need to consider how God flows.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible shows us that God flows mainly in two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, He flowed by being incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was in eternity in the heavens, dwelling in unapproachable light 1 Tim 6:16 , but one day He became incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He came down to the earth to dwell among people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this incarnated One, there was life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Incarnation was the first step that God took to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But this first step merely brought Him to the earth among people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He still could not get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, He had to take a second step, the step of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first step was incarnation, and the second step was resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to be resurrected, He had to suffer death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By death He was brought into resurrection, and through resurrection He finished the second step of His flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By the first step, He was incarnated to be a man with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the second step, He was transformed, changed in form, into the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In resurrection He is now the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now He is not merely able to be on this earth among human beings, but He is also able to enter into us, His believers.</S>
