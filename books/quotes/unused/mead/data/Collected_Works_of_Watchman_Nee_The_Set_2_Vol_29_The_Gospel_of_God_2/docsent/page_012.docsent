   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BEING THE ONE WHO KEEPS US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am not saying that we should forget about the difficult passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will address those passages in the next message.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there are many positive things which are undeniable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only do we have the prayer of the Lord Jesus and the functioning of the Lord Jesus as our High Priest; the Bible records many other items besides.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our salvation does not depend merely on our believing, but it also depends on the keeping power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not we who are keeping ourselves, but the power of God that is keeping us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are kept by the same condition that enabled us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The condition for receiving is the condition for keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is impossible to have one condition for receiving and another condition for keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By grace we received God's salvation; by grace we also enjoy God's preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we say that salvation is by grace but preservation is by works, we have never read the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have studied the books of Romans and Galatians many times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans talks specifically about sinners; Galatians talks specifically about believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans says that man cannot be justified by works, and Galatians says that man cannot keep his justification by works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans tells us that sinners cannot trust in works; Galatians tells us that believers cannot trust in works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans tells us that the sinners' justification before God has nothing to do with the law and works; Galatians tells us that the believers' preservation by grace likewise has nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Having begun by the Spirit, should we be perfected by the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having begun by faith, should we be perfected by the law?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, Romans is for unbelievers and speaks from the angle of unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Galatians is for believers and speaks from the angle of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the receiving of grace before God is free, the keeping of salvation before God must also be free.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible shows us quite clearly that it is God rather than we ourselves who keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Peter 1:5 says, "Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The last step of salvation is redemption at the coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salvation can be divided into three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The salvation spoken of here refers to our redemption at the coming again of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through faith we are being guarded by the power of God unto redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are we the ones who hold fast to God, or is God the One who holds fast to us?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is it we who keep ourselves, or are we kept by God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible says that it is God who keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The guarding by the power of God implies that if I were to become lost, the responsibility would not be mine, but God's. I speak reverently, that if we were to be lost, more responsibility would fall on God than on us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we should not have any thought at all that Christians can be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will talk about this issue in the next few messages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The problem today is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Salvation is altogether something to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose I leave a seal with Brother Ma because I have to take care of some matters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If Brother Ma loses my seal, whose responsibility is that, mine or Brother Ma's?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that I am partly wrong for trusting in Brother Ma; but the direct responsibility lies with Brother Ma because I have entrusted my seal to him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I handed myself over to God, and later I were to lose my salvation, indeed I would have made a mistake in trusting God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the mistake would be directly with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It would be God who would be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are preserved because of the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who do not know God may say that the power of God would be inadequate to keep us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But all who know God have to bow down and say, "We who are being guarded by the power of God through faith will definitely receive the salvation ready to be revealed at the last time."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter was quite sure that we will receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No matter what happens, we will be fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why will we be fully saved?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second Timothy 1:12 says, "For I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever Paul had deposited in the Lord, the Lord would guard unto the day He returns.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we are saved all the way until that day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many times I consider what would happen if one day I, Watchman Nee, were to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My perdition would not be a big thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, for God's glory to suffer loss would be a big thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For me to go to hell and perish would not matter very much, but the loss of God's glory would matter a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>My perdition would not be that important.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if I were to perish, God would surely not be glorified; His glory would surely be damaged, because it would indicate that God does not guard well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I were to perish, that would be because God did not keep me well.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On account of God's glory, all those who know God and His keeping power would say that there is no way for them to lose God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have no way to lose it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Word of God is more than clear in this respect.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Concerning the verses on keeping, the one I like the most is Jude 24-25a.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is more peculiar than any of the other verses.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It tells us what the name of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The name of God is "Him who is able to guard you from stumbling and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation, to the only God our Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What is God's name?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's name is the One who is able to guard us from stumbling; God's name is the One who is able to set us before His glory without blemish in exultation; God's name is the One who is the only God our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is it to not stumble?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It does not say that God will keep us from falling, but that He will keep us from stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To fall is to lie down on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But to stumble is only to make a slip.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He says that God can keep us from slipping.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Not only can God keep us from falling, but He can keep us from slipping.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>No teaching in the Bible can have the sinners as its starting point; all teachings must have the Lord Jesus as the starting point.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It would be terrible if sinners were taken as the starting point; but if the Lord Jesus is taken as the starting point, things will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we take the sinners as the starting point, the problem of sin will become obscure to us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There will be many things that we will not consider as sins.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many filthy matters will be regarded as clean; many matters that are weak will be considered as very strong; many shameful things will be considered as glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even after we have become a Christian, we still consider many sinful things as glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>With those who know God, there are still many sins which have not been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There are still many sins that a Christian considers as glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If a believer is unclear concerning the matter of sin, how much more will a sinner be unclear?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There are many sins that God has already judged in the Lord Jesus, but that were not manifested as sins to us when we were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Only after we believed in the Lord Jesus have we become clear that those were sins.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we were sinners, we were not clear; only after we believed in the Lord Jesus were we clear.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, even Christians are not trustworthy; there are still many things which they do not see.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Concerning the losing of one's salvation, if we consider the matter from man's viewpoint, we will never see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we consider the truths of the Bible from our own viewpoint, everything will become confusing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We may think that one thing is greater than others.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is only when we consider things from the Lord's viewpoint that we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The question is not whether one is able to keep his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The question is whether or not the Lord Jesus is able to guard his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The proper view is one which stems from the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If it is up to us to keep our salvation, we may not even be able to keep it for two hours, much less two days.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But if it is the Lord Jesus who does the keeping, even if a righteous person were to stumble seven times a day, he would still be able to get up.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is not we who are able, but God who is able.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we turn towards ourselves, our eyes will be in the wrong direction.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Bible tells us that we should look away unto Jesus, who is the Author and Perfecter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The keeping power is the Lord's and not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We can trust in God because it is God who keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The question today is: What method is God using to keep us?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Today we have given our life to God.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But how will God keep us until the day of the coming of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There is no other way but for God to hide our life together with the Lord's life in Him Col 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>As I read this verse, I am so overjoyed that I could laugh out loud.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Nothing can be better than this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I do not know if many Christians know how good this verse is.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is impossible to lose the life that God gave to us, because our life and that of the Lord are already hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I remember when I was still an unbeliever, as a student, once I finished writing something very important.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I told my schoolmate that it was a very important matter and that I would not sell it even for five thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I had to go out for a while, and I asked him to keep it safely for me.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I gave him that sheet of paper and left.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When I came back, I asked him for the paper.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He said that he could not give it to me, because after I had said that it was so important, he soaked it in water and swallowed it into his stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>He patted his stomach and assured me that the paper was there and that it would never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>That day I did not know whether to laugh or to cry about it.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>That sheet of paper was in his stomach; it would never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>But neither would it ever be taken out.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>It was indeed very secure.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>What God has done today is something more secure.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>God has hidden our life together with that of Christ in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Where can we find it now?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>How could we lose it again?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>God's life to us could only be lost if God Himself were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Thank God that God will never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>As a result, the life He put within a Christian can never be lost either.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The life of a Christian is securely kept; it is kept in God.</S>
