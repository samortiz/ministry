   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In America</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The current of the world never reverses its course or flows backward.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Similarly, the flow of the gospel brought us from mainland China to Taiwan and then to America.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ever since my youth, our family had been in contact with some American missionaries, so I understood them very well.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A hundred years ago, American missionaries who went to China had to travel by boat for six months.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Often they got serious motion sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some died right after they reached the land and were buried there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some remained in China for at least six to seven years before they could return to their country for a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I know much about the hardships they experienced in their labor for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1938 a saint in Beijing sent me a monetary offering which included two checks one in the amount of sixteen hundred American dollars and the other in the amount of twelve hundred Chinese yuan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sender enclosed a letter which read, Brother Lee, I studied in America.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After listening to your preaching of the word, I feel it is truly what America needs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please go to America!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The check for sixteen hundred American dollars is for your round-trip tickets by boat and your living expenses in America.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The check for twelve hundred Chinese yuan is for your family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have calculated that they will need at most one hundred yuan each month, so this money is enough to cover a year s family expenditure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Immediately after I received the letter, I wrote a reply, saying, I am sorry, but I do not have the interest or the burden to go to America.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What should I do with these two checks?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This saint wrote again and said, Do not return the checks to me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Put them in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that one day the Lord will take you to America.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I deposited the money in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Afterward, because of the change of the political situation in China, the currency changed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the end, that amount of money was worth only a little.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1948 some churches in Southeast Asia invited me to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I had just received my passport in Nanking and was about to take the trip, but due to the political situation, our whole family migrated to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Taiwan we did not have the slightest thought of going to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During that time I published a magazine called The Ministry of the Word, which contains many messages concerning service.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In those messages I often referred to the fact that in bringing us to Taiwan the Lord had put us in a wonderful geographical setting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To the south we could go to Southeast Asia, to the east we could go to Japan and Korea, and at the same time we could take care of mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Southeast Asia there were a great number of overseas Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As to Japan and Korea, both are very close to the Chinese in culture and writing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In addition, of course, mainland China is a vast land.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In those messages I never mentioned anything about the Western world, because I felt that we had no connection with it in terms of culture and language.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Actually, I did not have the intention to labor in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since I had been invited, however, I went to the Philippines near the end of 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From then on, for about eleven years, I went every year and stayed for at most three or four months each time, mainly in Manila.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I did not go to any other places.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the Lord did not go along with my concept.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He stirred up my environment to thrust me to the West.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I came to the United States the first time in 1958.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That was because of an invitation which I received from England and Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I went to Europe, first I stayed in England for a month.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then I went to Denmark and stayed there for about ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On my return trip I stopped in America for a short while.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Two years later I came to America again; at that time I had a deeper impression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a year I came to America again, and my impression of it was even deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That was twenty-three years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There were not many Chinese who went there to study, nor were there many Chinese who immigrated there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that point I was clear inwardly that I should receive the burden to come and labor in America.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, I applied for immigration.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The lawyer told me that America gave the Chinese a quota of only one hundred and five.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Chinese who were already in America had applied for their families to come, and the number of applicants had already exceeded ten thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, if I were to follow the normal procedure, I would have to wait one hundred years for my turn.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fortunately, since I was considered a preacher and because I had written many books, my application was quickly approved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE CHINESE-SPEAKING WORK IN AMERICA</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Soon after that, Kennedy became the president of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He proposed a revision of the immigration law to remove racial discrimination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every country would be given a quota of 20,000, but the total number of immigrants could not exceed 300,000 yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From the Americas 130,000 would be allowed, while from the other four continents 170,000 would be allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The applications would be approved on a first-come, first-served basis.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 1966 Congress passed the new immigration law, and in the next year the implementation of the new law began.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>From that year on, five countries have met their maximum quota every year; these are China, India, South Korea, the Philippines, and Greece or Italy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some of the countries did not fill up their quotas, so the Chinese were given more opportunity to come.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In addition, a great number of Chinese with special qualifications applied under other categories.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, within seventeen years, there were approximately 500,000 new Chinese immigrants.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In 1982 when Reagan became the president, he felt that the Chinese immigrants were performing very well in America, so he gave them special treatment with a double portion 20,000 for Taiwan and another 20,000 for mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From that time on, there have been 40,000 new Chinese immigrants in America every year.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Right now the Chinese make up the largest number of immigrants coming to America per year.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Chinese immigrants first choice of residence, which may be related to where their relatives live, is Southern California, and their second choice is New York.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Among the new immigrants, many are Christians, including the saints who are in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because of this, we have received the burden to start a Chinese-speaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Twenty-three years ago when I received the burden to come to the United States, I was very clear within that the Lord did not want me to work among the Chinese immigrants.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, He wanted me to bring His recovery to the typical Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, I concentrated my pioneering work among these Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord confirmed this and greatly blessed our work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Beginning in 1970, even though it became evident that we definitely needed a Chinese-speaking work, I still did not touch this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is because I knew that once I gave my attention to the Chinese-speaking work, the English-speaking work would suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Also, in principle, once the number of the Chinese increases in the meetings, more typical Americans are reluctant to come.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, it was not convenient for me to touch the Chinese-speaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way, we were not keen in our perception, and after six or seven years we lost from five hundred to one thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Later we began to have the Chinese-speaking meeting, and two years ago we began the Chinese-speaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Now the number of the Chinese saints has become stabilized, and new ones are gradually being gained.</S>
