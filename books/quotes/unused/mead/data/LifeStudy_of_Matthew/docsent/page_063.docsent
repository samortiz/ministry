   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Being the Light of the World 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a City upon a Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 14 says, You are the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Light is the shining of the lamp to enlighten those in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To the darkened world, the people of the kingdom of the heavens are such a light effacing its darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In nature they are the healing salt, and in behavior they are the shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the shining light, the kingdom people are like a city situated upon a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a city cannot be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is ultimately consummated in the holy city of the New Jerusalem Rev 21:10-11, 23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For many years I was troubled by the Lord s illustration of a city situated upon a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Until I came into the church life, I could not understand how light could be illustrated by a builded city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After I was in the practical building of the church, I saw that only by being built together can the kingdom people be a city situated on a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This city becomes a shining light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Anaheim the saints are grouping together in their neighborhoods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If this practice becomes prevailing and the saints in these groups are built together, every group will be part of the shining city situated on a mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In these three chapters the Lord Jesus did not use the term church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the term kingdom, used many times in these chapters, actually refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kingdom mentioned in Matthew 5, 6, and 7 is that aspect of the church concerned with discipline and exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is the aspect of grace and life for the kingdom, and the kingdom is the aspect of discipline and exercise for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the Lord s word in these chapters regarding the kingdom actually refers to the exercise and discipline in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we have seen, many Christians understand these chapters in an individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most have not seen that this constitution is not for individuals, but for a corporate people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know that this decree is for a corporate people, because the light is not an individual person, but a builded city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that the kingdom people need the building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the saints in the church in your locality are not built up, but are scattered, divided, and separated, there is no city there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And as long as there is no city, there is no light, because the light is the city; the light is not an individual believer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The light is a corporate city built up as one entity to shine over the people surrounding it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is impossible to find such a thing in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But every local church in the Lord s recovery must be a builded city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the book of Revelation the churches are golden lampstands Rev 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The principle of the city and the lampstand is the same: neither is individual.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both are corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The lampstand, like the city, is not an individual believer, but the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are outside the church, you are not a part of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to be part of the lampstand, you must be built into the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The local church, which is the lampstand, is likened by the Lord to a builded city set on the top of a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are built up in our locality, we shall be on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we are scattered, separated, and divided, we shall be in a low valley.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In every locality there must be just one lampstand, one city situated on a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this, we must keep the unity and remain one entity, a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we shall be able to shine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if we are divided, we are finished with the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no shining in Christianity today because it is so divided.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are many divisions in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Lord s recovery, however, we must come back to the unique unity, which is the corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we have truly been built together, we shall be the city on a mountaintop shining upon those around us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a Lamp on the Lampstand</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 15 says, Neither do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand, and it shines to all who are in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The shining of the light has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the first aspect, the light is likened to a city shining upon the outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the second aspect, the light is likened to a lamp on a lampstand shining to those who are in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have seen that the city is the builded church, but what is the house?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may think that the house here also refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, there is no need to interpret the house in this manner.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the context, the main point is that the shining of the light has two aspects: the outward aspect and the inward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The light as a city on a mountain shines over the outsiders, whereas the lighted lamp on the lampstand shines over those who are in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the city, the light shines upon people, but as the lamp in the house, the light shines into people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This indicates that our influence over others should not be just outward, but also inward.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to shine upon others outwardly, we need to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But to shine upon others inwardly, we need to be without any covering.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As the light on the mountain, the light cannot be hidden; and as the lamp on the lampstand, the light should not be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In verse 15 the Lord speaks about placing the lamp under the bushel.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A lighted lamp placed under the bushel cannot shine out its light.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The kingdom people as the lighted lamp should not be covered by the bushel, an item pertaining to eating, a matter which causes anxiety 6:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never be covered by the bushel; rather, we must be on the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord wisely spoke about not being covered by a bushel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In ancient times a bushel, as a measure for grain, was something related to eating and therefore related to the matter of making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, hiding the lamp under the bushel indicates anxiety concerning our living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we Christians are anxious about our living and concerned about how much money we are making, this anxiety will become a bushel covering our light.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The kingdom people firstly exercise an influence upon people outwardly, from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, we still need to influence them from within.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the church as a whole lives together as a city on the mountaintop, those surrounding it will be under the shining of such a builded church.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But this is merely the shining from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The church also needs to exert another kind of influence, the influence of the inner shining that gets into people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, the city on the mount signifies the shining from outside, and the lamp in the house signifies the shining from inside.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our shining must not be only outside the people, but also inside them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In order to shine upon others outwardly, we must be builded as a city on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But in order to shine upon them inwardly, we need to come out from under our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This indicates that the kingdom people live without anxiety and the care for their existence.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They care only for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Day after day they are the happy people, the praising people, the hallelujah people.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When our neighbors, relatives, and classmates contact us, they can sense that we have no anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We are not worried about our living, about what we shall eat or what we shall put on.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Day after day, morning and night, the kingdom people care only for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We know from experience that our lack of anxiety touches others.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If every time someone contacts you, you are happy and enjoying the Lord, he will be deeply touched.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Filled with anxiety and occupied with all kinds of worries, the worldly people talk about the fear of losing their job or the difficulties they are having with their boss.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But the kingdom people, the hallelujah people, those not covered by the bushel, care only to talk about Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>By being such a people, we touch the hearts of others and shine upon them from within.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This shining penetrates them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The outward shining of the kingdom people is general, and all of society can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Society can see a group of people who are built up, situated upon the top of a mountain, and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The inward shining, on the contrary, is particular.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>One of your cousins may be touched by your lack of anxiety and your shining face.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Whenever he contacts you, he never hears you talking about how to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Instead, he always hears you praising the Lord and telling how wonderful the church life is.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This will be a light penetrating into his being and shining within him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Through the shining of this light, he will be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is not the general shining from outside; it is the particular shining from within.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we are the proper kingdom people, we shall have this twofold shining.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We shall be a city on a mountaintop shining out upon all those surrounding us, and among them we shall be the hallelujah people, those with no anxiety or care about this life, shining into them.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This inward shining penetrates the inward being of others and convinces them.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Glorifying the Father in the Heavens</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Eventually, both aspects of our shining will give glory to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Verse 16 says, Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father Who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The title Father proves that the disciples, who were the new King s audience, were regenerated children of God John 1:12; Gal 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The good works here are the behavior of the kingdom people through which men may see God and be brought to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Our shining will glorify the Father because it expresses what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>To glorify God the Father is to give Him the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Glory is God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When the kingdom people express God in their behavior and good works, men see God and give the glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>God hidden is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But when God is expressed, that is the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If as the kingdom people we have such a shining light, God will be expressed in this shining, and all those around us will see the glory, God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When others see God in our shining, that is a glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We, the kingdom people, are the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>As light we are like a city on a mountaintop and like a lamp shining in a house.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>From without and within, we shine to express God, to let God have the glory in the eyes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>May we exercise such an influence upon those around us.</S>
