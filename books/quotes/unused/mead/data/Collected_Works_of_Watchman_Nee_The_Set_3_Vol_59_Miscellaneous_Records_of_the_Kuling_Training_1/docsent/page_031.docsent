   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESURRECTION The Need for Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was perfect in His character but not in His power.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our Lord was limited in power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the reason it was not enough for Him to live thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He needed to go through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is something beyond our mental power of comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers and sisters, this is a tremendous matter, but it is useless to try to fathom it with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without revelation, no one will be interested in this subject, just as a village simpleton has no interest whatsoever in the atomic bomb.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why did the Lord need resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was limited in time and space on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some who came and looked for Him had to remove a roof to reach Him Mark 2:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One had to press against the crowd to touch the hem of His garment 5:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The centurion was an exception; he had a faith that bypassed the pressing of the crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord commended his faith as being great.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His servant was ill, and he asked the Lord to say a word so that his servant would be healed Luke 7:6-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The centurion's word, in effect, acknowledged that the Lord was beyond time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His servant was immediately healed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here was a man who had revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord was conceived through the Holy Spirit Matt 1:20; Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As far as His character was concerned, He was the pinnacle of God's creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet as far as His power was concerned, He was still limited.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason there is the need of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Resurrection Securing for God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>the Representative Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let us consider the meaning of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Resurrection means that God has secured a representative man for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hebrews 1:5 says, "You are My Son; this day have I begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Acts 13:33, this verse refers to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Resurrection means that the model man Jesus is now no longer bound by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He lives now for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord's resurrection broke all the barriers of the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Peter 1:3 says that we are saved and regenerated through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was the possibility of the Lord's death when He lived on the earth, but after His resurrection, death was destroyed, and He lives forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The potential and the power of death were forever destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God worked on man for four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The man He sought after is finally here.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God declared to the Lord Jesus at His resurrection, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You" Acts 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not declare this in Bethlehem at the Lord's birth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was after the Lord's resurrection from the dead that God pronounced with joy, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through the Lord's resurrection God secured the man He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Resurrection Annulling</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>the Limitation of Time and Space</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is the meaning of resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It means that a man has broken through all barriers, even the greatest barrier of all death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All barriers were destroyed through the Lord Jesus in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Testament speaks a few times of the raising of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For example, there were the widow's son in Nain Luke 7:11-15 , the daughter of Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue Matt 9:18-25 , and Lazarus John 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, even the raising of Lazarus was merely a kind of coming back to life or resuscitation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was bound by grave clothes and would not have been able to walk if others had not loosed him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Eventually, Lazarus still died.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only the Lord's resurrection was a total destruction of death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When He resurrected, He faced death no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible shows us that only the Lord is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mr. T. Austin-Sparks said in reference to the Lord's resurrection that with Him there is no such thing as coming and going.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With Him there is only a matter of appearing and disappearing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He does not come; He appears.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He does not go; He disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is no longer a question of coming and going but of being visible or not visible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In John 20:16-17, on the morning of His resurrection, the Lord told Mary the Magdalene not to touch Him because He was not the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As for Thomas's touching His side, it was a matter of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He wanted Thomas to touch in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is possible to touch the resurrected Lord by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not a matter of coming and going with the resurrected Lord; it is altogether a matter of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Man's biggest limitations are time and space, but these two things cannot limit the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Resurrection means that all limitations have been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hallelujah, our Lord Jesus is no longer bound by anything today!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as we live in the Holy Spirit, we can touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord is in our midst, and all barriers are broken.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord journeyed from beyond the Jordan to Judea after Lazarus died.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When He arrived, Martha said, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord said, "Your brother will rise again."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She answered, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day" John 11:21-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord immediately replied, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live....Do you believe this?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In effect, the Lord was saying, "I am the last day!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you believe into Me, you will see resurrection now.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Wherever I am, time no longer exists, and the last day' no longer exists."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As soon as resurrection comes in, the element of time is over.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If resurrection is absent, time is a big factor, but wherever resurrection is, time is no longer an issue because resurrection is not bound by time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Moreover, resurrection is not bound by space either.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The two disciples on the way to Emmaus saw the resurrected Lord, but the disciples in Jerusalem also saw Him on the same day Luke 24:13-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When the Son of God resurrected, He transcended geography and time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In His resurrection there is no such thing as a sequence of time.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He does not have a time schedule for His work.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He does not have to wait three or five years for something to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The matter of time and space no longer exists.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Today everyone on the whole earth can touch Him at the same time.</S>
