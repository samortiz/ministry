   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. In Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 5 says that the mystery has been revealed to the apostles and prophets in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word spirit here refers to the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It can be considered the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such a mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation concerning Christ and the church is unveiled to the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need the same spirit to see such a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we speak to others about Christ and the church, we should not speak from our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, from our spirit we should tell others what we have experienced of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The principle here is that emotion touches emotion, mind touches mind, and will touches will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, only spirit can contact spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you speak to others from your emotion, you will not be able to touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if you speak out from your spirit, their spirit will be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Concerning Christ and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The revelation received by the apostles and prophets is not a revelation of the many secondary matters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the revelation concerning Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to dispense Christ to others, we need to have this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 3:4 Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 Gk. is Christ, whereas the mystery of Christ here is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A. Hidden in Other Generations</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>but Revealed in the New Testament Age</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This mystery was hidden in other generations, but has been revealed in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The mystery of Christ, the church, which is His Body, was hidden in the Old Testament ages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>None of the Old Testament saints knew anything regarding this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But it is revealed in the New Testament to all believers through the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today our ministry is simply to carry on this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>B. The Church, the Body of Christ 1.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the Nations as Joint-heirs</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>and Joint-partakers of the Promise</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have pointed out that the mystery of Christ is the church, which is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regarding the church as the mystery of Christ, verse 6 says that the nations are to be joint-heirs and a joint Body and joint-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The term joint-heirs indicates that in God s New Testament economy, the nations, the chosen and redeemed Gentiles, are joined with the believing Jews to be the heirs of God, inheriting God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The term joint Body indicates that the saved Gentiles are joined with the saved Jews to be the one Body of Christ for His unique expression.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The term joint-partakers indicates that the Gentile believers are joined with the Jewish believers to partake of God s promises given in the Old Testament concerning all the blessings of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Joint-heirs are related to the blessing of the household of God; a joint Body is related to the blessing of the Body of Christ; and the joint-partakers are related to the blessing of the promises of God, as found in Genesis 3:15; 12:3; 22:18; 28:14; and Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both the blessing of God s household and the blessing of Christ s Body are particular, whereas the blessing of God s promise is general, all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brought Forth out of</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church as the Body of Christ is brought forth out of the unsearchable riches of Christ 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is not brought forth out of doctrines or systems of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the Body of Christ, the church can only be brought forth out of the riches of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For Expressing</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>to the Rulers and Authorities in the Heavenlies</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to God s intention, the church is to express His multifarious wisdom to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is to shame Satan and his followers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Satan s plots afford God the opportunity to express His wisdom in a multifarious way through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the Eternal Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Which God Made in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The producing of the church to be the Body of Christ is according to the eternal purpose which God made in Christ in eternity past 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The formation of the church is not accidental, but eternally planned.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For the Dispensation of God</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God s purpose in having the church is to dispense Himself into His chosen people 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, the church as the Body of Christ is the dispensation of God.</S>
