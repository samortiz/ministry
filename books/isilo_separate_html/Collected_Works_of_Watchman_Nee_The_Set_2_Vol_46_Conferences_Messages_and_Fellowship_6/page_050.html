Therefore, in this place there must be only one church. Yet how can everyone in this place be truly one when their experiences, views, and doctrines differ so much? One believes in baptism by immersion, another in baptism by sprinkling; one believes in the pre-tribulation rapture, another in the post-tribulation rapture. There are many different beliefs among the local Christians, and these different beliefs lead to different practices. The human mind seeks to solve the problem by insisting on unity of action. We want everyone else to conform to our mode of thinking and acting. We believe that we have the guidance of the Lord, but we refuse to allow others to have His guidance too. We trust the working of the Spirit in our own hearts, but we do not trust the working of the Spirit in the hearts of others. This was not Paul's attitude, as revealed in Romans 14:1&mdash;15:7, which deals with a very important principle in regard to the church life.</p><p>Two difficulties had arisen in the church in Rome&mdash;vegetarianism and Sabbatarianism. The vegetarians maintained that men began to eat meat only after the fall, and for that reason the eating of meat was wrong. There is no harm in ruling meat out from one's diet, but there is no salvation in it either. Vegetarianism is Cainism; it is bloodless. The Lord said, "My flesh is true food (i.e., eatable), and My blood is true drink (i.e., drinkable)" (John 6:55). If we do not eat "meat," we cannot be saved. Vegetarianism suggests that man has no sin. Adam's food in the garden was herbs, but no sin was present. When sin came in, God altered man's food. There is the need of atonement; therefore, the blood must be shed. There is need of strength from God; therefore, the flesh must be eaten.</p><p>Considering the implications of vegetarianism, Paul might well have argued that these vegetarians were not Christians. He might have argued just as clearly that the Sabbatarians were not Christians. What would we have done in the face of such conditions? What assembly today would allow some of its members to keep the Sabbath, others to keep the Lord's Day, others to keep both days, and still others to keep no special day at all? What did Paul do? Did he try to bring them all into conformity of action? No! He did not say that the members who disallowed the eating of meat were strong Christians; he confessed that they were weak, but he also said they should be received. They were weak, and their weakness should be taken into account by the stronger members, who must discuss nothing with them but fundamental matters (14:1). Provided that a man is "in faith," we should certainly "receive" him, "but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his considerations."</p><p>Furthermore, we must not despise him (v. 3). We may naturally think, "Oh, what a weak Christian he is! He is a vegetarian! He is just like a Buddhist!" But such an attitude is all wrong. We may regard the man as weak and call him carnal, but if we think that we are strong, are we not also carnal? If we despise others, it is certain that we think too much of ourselves. It is easy for the vegetarian to say, "Oh, these people are given over to worldly lusts, they are `gluttonous' and `drunkard[s]' (Matt. 11:19). We are more spiritual than they because our bodies are kept under control." How easy it is to condemn one another! Therefore, Paul exhorts each party to refrain from judging the other because "God has received him" (Rom. 14:3). We have fellowship with others on this basis alone: that they have fellowship with God. If God has received anyone, then we receive him as well. If any Christian comes into our assembly, the question is not whether he believes exactly what we believe or has the same experiences, but this: Has God received him? If God has received him, then he belongs to the same church as we do.</p><p>Paul does not say that vegetarianism is right. He does not deal with the question of right or wrong but with the question of Christian fellowship. He makes clear what the basis of this fellowship is. The point to be stressed is not whether a man's views are right or wrong, but whether God has received him. If I meet a Roman Catholic, I do not ask whether he is he right or wrong but whether or not God has received him. If God has received him, then I recognize him as my brother. If I meet a Seventh-day Adventist, I can only ask whether or not God has received him. If God has received Him, then I must receive him as well. My receiving of him does not mean that he is right, but it does mean that he has a vital relationship with God. In matters of right or wrong we should seek to deal with our fellow believers in love. But we must first receive them without raising any points of controversy because this is distinctly forbidden in the Word of God.</p><p>Unfortunately, when Christians meet they generally discuss the points on which they disagree. There are numbers of things we have in common, but instead of meeting on positive ground, we often get on negative ground and discuss our differences. Carnal means can never bring about spiritual ends, and reasoning is carnal. We should love our brothers and pray for them, and if God gives opportunity, we can speak a word to them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
