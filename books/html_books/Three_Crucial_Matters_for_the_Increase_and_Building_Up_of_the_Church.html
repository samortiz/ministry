 <h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
 <p>This book is composed of messages on the practice of the God-ordained way given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei between 1986 and 1989. Chapters 1 through 7 were given in1986, chapters 8 through 16 in 1987, chapters 17 and 18 in 1988, and chapters 19 through 22 were given in 1989 to the saints who were involved in the spread of the gospel in Taiwan. These messages were translated from the original Chinese.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THREE CRUCIAL MATTERS<br />
FOR THE INCREASE AND BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
BEGETTING, NOURISHING, AND TEACHING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:2, 15; Heb. 10:25</h1>
<p>Since October 1984 I have returned to Taiwan many times, but instead of my burden decreasing, it has increased with each visit. I am filled with hope for Taiwan, and I have faith that the &ldquo;gospelizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;truthizing&rdquo; of Taiwan is not a dream. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be successful in Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING PEOPLE TO JOIN THE LORD&rsquo;S ARMY</h2>
<p>Many brothers and sisters are willing to offer themselves for the present move in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They are joining the Lord&rsquo;s army; they are enrolled in &ldquo;Calvary&rsquo;s hosts&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #473). This work is not what is commonly called a revival work in Christianity. The Lord is calling us to enroll in Calvary&rsquo;s hosts, that is, to give everything for His recovery. We must spend our time, strength, and money, and we must give our spirit, soul, and body, our entire being.</p>
<p>The most important thing in an army is the morale of the troops. The highest demand with regard to the morale is that the soldiers have no opinions. Everyone in an army must put aside his individual thoughts and views and have one heart and one mind. Then they can be in oneness without any differing opinions or goals.</p>
<p>In the past we stressed the truth that the ministry is for the churches but that the churches are not for the ministry. However, the churches need to be in one accord with the ministry. If the churches are not in one accord with the ministry, the ministry has no way to build up the churches or to fight for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. When we say that the ministry is for the churches, we mean that the ministry builds up the churches; the ministry does not build up itself. When we say that the churches are not for the ministry, we mean that the churches are not for the building up of the ministry. However, this does not mean that the churches should not be in one accord with the ministry.</p>
<p>For example, every country needs an army, but the army is not for itself; the army is for the country. However, the country must supply and support the army. Whoever is of military age in a country should fulfill his military service and be in one accord with the army. Then the army will be able to fight for the country. In addition, every citizen must be in one accord with the army and support it even if he cannot join the army. In this way all the citizens can be for the army. In the same way the churches must be in one accord with the ministry, supporting the ministry and being for the ministry.</p>
<p>We are not calling the entire church to join the army. This is a call for a group of brothers and sisters to fight for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The result of their fighting is for the churches, not the ministry. Whatever the ministry does is for the churches. The ministry builds up the churches in every locality. Today the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has more than six hundred churches all over the earth, and they are all supplied by the ministry.</p>
<p>I came to Taiwan in 1984 to establish a model for the building up and spread of the church. The brothers in America learned about this and wanted to copy what we were doing. I told them that copying is useless and that being in one accord is the most important matter. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He fed more than five thousand people and helped thousands of people. But after His resurrection He appeared only to over five hundred brothers (1 Cor. 15:5-8). In Acts 1 there were one hundred twenty people praying in the upper room. These ones were in the Lord&rsquo;s army. They were not afraid of the threats from the Jewish leaders, and they prayed in one accord for the Lord&rsquo;s move. They did not have any opinions; they simply prayed in one accord for ten days. Previously they had differing opinions and argued (Mark 9:34), but in Acts 1, Peter and the sons of thunder, James and John, no longer contended. They prayed earnestly in one accord to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ELIMINATING CONTROL AND<br />
THE FREEDOM TO DO WHAT ONE PLEASES</h2>
<p>In the degradation of the church the Roman Catholic Church formed a huge religious organization in which the pope occupies the top position and controls everything. Later Martin Luther brought in the Reformation. This promoted an atmosphere of freedom, but it also created a scattered and divided situation. Christianity is still filled with this atmosphere. Christians say that they do not accept human control and justify this by saying that they are following the Holy Spirit. Everyone supposedly follows the leading of the Holy Spirit, but the result is that every person has a different leading. This situation can be compared to the situation in Israel during the age of the judges; everyone did what was right in his own eyes because they did not have a king (Judg. 21:25).</p>
<p>Since the time that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was raised up, we have rejected control because it is not found in the Bible. The first twelve chapters of Acts show that Peter took the lead during the first stage of the church. During the second stage of the church, Acts 13 through 28, Paul took the lead. Even though Peter and Paul did not control anything, Timothy and Titus, Paul&rsquo;s co-workers, did not have the so-called freedom to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. When Paul exhorted Timothy &ldquo;to remain in Ephesus,&rdquo; Timothy remained in Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:3). When Paul said to Titus, &ldquo;Be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis,&rdquo; Titus came to Nicopolis (Titus 3:12). This is not the situation today; instead, people say, &ldquo;Even though you want me to go, I must pray to see how the Holy Spirit leads me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First Corinthians 16:12 is a special case. In this verse Paul says, &ldquo;Concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.&rdquo; Paul fervently hoped that Apollos would go and help the Corinthians resolve their problems, but Apollos said that he did not desire to go at that time. This was Apollos&rsquo;s opinion. Timothy and Titus, however, were in one accord with Paul and did not do things in this way. Apollos was also a co-worker, but he was not one with Paul; he had his own views and feelings. This shows that the situation in the early church was not clear. Acts 18:24 clearly says that Apollos was an eloquent man and that he was powerful in the Scriptures. First Corinthians 3:6 says that Paul planted and Apollos watered. This one who could expound the Scriptures and teach others did not follow the Spirit to be one with the leading co-worker. This caused some believers in the church in Corinth to say that they were of Paul and others to say that they were of Apollos (v. 4).</p>
<p>We must be one of Gideon&rsquo;s three hundred skilled warriors. We must not say Amen when things are peaceful but when the battle begins, say that we need to reconsider because it is not convenient. When we were in mainland China, many people said, &ldquo;Brother Nee, we want to follow your leading.&rdquo; They read all the books published by Brother Nee, but when they gave messages, they spoke their own words. They did not pay any attention to what Brother Nee spoke. Brother Nee could not do anything about this. If we want to succeed in the work, we must be in one accord.</p>
<p>Paul had a group of co-workers who walked and moved in the same step with him. They were in one soul, not merely in one spirit (2 Cor. 12:18; Phil. 1:27). In Romans Paul says that the believers should glorify God with one accord with one mouth (15:6). In 1 Corinthians he beseeches the brothers to &ldquo;speak the same thing&rdquo; (1:10). This means that if the believers could not speak the same thing, it was best for them not to speak. In Ephesians 4:3 Paul, speaking of the oneness in reality, exhorts the Ephesian believers to be &ldquo;diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.&rdquo; In Romans, 1 Corinthians, and Philippians Paul speaks of the practical one accord.</p>
<p>Being one in heart and in soul, thinking the same thing, and speaking the same thing are the foundation for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Many Christians hope to obtain the outpouring, the baptism, of the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit is never poured out upon individual members. The Holy Spirit is poured out upon the Body of Christ so that the Lord can obtain an army to fight for Him. The one hundred twenty believers in Jerusalem were in one accord, continuing steadfastly in prayer (Acts 1:14), and the result was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL THE LORD&rsquo;S LOVERS BEING FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>Every lover of the Lord should be a full-time serving one. Some drop their jobs to serve full time, and others serve full time while keeping their jobs. Some people are able to make money, but they are unable to expound the Bible. If we ask them to speak a few words for the Lord, they are unable to speak a clear word. Other people are the opposite; they are unable to make money. Therefore, those who are able to make money should make money for the Lord, and those who can expound the Bible and who have a gift to speak and teach should drop their jobs and serve full time.</p>
<p>Gospelizing Taiwan in five years is not an empty dream. If we produce five hundred full-timers every year, we will have two thousand five hundred full-timers in five years. These two thousand five hundred full-time serving ones will need more than two thousand five hundred money-making full-timers to support them. Even though God is omnipotent, He still needs man&rsquo;s cooperation. A money-making full-timer should subtract from his earnings whatever amount his family needs to live on and place the remaining amount on the altar for the Lord&rsquo;s use. If he does not practice this, he is not a full-timer. We are the true Israelites. When the Israelites were leaving Egypt, God told them to plunder the riches of Egypt (Exo. 3:22; 12:35-36). If our heart is for the Lord, He will certainly bless us. We should fear being enticed by money so that we are unwilling to give to the Lord. If five thousand people in Taiwan are willing to live a life of giving their all to the Lord, it will certainly be possible to gospelize and truthize Taiwan.</p>
<p>When I gave up my job to serve the Lord full time in 1933, there were only two or three thousand people in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. These believers gave their all. In order to save money for the Lord&rsquo;s use, some people would walk instead of taking the electric tram. We were supported by what the believers gave. Sometimes we would receive a gift of one dollar when it seemed that we were about to eat our last meal. The environment in Taiwan today is rich; if we are willing to give everything to the Lord, He will have a way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEED BEING TO GO FORTH TO SPEAK THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>The educational standard in Taiwan has been raised because education is compulsory for everyone. This has given every person, regardless of his occupation, a desire to learn the true meaning of human life. Christianity has lost the truth and has fallen into methods, traditions, superstitions, and shallowness. Most people are tired of hearing the simple and shallow teachings about going to heaven or hell. They want to hear the truth concerning the meaning of human life. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has the truth, but we need people to go out to dispense the truth.</p>
<p>We are happy that many of the young brothers and sisters pray using terms such as <em>God&rsquo;s dispensing, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy,</em> and <em>divine transformation.</em> Even the older saints in their fifties and sixties can pray with these terms. We are also encouraged that the saints do not sing common hymns. The labor of the ministry has not been in vain because a number of spiritual things have entered into the saints. The believers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not the only ones who need the truth. The believers in Christianity and the unbelievers need the truth. First Timothy 2:4 says that God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; How will all men come to the full knowledge of the truth if we do not go forth to speak? Therefore, we must see that our commission is to send forth the gospel and the truth as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING<br />
TO BEGET, NOURISH, AND TEACH</h2>
<p>There are three important matters for the spread and increase of the church, namely, begetting, nourishing, and teaching. Every country is founded upon its society, and the soundness of a society depends upon begetting, nourishing, and teaching. The church, as a heavenly society, also needs begetting, nourishing, and teaching. The church begets by preaching the gospel. We need a plan to preach the gospel in every school, in every home of every neighborhood, to every level of society, and in every village. After gaining people, we need to nourish them. In society nourishing takes place in the homes; in the church nourishing should take place in the home meetings. I hope that there will be a home meeting in the home of every brother and sister. If there are two thousand family units in Taipei, there should be two thousand home meetings. Every home should be for begetting and nourishing.</p>
<p>Taiwan places much emphasis on education, and everyone admires this. Some people in America showed me a cartoon in which a Chinese boy was studying while his mother was preparing a meal for him, his father was fanning him, and his younger brother was massaging his back. The entire family was helping him to study. Some Americans say that education is the current Chinese idol. Parents in Taiwan economize on their food and clothing in order to save money to educate their children.</p>
<p>In the church life we have <em>Truth Lessons</em> for our education. We need a change in our concept to emphasize truth education in the church. According to our old system there were four kinds of meetings. There was the big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day that attracted people with messages. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day people asked who was giving the message that day. They loved to listen to the brothers who spoke eloquently. There was the meeting for preaching the gospel, which was held whenever there was a need to preach the gospel. There was the bread-breaking meeting to remember the Lord, and there was the prayer meeting. We had these four kinds of meetings every week of every year, but we did not beget or nourish many people, and we did not have sufficient education.</p>
<p>When the work began in Taipei more than thirty years ago, as soon as a person was saved, he was placed in a home meeting. We also had three or four months of training every year. But when I returned in 1984, there were only these four kinds of meetings. There was a lack of teaching the truth for education and a lack of nourishing in the home meetings. For this reason, my burden is to hold a training to train full-timers, elders, and co-workers to do three things: preach the gospel, build up the home meetings, and teach the truth. This is to beget, nourish, and teach.</p>
<p>If we do not intensify our effort in these three things&mdash;preaching the gospel, building up home meetings, and teaching the truth&mdash;the church will not be strong. Some people say that the home meetings will not work. Of course, if we do not go and practice, they will never work. Whether or not something works depends on our willingness to practice. For example, the freeways in Taiwan are flat roads, but when they were being built, many obstacles needed to be overcome. The people who built the freeways needed to cut through mountains and build bridges over rivers. If we want the church to be strong and the Lord&rsquo;s work to spread, we need a group of laboring ones to rise up to preach the gospel, build up home meetings, and teach the brothers and sisters how to learn the truth.</p>
<p>One brother invited a couple to attend a home meeting. In the home meeting they read portions from <em>The Living Needed for Building Up the Small Group Meetings.</em> The husband prayed to receive the Lord, and a brother baptized him in the bathtub. While the husband was being baptized, the sisters preached the gospel to his wife, and she also was baptized. This newly baptized couple came to the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. This is the function of the home meetings. If the church in Taipei has four hundred home meetings functioning in this way, there will certainly be the increase. A person who believes and is baptized as a result of attending a meeting in a believer&rsquo;s home will remember this experience for his entire life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must emphasize <em>Truth Lessons.</em> There is a locality near Taipei that holds two classes for <em>Truth Lessons</em> at four different times on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In one day they have eight classes in which they perfect the saints to teach the truth. All teachers know that teaching a matter, rather than simply studying it, is the best way to gain a thorough understanding. If we study something by ourselves, we can be careless in our understanding, but when we teach others, we are forced to understand the material thoroughly. <em>Truth Lessons</em> should be studied in a group. This method of teaching will enable us to enter into the truth.</p>
<p>Some people say that <em>Truth Lessons</em> are too deep and difficult to understand. If a person reads a lesson several times, he will spontaneously understand it. When I was young, I read the statement &ldquo;The way of great learning depends on developing the bright virtue,&rdquo; and of course, I did not understand it. However, I later understood it. We should never demean the truth. The elderly brothers and sisters are able to understand matters such as the divine dispensing, transformation, conformation, and the essential and economical Spirit. In the same principle, when we preach the gospel, we should not speak a shallow word because we fear that people will not understand us otherwise. We must speak the excellent truths in the Bible. If people do not understand the truth today, they will understand after they hear the truth over a period of time. Our responsibility is to preach until every home knows the truth. Then everyone will know the truth and every family will speak the truth.</p>
<p>May all the churches in Taiwan practice begetting, nourishing, and teaching for the increase and building up of the church. To practice these three things is to preach the gospel, to build up the home meetings, and to teach the truth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOME MEETINGS AND <em>TRUTH LESSONS</em></h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:25; 2 Tim. 2:2, 15</h1>
<p>After we join the Lord&rsquo;s army, we must know how to serve in order to be for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. We must not forget the three crucial matters for the increase and building up of the church, namely, begetting, nourishing, and teaching. The gospel is for begetting, the home meetings are for nourishing, and <em>Truth Lessons</em> is for teaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Last year the church in Taipei was successful in spreading the gospel. However, we must improve, just as the methods of transportation are constantly being improved. There was a time when ox carts were used for transportation. Now we have jumbo jets that can fly directly from Los Angeles to Taipei in only thirteen hours. Moreover, a person flying in an airplane can move around freely because airplanes are very stable. This is an improvement in transportation. Likewise, we should not cling to and continue to meet in our old ways.</p>
<p>In the past we had only four kinds of meetings. There was the big meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning that was mainly for listening to &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speakers. When a &ldquo;well-known&rdquo; brother spoke, more people attended the meeting. The next kind of meeting was the gospel meeting. The third kind of meeting was the table meeting to remember the Lord. The fourth kind of meeting was the prayer meeting. The church, however, is a home, and homes are for begetting and nourishing. These four kinds of meetings are not related to the functions of begetting and nourishing in a home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUTURE OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING ON<br />
BEGETTING, NOURISHING, AND TEACHING</h2>
<p>Even though we did not preach the gospel much in the past, some people were saved, but not many of them remained in the church. When I left Taipei in 1961, there were more than twenty thousand people in our records. When I returned in 1984, there were only eleven thousand people in our records. The church baptized many people during the past twenty-three years, but when we subtract the number of saints who moved abroad, those who went to be with the Lord, those who became cold and backslidden, and those with whom we lost contact, we find that our numbers have decreased, not increased. This is because the church lacks nourishing. It is easy for a mother to give birth to a child, but it is not so easy for her to nourish that child. In nourishing the child, a mother needs to feed it, change its diaper at night, and even endure its crying. Without nourishing, however, the child will not grow up to become a healthy member of society.</p>
<p>When we preach the gospel, we beget many children, but if we do not nourish and teach them, they will not be useful. In Taiwan today every family pays much attention to raising and educating their children; they even give their children a high level of education. It is no wonder that Taiwan is improving. The church is not a society, but it is a corporate group. If we desire those who are gained through our preaching of the gospel to remain in the church, we must nourish and teach them. Many brothers and sisters have been saved for many years and have listened to messages week after week, but they cannot clearly explain the basic truths, such as justification by faith, sanctification, and redemption. However, some of the young brothers and sisters can explain these truths. This shows that there is potential with the young people.</p>
<p>There is an enormous need today. Those who are able to speak many languages can travel all over the world to preach the gospel and expound the truth in every place. Brother John Nelson Darby is a good example. He was fluent in five languages&mdash;English, French, German, Greek, and Hebrew. Therefore, the Lord was able to use him to translate the entire Bible into English, French, and German.</p>
<p>A normal church must have begetting, nourishing, and teaching. A church that can only beget but cannot nourish or teach has no future. We should not look to our past success or simply give messages on being spiritual, loving the Lord, bearing the cross, and resurrection. We have been preaching these things for more than ten years, but the brothers and sisters are still not sufficiently nourished or educated. Whenever the church lacks nourishing and teaching, it has no way to spread.</p>
<p>Our goals today are spreading the gospel, building up home meetings, and teaching the truth with <em>Truth Lessons.</em> In other words, our goals are begetting, nourishing, and teaching. We need to speak this to the saints until they are impressed. The elders, co-workers, and full-timers need to learn how to speak these three goals in a clear and strong way.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR LACK IN THE PAST</h2>
<p>We cannot deny that out of thousands of Christians the Lord has blessed us with a thorough knowledge of salvation and a clear understanding of the truth. People praise us because our exposition of the Bible has influenced Christians in the Far East for the past forty years. This means that Christianity in the Far East openly admits that we have influenced their knowledge and exposition of the Bible. We have received the Lord&rsquo;s particular blessing. We love the Lord, and we know the truth, but we must not stop here. We should spread the gospel to every part of Taiwan, and we should release the truth.</p>
<p>In the past Western missionaries came from Europe and America to preach the gospel in the provinces of interior China. Even though the economy in Taiwan is developed, education is available, and transportation is convenient, we still have not spread the gospel to every part of this island. We have wasted the Lord&rsquo;s grace, especially during the past twenty years when very few full-timers were produced. If we had produced two full-timers every year for twenty years, we would have forty full-timers. There are approximately twenty thousand saints in Taiwan, but we have produced an insignificant number of full-timers. In addition, an insufficient number of people go out to preach the gospel. We are indebted to the Lord.</p>
<p>There are more than six hundred churches around the globe, and three hundred of them were raised up in the last twenty-three years, after I went to America. The Lord is spreading in the West, but His spread in Taiwan is very weak. The world today has become smaller; hence, if the Lord is unable to spread in Taiwan, eventually the churches in America will be affected. This is the reason I felt to return to Taiwan in order to change things at the &ldquo;roots.&rdquo; We must wake up. If we continue to ignore the Lord&rsquo;s leading and teaching, sooner or later we will force Him to raise up another group of people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE BEING FULL TIME<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Many among us came from mainland China and have experienced the sweetness and the bitterness of human life. I was born into a poor family, and over the past eighty years I have seen everything there is in human life. According to my experience of human life, last year I wrote a hymn in Chinese that says, &ldquo;The human life without Christ / Is all vain and all empty; / A meaningless human life / Without hope and without goal&rdquo; (Appendix #4, stanza 4). Stanza 5 shows the change that occurs in a person&rsquo;s human life when he has Christ: &ldquo;When we receive Christ as life, / In our spirit we&rsquo;re reborn; / We live by Him every moment, / And our life is turned to song.&rdquo; As believers who thank the Lord for His salvation and want to live by Him, we should not think that we must drop our jobs in order to serve Him full time. The sisters who are at home raising their children and caring for their husbands can be full-timers. A brother making money at a job can also be full time for the Lord. Everything depends on our heart. If our heart is toward the Lord, we are full-timers.</p>
<p>It is difficult to set a standard for human life. No matter how many items of clothing a person has, he has only one body, and no matter how much he eats, he has only one stomach. All the good food in the world cannot fit in his stomach. Therefore, we should not consider how much money we can make in order to raise our standard of living. Extravagant living causes us to be overweight. This is a slow kind of suicide. If our house is too large, we are unable to clean it by ourselves, and we need someone to help us. It is better to have a smaller house that we can clean by ourselves. There are presently more than twenty thousand brothers and sisters in Taiwan. If every household slightly decreases its living expenditures by one dollar a day, on the average every brother and sister would save three hundred sixty dollars a year. In one year we would save a total of $7.2 million. This money could be used for the spread of the church.</p>
<p>The saints may not know the great financial need that there is overseas. During the last three months we received a letter in America from a brother who is a pastor in Guatemala. In the letter he said that he became clear about the truth by reading our publications. He is planning to hold trainings in seventeen places this year to train approximately eight hundred to one thousand pastors, and he asked us to send brothers to help with the trainings. Two co-workers went there and telephoned us to say that the situation is very good. The work in Guatemala is proceeding in different provinces, and they desperately need books in Spanish. We sent them video players and videotapes of the ministry because we do not have many books in Spanish. The two brothers who went spent one week in Guatemala and then went to Colombia and Costa Rica.</p>
<p>America is not the only continent with this situation. Europe has a similar situation. The recovery has spread to Finland, which can be called the neighbor of the Soviet Union. There is also a great need in Africa. A few days ago the Living Stream Ministry office called me to say that they sent a container of books to Accra, the capital of Ghana in Africa. They sent one thousand copies of the New Testament Recovery Version in English, worth approximately fifty thousand to sixty thousand dollars. Most of these books were sent free of charge.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE BEARING THE BURDEN<br />
FOR THE ADVANCE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery overseas began from Taiwan. When I brought my family of twelve to Taiwan, I only had three hundred dollars, which was enough to support us for only three months. Since then the Lord has blessed us, and we cannot forget His grace. We need to spread the gospel and not keep our money in our hands. It does not matter whether our homes are large or small. It would be wonderful if by reducing the size of his home, a person could offer one thousand five hundred dollars for the spread of the gospel and the support of full-timers. If five souls can be saved through this offering, it is worthwhile. In Luke 16:9 the Lord said, &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.&rdquo; The Lord is keeping an account for us in the heavens. When we enter into the eternal tabernacles, the people who are saved through our giving will greet us. This is what the Lord Himself taught.</p>
<p>First Timothy 6:8 says, &ldquo;Having food and covering, with these we will be content.&rdquo; Many brothers and sisters, however, earn three or four times more than what they need for food and covering. What is the purpose of keeping the extra money? We do not want the full-timers to experience a lack in their living, nor do we agree that the saints should continue increasing their standard of living without restriction. The saints are wasting money on food, drink, and clothing. If everyone saved one dollar for the Lord every day, in one month they would have thirty dollars, and in one year, three hundred sixty dollars. We are fellowshipping these things so that our fellowship concerning gospelizing Taiwan and begetting, nourishing, and teaching would not be empty words. Begetting new ones costs money. The new ones need to be nourished, and nourishing also costs money. Teaching is even more expensive. The emphasis of our burden is not the full-timers going out to spread the gospel but every brother and sister bearing the burden to gospelize Taiwan.</p>
<p>We have four directions in the gospel: the campuses, the neighborhoods, every level of society, and every town and village. We may not be able to go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel, but we cannot say that we do not have neighbors. Most people today live in high-rise apartments and have neighbors who live above, below, to the left, and to the right of them; hence, it is easy to preach the gospel to people. But since our concept and our taste have not changed, we still emphasize the big meetings. We must understand that the big meetings are for the occasional worshippers who have not been completely gained by the Lord. We should continue the big meetings for such people. These meetings are not for us. We should each have a home meeting in our home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREPARING APPROPRIATE MATERIAL<br />
FOR THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>I believe that we have all tasted the benefits of the home meetings that cannot be found in the big meetings. After seven or eight people meet together three to five times in a home meeting, the saints will know each other. They will then be able to help each other. This is a strong point of the home meetings. There are no famous people giving messages in the home meetings, and the co-workers or elders do not need to prepare a long message. Every meeting needs only a short portion of the ministry as the material for the home meeting. For example, the book <em>The Living Needed for Building Up the Small Group Meetings</em> is very good material. The first chapter speaks of &ldquo;A Living That Is out of the Holy Spirit and through the Human Spirit.&rdquo; The elders can choose four or five pages as the content for the home meetings and ask the brothers and sisters to read the material on their own before the meeting. They can then read it together in the meeting. The saints do not come to the home meetings to listen to a message; they come to read a message together. When we read, we should not be formal. We must all exercise our spirit. Then we will absorb all the nutrients in the message.</p>
<p>The elders and co-workers in the localities cannot merely speak about the home meetings without giving the saints material to read in the meeting. In a meeting hall of three hundred people two or three full-time brothers can spend time to pray and seek the Lord in order to prepare material for the home meetings. We have many books that can be used. Inviting a famous person to speak does not necessarily make the meetings richer or more enlightening than reading material from our publications. Why should we give up the supply that we have? Why do we not use the material that is already prepared? Our problem is that the brothers and sisters are used to the big meetings, not the home meetings, and the elders and co-workers are not used to leading the home meetings. The best material for the home meetings is the Life-studies. The elders and co-workers must learn how to prepare simple, home-cooked, healthy meals for the home meetings, not big feasts. If we can prepare material for three hundred sixty-five days and distribute it to the saints, they will have nourishing food to eat when they gather in their meetings. The result will be that everyone will have a good appetite, and they will be nourished.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEETINGS NEEDING TO NOURISH AND TEACH</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s table meetings should not be longer than one hour. The remaining half hour can be used to read a life-nourishing message. According to my observation, even though we spend the time after remembering the Lord to share our testimonies, there is not much enjoyment. Many people do not speak in the meetings because they are afraid that if they speak, they will expose their condition. This gives those who do not care about being exposed the opportunity to speak in every meeting. However, their speaking is not short; they speak for a long time and ruin everyone&rsquo;s appetite for the meeting. The responsible brothers are afraid of offending those who speak long and do not say anything to them; thus, everyone must endure their speaking. From now on, after breaking bread, those who have something of content should share it. After their sharing, we will read a life-nourishing message together. No one should speak carelessly on matters that are unrelated to the topic of the message. We must ensure that every time the brothers and sisters come to the meeting, they enjoy fellowship with the Lord and are supplied with life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must encourage the brothers and sisters to attend the prayer meetings. After the prayer meetings we can spend half an hour to fellowship about the spiritual principles of serving, how to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading, how to serve people, or how to take care of the meetings. There will then be three meetings every week in which we read messages&mdash;home meetings, bread-breaking meetings, and prayer meetings. In one year we will read more than one hundred fifty messages. In this way we will have nourishing and teaching. We must not emphasize the big meetings any longer. On the contrary, we must emphasize the home meetings. Then the function of the home meetings will be manifested, and people will be successfully brought to salvation, cared for, and supported. Furthermore, on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning we should go over <em>Truth Lessons</em> in separate classes. The classes can be divided according to the level of the spiritual education of the saints. In this way, every person in this large family will be healthy and strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING THE FUNCTION OF THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Preaching the gospel in the home meetings is very powerful. There are more than four hundred home meetings in Taipei. If each home meeting brings one person to salvation every week, one thousand six hundred people will be saved in one month, and approximately twenty thousand will be saved in one year. Since those saved in the home meetings are the relatives, friends, neighbors, or classmates of the brothers and sisters, they will be stable, and it will be easy for them to remain.</p>
<p>We have information cards for more than eleven thousand people, but only about four thousand people meet regularly. We need to visit and take care of the remaining six or seven thousand people. We can assign them to the saints based on where they live. The saints can then invite them for a meal, fellowship with them, and bring them to the home meetings. We cannot rely merely on the elders to do this. We should rely on the home meetings to carry this out if we want to be successful.</p>
<p>For the future of the church and for our spiritual growth and function before the Lord, we need to receive this burden. When the Lord returns, we will settle accounts with Him. This is not a small thing. We cannot treasure only John 3:16, which says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.&rdquo; We must also remember Matthew 25:19, which says, &ldquo;After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.&rdquo; When the Lord returns, the good and faithful slaves will be rewarded, but the evil and slothful slaves will be punished. Even if the Lord tarries, who among us dares to say that he will still be alive tomorrow? Before we go to see the Lord, we must seize the opportunity to love Him, serve Him, please Him, and be ready to settle accounts with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE LEARNING TO BE<br />
A TEACHER OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p><em>Truth Lessons</em> is according to the Lord&rsquo;s move among us. For this reason, we must attend the home meetings, and we must receive the education from <em>Truth Lessons.</em> In order to use <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we must first produce teachers of the truth. We should not think that it is so difficult to be a teacher of the truth and that only a few people can be teachers. Everyone can be a teacher of the truth. For example, an elderly brother, who has been exercising in the church for many years, can teach the truth. He can read the title and outline of a lesson and then ask everyone to read the title and outline. Anyone can lead a class by reading in this way and by having everyone ask questions. It is like teaching mathematics in elementary school. A person simply needs to clearly state that one plus one equals two, write the equation on the blackboard, and ask the students to copy the equation and repeat it.</p>
<p>After reading the outline, the teacher should give an overview of the lesson and the saints should read the lesson together. Each lesson has more than seven pages, and it takes about five minutes to read each page. It is unwise for a teacher to speak too much or use his own words and expressions. The teachers do not need to add anything, because there are sufficient nutrients in the teaching material. The best way to teach <em>Truth Lessons</em> is to lead the saints to read the text and to speak according to the text. We should speak and read the truth that is written in the text and not use our own words. It is more supplying for the saints to read in this way than to listen to the speech of a famous person. May we enter into this practice.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING WATCHFUL AND READY<br />
AND BEING FAITHFUL AND DILIGENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:37-42, 44, 51; 25:1-30</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE WORD OF GRACE<br />
AND THE WORD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>All Christians love Scripture verses such as John 3:16, which says, &ldquo;God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life&rdquo;; Matthew 1:21, which says, &ldquo;You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins&rdquo;; and 11:28, which says, &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; They also love the nine blessings in Matthew 5. However, not many Christians appreciate the word in Matthew 24 and 25.</p>
<p>Matthew 24 and 25 speak of slaves and virgins. Regardless of whether we are brothers or sisters, we are virgins as well as slaves before God. Just as we acknowledge that believing in the Lord and being saved are important, we must also acknowledge that the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24 and 25 is important. Just as we love the words &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest,&rdquo; we should also remember the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24 and 25 concerning the Lord settling accounts with us when He returns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EVIL SLAVE AND THE FOOLISH VIRGINS<br />
BEING TRUE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Matthew 24:51 says that the Lord will cut asunder the evil slave. The Brethren taught that only false believers will be cut asunder. They maintained that the Lord Jesus would not cut asunder a believer who was redeemed with His blood. Therefore, they said that the five foolish virgins and the evil and slothful slave in chapter 25 are false believers. This teaching gave rise to many disputes.</p>
<p>In John 10:28-29 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father...is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; Based on these verses, the Brethren taught that once we are saved, our salvation is eternally secure; therefore, they argued that genuine believers could not be cut asunder or shut outside the door. However, those who know the Bible know that the Lord would not set a false believer over His household and that a false believer cannot go forth to meet the Bridegroom with a lighted lamp. Hence, we should not say that the foolish virgins are false believers. A father with several children would never say that the clever ones are his real children, but the foolish ones are false children. In the same principle, we should not say that someone is a false slave simply because he is evil and slothful.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13:24-30 the Lord said that the enemy sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and that the tares and the wheat are growing together. The tares are false believers, and the Lord is waiting until the end of the age to weed out the tares, bind them into bundles, and burn them. In chapter 25, however, the virgins die and then are resurrected. The virgins are resurrected believers who are raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat to render an account to the Lord. A false believer would not be raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat to give an account to the Lord. Therefore, the prudent virgins are true believers, and the foolish virgins are also true believers. The good and faithful slaves are true believers, and the evil and slothful slaves are also true believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE CUT ASUNDER MEANING TO BE CUT OFF<br />
FROM OUR FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24 and 25, we will either receive a reward from the Lord or be cut asunder by Him in the future. The phrase <em>cut asunder</em> means &ldquo;to cut apart.&rdquo; In John 15 the Lord said that He is the true vine, we are the branches, and He will take away any branch that does not bear fruit (vv. 1-2, 5). According to our experience and knowledge of the truth, the Lord cuts off from the vine tree any branch that does not bear fruit. He does not simply cut the branch in two.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 1:21 says, &ldquo;The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; When we were baptized, we entered into an organic union with the Lord. When we fellowship with Him, touch His presence, and enjoy His riches, we are one with Him. Sometimes, however, we are separated from the Lord because we commit sin. Even though the Lord has not cut us off, we feel as if our fellowship with the Lord has been cut off.</p>
<p>As believers our union with the Lord is eternal. However, if we are evil and slothful, the Lord will cut us off from His presence when He returns. Concerning the evil slave the master says that he &ldquo;will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth&rdquo; (Matt. 24:51). Concerning the good and faithful slave the master says, &ldquo;You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (25:21). The master then says concerning the evil and slothful slave, &ldquo;Cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth&rdquo; (v. 30). According to chapters 24 and 25, to cut the evil slave asunder means to cast him into the outer darkness. This is to cut him off from the Lord&rsquo;s presence and cast him into the outer darkness.</p>
<p>Our union with the Lord is realized through our enjoyment and fellowship. To be cut off means that we lose our fellowship with the Lord and our enjoyment of the Lord. This is a punishment, but it is not eternal perdition. A person may say to his children that whoever receives good grades will receive a reward at the end of the semester, and whoever fails will be punished by being restricted to his room. When the semester is over, the child who receives an A receives a reward, but the child who fails is restricted to his room. Whether he is in his room for half a day or for one hour, while he is in the room, he is cut off from his father&rsquo;s presence. His being shut in his room is a kind of cutting off. It temporarily cuts the child off from his relationship with his father. In the same principle, for the sake of God&rsquo;s righteous ways, for His government, and for our benefit, we will be cut off from the Lord if we are slothful.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD DELIVERING HIS POSSESSIONS<br />
TO EVERY BELIEVER</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the Lord has given us the divine life, truth, and the proper practice. The light that is being released in these days from the Lord&rsquo;s Word is very clear. If we want the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to spread and increase, we must be strengthened in the matters of begetting, nourishing, and teaching. We are not Christianity, in which most of the people are &ldquo;pew members&rdquo; and only a small number are hired as preachers or pastors because they studied theology. Most Christians think that spreading the gospel, holding home meetings, and teaching the truth are not for the &ldquo;pew members.&rdquo; In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, however, we must all spread the gospel, hold home meetings, and teach the truth.</p>
<p>In Matthew 25:1 the Lord said, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.&rdquo; This indicates that every believer is a virgin. In 24:40-41 the Lord said, &ldquo;Two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left.&rdquo; In order for the two men to be working in the field and the two women to be grinding at the mill, they must be living. The ten virgins in chapter 25 become drowsy and sleep (v. 5). This means that they die. The two believers in chapter 24 are living, and the ten virgins in chapter 25 have died. Two plus ten equals twelve. According to numerical significance, the number twelve represents all of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>The fact that the ten virgins become drowsy and sleep while they wait for the bridegroom indicates that when the Lord returns, the majority of the believers will have died. Both the foolish and the prudent virgins die. The faithful saints, such as Paul, die, and the slothful saints also die. When the Lord returns, only a small number of believers will still be alive. Some of the believers who are living will be raptured and some will be left. This concerns all of God&rsquo;s people, not only the pastors and preachers. The Lord delivers His possessions to all His slaves, not to only a few of His slaves. He delivers His possessions to those who were strong and capable and to those who were weak and not as capable. This parable shows that every believer should serve the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR LIVING TODAY BEING TO SERVE THE LORD</h2>
<p>We did not appoint leaders in the home meetings, because as soon as there is a leader, the saints stop functioning. Any brother in a home meeting can baptize a gospel friend who wants to be baptized. The principle should be the same in the church service. The Lord Jesus sees all believers as virgins and slaves. According to life, all the believers should be chaste virgins; they should be pure in heart. Whether they are male or female, young or old, their eyes should be fixed on the Lord, and they should not have any other goal. Every believer should be like this. Even though we are living in the world, we are going forth to meet our Bridegroom with our lamps. The lamp is our testimony. In the aspect of life we go out of the world to meet the Lord, bearing His testimony.</p>
<p>In the aspect of work we are the Lord&rsquo;s slaves, and our living is to serve the Lord. A full-timer is a person who lives unto the Lord and is for the Lord; his person, life, living, and career are unto the Lord and for the Lord. A person who has the ability to conduct business but not the gift of preaching the gospel should offer the money he makes for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>In Luke 16:9 the Lord said, &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.&rdquo; We can use unrighteous mammon to spread the gospel and save sinners. The money we offer is used to buy Bibles and spiritual books or to support the full-timers who preach the gospel; therefore, people are saved. Our giving enables us to participate in their salvation.</p>
<p>Those who love the Lord will be surprised to see crowds of people welcoming them when they meet the Lord. Someone may never go to America, but because his money went there for the work, there will be Americans saying that they were helped by him. Those who are saved through his offering are credited to his heavenly account. The brothers who do business and use their money only to buy land, houses, or stock are not faithful. A person who uses his money faithfully for the Lord&rsquo;s need is living full time unto the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING WATCHFUL AND READY<br />
AND BEING FAITHFUL AND DILIGENT</h2>
<p>The full-timers should work diligently on the campuses and in the towns and villages. They should also go door to door to visit people. Whomever they bring to salvation will be credited to their heavenly account. Apart from taking care of their living and their children&rsquo;s education, the believers with jobs should use their money absolutely for the Lord. Any person who is saved and perfected through their offering will be credited to their account, and the churches that are built up through their offering will also be credited to their account. Working full time for the Lord and making money full time for the Lord are two ways to effectively use the Lord&rsquo;s gift. This is what Matthew 25 refers to when it says that the slave who received five talents gained another five talents (v. 16). The talents given by the Lord refer to grace, which is a gift. We should use this grace to earn interest.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us physical health, good education, and a proper environment. We should not forget the source of all that we enjoy. Everything we have is from the Lord. He is the source. According to the Lord&rsquo;s grace His ministry is here; otherwise, we would not succeed in any of our endeavors. Even the full-timers would not succeed. Hence, we should not waste our days. One day the Lord will say, &ldquo;I gave you talents by placing you in the church and giving you the truth. I also gave you a good job and good health, and I met your needs. What did you do with your talents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord has shown us that the three crucial matters needed in building up the church are begetting, nourishing, and teaching. We must seize the opportunity to serve, even if we are newly baptized brothers and sisters. We are all virgins and slaves. As virgins we must be watchful and ready, and as slaves we must be faithful and diligent. Being watchful and ready means that we fellowship with the Lord every day so that our lamps shine brightly. We must also buy oil, which signifies the Holy Spirit. The Spirit in our spirit enables us to shine. However, it is not enough to rely on the oil that is in our lamps; we also need oil in our vessels. The oil in our vessel can be added to our lamp whenever there is a need. Our vessel is our soul, and our lamp is our spirit. The Spirit should be not only in our spirit. He also needs to fill and saturate our entire being, including our mind, emotion, and will. The prudent virgins have oil in their lamps, and they also have plenty of oil in their vessels.</p><h2 class="head1">PAYING THE PRICE IN OUR LIVING TO GAIN OIL</h2>
<p>We must pay a price in order to gain oil. When we fellowship with the Lord in the morning, He may touch our conscience, telling us to deal with our sins against others. When we obey Him, we are inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit. This is the first step in buying oil. Throughout the day we must also live a life of buying oil. When we read the Bible and pray, we are buying oil. When we preach the gospel, we are buying oil. When we attend home meetings, we are buying oil, and when we teach <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we are buying even more oil. We cannot borrow oil. This can be compared to eating and breathing. No one can eat or breathe for us. When the Lord comes, we will be unable to borrow oil from the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>If we fellowship with the Lord when we are at home, we will have oil when we speak in the meetings. We will supply the saints, and our prayers will cause them to touch the Lord. If we watch television instead of enjoying the Lord, our prayer in the home meetings will be without oil, and we will not supply the saints.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus gave us a principle: &ldquo;Whoever has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him&rdquo; (Luke 8:18). If we spend one and a half hours contacting the Lord every Saturday, our speaking in the home meetings will be full of oil and everyone will be supplied. Because we are using the riches that the Lord gave us, we will feel that there is more oil flowing into us than there is flowing out of us. We supply others, and they supply us. Everyone gains something. In this way the church is built up. When each member fulfills his function, the meetings are fresh, living, strong, and bright, and they can attract, supply, support, and gain people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INCREASE AND BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
DEPENDING ON THOSE WHO HAVE OIL</h2>
<p>We must be people with oil. We must have oil when we preach the gospel, meet in the home meetings, and teach <em>Truth Lessons.</em> If we have oil, we will not need many words when we speak to the unbelievers who come to our home meetings. We will be able to open their hearts with a simple prayer. If we lack oil, we will be unable to speak when an unbeliever comes to our home meeting. Regardless of what we serve as refreshments, they will not want to come again, because they were not supplied. People today want and need oil. If we lead people to diligently read <em>Truth Lessons,</em> they will receive it, and they will spontaneously enter into the truth.</p>
<p>During the classes on <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we must lead the saints to read each lesson, but we should not explain too much. The classes should be small, and we should fellowship after reading. If the saints cannot digest the text, they should take it home and read it again. If we do this faithfully for fifty-two weeks every year, the lessons will become the riches within the saints that they can apply, and they will have oil when they preach the gospel, meet in the home meetings, and teach the truth. Through such a practice the church will be built up, the number of believers will increase, and those who are cold and backslidden will begin meeting again. The church will spontaneously multiply and increase.</p>
<p>Regrettably, some brothers and sisters still emphasize the big meetings. In the home meetings there are children, young people, and old people. There might be only ten people in the meeting and not one of them is talented. They do not know how to speak eloquently, and they sing out of tune. This is the reason that some people do not want to attend the home meetings. They consider the big meetings to be better. However, the people gained in the big meetings are not as stable as the people gained through the home meetings. Those who are saved in the big meetings do not know anyone. When the meeting ends, everyone is dismissed, and there is no solid contact. If two home meetings save one person every week, the four hundred home meetings in the church in Taipei will have two hundred new ones. These two hundred new ones are the personal contacts of the brothers and sisters. Therefore, they will be stable and more likely to remain.</p>
<p>Every home meeting has approximately seven or eight people. When we say that Taipei has four hundred home meetings, we mean that more than three thousand people are actively meeting in the homes. This may seem insignificant, but it is more effective than a big meeting. Any society that relies only on outward show cannot be built up. The practice in modern society is to encourage stable families. In this way society has a proper structure and can be healthy. This also applies to the church. It is not practical for the church to have big meetings every day. The most practical way is for everyone to meet in the homes to supply and care for one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DILIGENTLY BEGETTING, NOURISHING,<br />
AND TEACHING EVERY DAY</h2>
<p>We must diligently read the Bible, pray, visit others, preach the gospel, build up home meetings, and teach <em>Truth Lessons.</em> We cannot be lazy in any of these things. We should never think that we can be loose because the Lord has not come for two thousand years, even though He said that He comes quickly. Even though He delays, we will meet Him one day. We must be prepared to meet Him. We cannot prepare in one day; we need a lifetime to prepare. We cannot wait until we are about to die before we prepare to settle accounts with the Lord. We must prepare daily. The brothers who have gone before us are patterns. They spent their entire lives preparing to meet the Lord because they feared that they would not be ready when the Lord comes.</p>
<p>We are now in the age of grace, and our salvation is eternally secure. After the age of grace is the age of the kingdom of righteousness, in which the Lord will settle accounts with us according to His righteousness. We will either be rewarded or punished for one thousand years. This is not a light matter. We are considering this serious matter in order to encourage everyone to diligently and faithfully participate in begetting, nourishing, and teaching. Our preparing to meet the Lord can be compared to saving money in a bank account. We do not save all our money in one day; instead, we save our money gradually. We must daily seek to be filled with the Holy Spirit, deal with our sins, and have proper fellowship with the Lord so that we mature in life and our work is accepted by the Lord. If we do these things, we will be rewarded at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. We will participate in His wedding feast, partake of His joy, enter into the kingdom, and reign together with Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF THE MEETINGS<br />
AFTER CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>When we began changing the system, we spoke of our goals. We said that we are changing the system to eliminate the traditional Christian way of meeting, to give the brothers and sisters the opportunity to exercise their organic function in the meetings, to support the brothers and sisters who meet regularly, to recover the ones who have not met for a long time, and to bring in new ones. By doing this, the church can multiply and increase, and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will have a future. Furthermore, we will be able to gospelize Taiwan within the next few years. We cannot say that we have been successful in these matters, but we are seeing the initial signs of success. Instead of going backward, we are making progress, and we are increasing, not decreasing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM NOT BEING EASY</h2>
<p>Since changing the system involves eliminating old habits and developing new habits, everyone is affected. Human beings are accustomed to old things and old ways. We are subconsciously accustomed to and prefer old things. Hence, it is difficult and inconvenient for us to begin something new. For example, when I first wore Western suits, I felt that they were not as comfortable as Chinese gowns. Western suits have a shirt with buttons on the collars and the sleeves, they need a necktie, and the trousers need to be worn with a belt. However, I made the change, and I have been wearing Western suits for approximately forty years. Now I do not feel that the Chinese gowns are comfortable. I am no longer accustomed to wearing them. This shows that we can become accustomed to new things.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for older people to change their ways. In some families each member has a designated seat at the dinner table. It is difficult for an elderly person to sit in a different chair because he is accustomed to sitting in a particular chair, even though the chairs are the same. He must also sit at a particular distance from the table; otherwise, he is unable to eat his meal.</p>
<p>This example shows that it is not easy to change our habits. Therefore, we must sympathize with the older brothers and sisters because it is difficult for them to become accustomed to new things. It is especially difficult for the older saints, because in changing the system we no longer emphasize the big meetings, and the small group meetings may not seem to be conducted in an orderly way. In spite of these changes, we are still in the process; we have not arrived at the goal. Even though our progress is not ideal, we are moving forward, not backward, and our numbers have increased, not decreased. We are making progress in the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF OUR ACTUAL SITUATION</h2>
<p>Even though we have changed the system and set new goals, we are not ignoring our actual situation. In every country, whether it is Christian or non-Christian, most people do not work, and they do not go to school on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; they are free on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s Day is the best day for us to hold a meeting.</p>
<p>Over the past two centuries, Christianity has been a part of the Western influence that spread in the East. The influence of Christianity has even affected all the countries in the world. Hence, going to &ldquo;church&rdquo; to worship on the Lord&rsquo;s Day is a common practice, and Christmas, which is not according to the truth, is celebrated by Christians and non-Christians around the globe. These are common practices. Everyone is accustomed to Christians worshipping on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; hence, we do not need to be an exception.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He went to the synagogues to preach the gospel on the Sabbath (Mark 1:21; Luke 4:16). However, He had no intention of keeping the Sabbath. He clearly said that with His coming, the Sabbath is over (Matt. 12:8). He also had no intention of worshipping God in the synagogues, but He went to the synagogues on the Sabbath to teach, to preach the gospel, to perform miracles, to cast out demons, and to heal the sick. The apostles did the same thing. The apostle Paul went to the synagogues in Gentile lands when he was on his ministry journeys. In those days the Jews were not the only ones meeting in the synagogues. Many God-seeking Gentiles also met in the synagogues because of the Jewish influence. For this reason, when Paul went to a city, he would first go to the synagogue if there were no believers in that city (Acts 9:20; 13:5, 14; 14:1). Paul even went on the Sabbath (17:1-2), but he had no intention of keeping the Sabbath. He used the time, place, and environment to preach the gospel to people.</p><h2 class="head1">ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETINGS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The General Meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day Mornings</h2>
<p>Even though we changed the system, we still consider the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings to be important. We hope that all the churches will have a general meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In this general meeting a particular and weighty message should be given for the benefit of all and to attract people. We emphasize this matter because some of the older brothers and sisters, who have been meeting with us for a long time, cannot get used to the district meetings or even to the small groups, and we cannot force them to like these meetings. For the sake of these brothers and sisters we need a meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, this meeting must not become a routine; it must be proper and weighty. We should look to the Lord concerning how to conduct this meeting. Even though the carrying out of this meeting will depend on the situation and capacity of each locality, we should continue to hold it on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We cannot stop the general big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day simply because we changed the system.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em></h2>
<p>The church is the pillar and base of the truth (1 Tim. 3:15); hence, every believer should pursue the truth. Every believer should also know the truth because God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth (2:4). According to the teaching of the Bible, we are obligated to teach the truth to the brothers and sisters. In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord charged us, saying, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age&rdquo; (28:19-20). Therefore, teaching the truth is a crucial matter. We must confess that in the past we did not teach the truth sufficiently. Even though we paid attention to this matter, we were not detailed or focused in our emphasis. After many years of experience, we confess that we have lost much grace and blessing in this matter.</p>
<p>In order to aid the change in the system, we have published <em>Truth Lessons.</em> These lessons should not be spoken as ordinary messages; rather, they should be presented in the way of education, because they contain biblical truths. These lessons should be taught to the saints in sequence. After a few lessons, the saints will get a taste for the lessons. The special feature of <em>Truth Lessons</em> is that they do not touch one topic here and then mention another topic. Rather, they are like an educational course compiled in a systematic way to be taught to the saints step by step.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Revelation of the Truth Being Progressive</h2>
<p>When we read <em>Truth Lessons,</em> there are some matters concerning the revelation of the truth that we must know. When the Roman emperor Constantine called the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325, only twenty books of the New Testament had been recognized as authoritative. The remaining seven books&mdash;Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and Revelation&mdash;were recognized seventy-two years later at the Council of Carthage in A.D. 397. In this council the leaders of the churches gathered together and recognized these books as being authoritative. Hence, we have the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. Many people have been Christians for many years, but they still do not know that the New Testament has twenty-seven books.</p>
<p>Christians, including those in the Catholic Church and in major Protestant denominations, believe in a creed as well as the Bible. A creed is a set of religious beliefs. The use of the word <em>creed</em> was determined at the Council of Nicaea. Constantine the Great wanted to use Christianity to unite the Roman Empire because it was difficult for him to exercise his authority over His vast empire in which the people held many different concepts. However, even the Bible expositors and theologians were not united because of their opinions. Hence, Constantine used his position as emperor to make a decree ordering all the great theologians and Bible teachers to hold a council in Nicaea in A.D. 325. Constantine himself was the moderator of this council in which the theologians and Bible teachers researched and debated the truth. As a result, under the authority of the Roman Empire all the theologians and Bible teachers came to an agreement in their beliefs. This agreement was written down and became the Nicene Creed. The Nicene Creed was written before the entire New Testament was recognized in A.D. 397.</p>
<p>Catholics, Anglicans, and other Christian groups recite the Nicene Creed every Lord&rsquo;s Day. This creed, however, does not speak of the seven Spirits. The most important part of any book is its conclusion, regardless of what the book expounds or reveals. The Bible also has a conclusion. It begins with the book of Genesis and concludes with the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits; hence, without the book of Revelation the other sixty-five books of the Bible do not have a conclusion.</p><h2 class="head3">The Progression and Peak of<br />
the Divine Revelation concerning the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Genesis 1 speaks of God&rsquo;s creation and says that the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters (v. 2). Other portions of the Old Testament also refer to the Spirit. They say that the Spirit of Jehovah came upon a person and that the Spirit of Jehovah caused people to prophesy (Judg. 3:10; 1 Sam. 10:6). The New Testament speaks of the Holy Spirit before the birth of the Lord Jesus, saying that the Holy Spirit came upon Mary, and she conceived of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:20). The New Testament also speaks of the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), that is, the Spirit of the incarnated and crucified Savior, and it speaks of the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of the resurrected Lord. There is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), and the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). These titles are according to the divine revelation concerning the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>All theologians agree that the divine revelation did not develop in a quick way; rather, it developed gradually. The development of the truth can be compared to the sun rising at dawn and shining brighter and brighter until it reaches its zenith. The revelation concerning the Holy Spirit reaches its zenith in the book of Revelation. Genesis is the dawning of the divine revelation, after which the divine revelation gradually shines brighter until it reaches its zenith in Revelation. We can say that in the book of Revelation the divine revelation reaches high noon.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation, however, was not yet recognized when the Council of Nicaea was held. Therefore, in relation to the divine revelation, the Council of Nicaea did not define its creed at noontime but only at about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning. This creed lacks the revelation contained in Revelation and in Hebrews. Without these two precious books, the Bible has two large holes. These two books, however, were not recognized at the time of the Council of Nicaea. The Creed instituted by this Council was not perfect or complete, because the divine revelation had not arrived at noon, at its zenith.</p>
<p>By the time I went to America more than twenty years ago, I had received much light from the Lord concerning the Spirit. Christianity in America had not seen the light that I had received, and many theologians could not receive it. They were very uncomfortable after they heard me speak. Many people exhorted me in love to not speak these things in America, because the Christians here could not receive what I spoke. They said that even though the Bible contains these matters, the people could not receive them. I responded that if I did not speak these things, I would have nothing to say, and there would be no need for me to be in America. There was no need for me to speak other things, because there are many pastors and theologians in America. The Lord had revealed many things to me; hence, I had a definite burden in coming to America. I must overcome all criticism and do my best to speak what I have seen. I must also print my messages in books.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1969 we held a conference in Ohio. Before the conference I received a burden from the Lord to speak concerning the seven Spirits. This was the first time I released a message on the seven Spirits, and everyone was shocked. After the messages were printed, the word and the light concerning the seven Spirits silenced the Christians in America who formerly disagreed with my speaking on the Spirit. When Christians showed us the Nicene Creed, we explained that the Nicene Creed was incomplete and fell short of the divine revelation because it was written in A.D. 325 before Revelation and Hebrews were recognized. After this explanation the Christians did not have anything more to say.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Emphasizing Education with Truth Lessons</h2>
<p>We need to receive the education in <em>Truth Lessons.</em> Every volume of <em>Truth Lessons</em> contains twelve to twenty detailed lessons. Let us consider lesson 14 in Volume 2 of Level 1. This lesson is on the Old Testament prophets. It presents the five prophets before the age of the prophets&mdash;four in Judah and one Gentile&mdash;and the prophets that were raised up during the age of the prophets, including the twelve minor prophets. It is not easy to memorize the order of the twelve minor prophets. However, we should study the important points of their prophecies concerning the Lord Jesus. Even if we forget these important points, by carefully studying these books, the riches will be deposited into us.</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of being discouraged, we should persevere with endurance. Our laboring in the truth can be compared to completing a four-year curriculum at a university. The speech, attitude, and expressions of a person who graduates from a university are different from those of a person who never attended a university. We hope the brothers and sisters will labor diligently in the truth.</p>
<p>Here is another example. When we came to Taiwan more than thirty years ago, the outward circumstances were very discouraging because the people were backward in both their speech and dress. The situation now is completely different because the government has worked hard, and there are many college students. Everyone has developed their intellect and potential because they have received a good education. This has made the economy robust and the society wealthy. In the same principle, if the Lord&rsquo;s testimony is to have a way on earth, we must be educated in the truth.</p>
<p>It is a gradual process to be educated in the truth. Outwardly it seems as if there is no revival, but things are very solid inwardly. We are doing the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, not a work of excitement. This is a work of life in which we help the saints grow in life, and it is a work of truth in which the saints are cultivated in the truth. The church in Taipei has definitely been doing quite well in these two aspects.</p><h2 class="head2">The Bread-breaking Meetings</h2>
<p>Apart from the general big meetings and the meetings to teach <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we also need a meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day to remember the Lord as our source and to fellowship with Him. In this meeting we must learn to fellowship with the Lord and remember Him as our source. Because we belong to the Lord, we must have a meeting to remember Him. The arrangements for this meeting must be very sober. The brothers and sisters have paid much attention to the table meeting, and more people attend this meeting than attend the other meetings. This is a good sign.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Small Group Meetings</h2>
<p>We also need the meetings in the homes, the small group meetings. We must practice the small group meetings in order to overturn the traditional Christian way of meeting. There is no form in the small group meetings; everyone can speak and function. It does not matter whether we refer to these meetings as home meetings or small group meetings; there is no need to argue about the name. We simply need to let people know that we have such a meeting once a week. It is best to have this meeting on Saturday. However, because Saturdays may not be convenient for some brothers and sisters, they can hold this meeting on another day. Whether this meeting is on Saturday or another day, all the brothers and sisters should open their homes once a week to have a small group meeting or a home meeting. This is a basic meeting.</p>
<p>The small group meetings are the foundation for building up the church. The three meetings we have discussed are for preparing the materials to build up the church. The general big meetings are for gathering the materials, the meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em> are for preparing the materials, and the table meetings are for maintaining the freshness of the materials. The actual building takes place in the small group meetings. The small group meetings are the foundation for building up the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Prayer Meetings and Other Meetings</h2>
<p>The fifth meeting that we need is the prayer meeting of the church. We need the saints to pray individually, and we need all the saints to come together and pray at least once a week. This gives us five kinds of meetings that cover different aspects of the church life: the general big meetings, the meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em> in separate classes, the bread-breaking meetings, the small group or home meetings, and the prayer meetings. In addition to these meetings, there are other meetings, such as co-workers&rsquo; meetings, elders&rsquo; meetings, training meetings, and service meetings. We cannot make general arrangements for these other meetings. Each locality must make arrangements for these meetings according to their respective situations and needs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SMALL GROUP MEETINGS BEING THE BASE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We cannot eliminate any of these five meetings. The big meetings are for gathering people as the materials, and the meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em> are for preparing the materials. In the bread-breaking meetings our heart is turned to the Lord so that we can be burning toward Him, thus, maintaining the freshness of the materials. The prayer meetings are for the carrying out of the prayer ministry of the church. In addition to these meetings there is the small group meeting. This is the most important meeting for the building up of the church. The function of this meeting is to sustain the brothers and sisters, to recover those who have not been meeting, and to bring in new ones. The ability of the church to increase depends on the condition of the small group meetings, because in the small group meetings there are mutual fellowship, care, shepherding, and exhortation, which constitute the base for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>There are presently three or four thousand brothers and sisters meeting regularly in the church in Taipei. In the past the church in Taipei had only eight to ten elders, and there was no way for them to care for so many people. Presently there are more than eighty elders, but there is still no way for them to adequately care for all the saints. Therefore, all the brothers and sisters must function in the small group meetings and bear the responsibility to feed and care for one another. It is easy for eight to ten people, who meet together once a week in a small group meeting, to know one another. Moreover, even if they do not have any feeling for one another, after meeting together two or three times, they will begin to care for one another, because human beings are social by nature and rich in emotions. They will know one another and care for one another&rsquo;s condition, health, and job. Instead of feeling as if they are strangers, they will be concerned for one another and cherish one another. There will be a sweet feeling in the meeting.</p>
<p>In a society everyone has social relationships. No person wants to live alone for a long time, regardless of his social status, education, or financial condition. He will always want to return to society in order to continue his existence. The believers in the church life need to know that since the church is the assembly of the called-out ones, the members need to contact and fellowship with one another. We can testify that without the church our existence does not have meaning.</p>
<p>Some elderly people exercise by walking or running every day to maintain mobility. Other elderly people do not exercise their bodies or their minds, and as a result they become less mobile and deteriorate mentally. It is possible for them to forget how to return home if they go out by themselves. This shows that we cannot stop being active or exercising. Our bodies and our minds become stronger and more flexible when we exercise.</p>
<p>For example, even though I speak for one or two hours when I give a message, I do not feel physically tired. If I am not allowed to speak, I will not be able to eat or sleep well. I am more than eighty years old. I will become ill if I do nothing and do not give any messages. After giving a message, I frequently sleep peacefully and soundly through the night. I am presently working at least one and a half times more than I did ten years ago. In order to maintain my health, I force myself to walk at least half an hour every day. Without this exercise I do not have any strength. A person who lives to be eighty but is inactive or has no goal in his life may quickly go to his grave. The human mind and body need to be used. We should not stop using them simply because we are old. We should not retire too early, because early retirement makes people useless. We must continue working. In other words, we need regular and adequate exercise.</p>
<p>Our regular and adequate spiritual exercise is in the small group meetings. We must spend our energy on the small group meetings. The number of people in a small group meeting should not exceed ten. It is best if there are only seven or eight people. If the number in the meeting exceeds twelve people, the meeting should be split into two groups. Because human beings are social, it will not be easy for us to split a meeting after the saints meet together for a period of time. Initially the members of a group might not know one another, but gradually they will feel that the meetings have flavor because they know one another, care for one another, and fan one another into flame. Gradually, their number may increase to twelve, fifteen, or even twenty. Then they will feel that it is difficult to split the meeting into two groups.</p>
<p>However, a meeting that does not split into two groups will not spread. Therefore, the meeting must split. We hope that every home will have a meeting, and that these meetings will flourish and split until the home of every brother and sister has a small group meeting. In one of the large apartment complexes there are five households of saints who live next to each other. Some of these brothers and sisters have manifested their function. Therefore, we hope that there would be five small group meetings in that complex. Then everyone in that complex can be cared for.</p>
<p>We cannot give up the small group meetings. They have a specific function in the practical building up of the church. When we began changing the system, we said that everything we were doing was an experiment, because this was our first time to take the new way. We were in the experimental stage. In our heart we felt as though we were walking on thin ice, and we were trying different things. We have finished the period of research and experimenting, and we feel very good. In particular, we feel good that many brothers and sisters have a meeting in their home. It is not sufficient for the saints to fellowship only with family members; they need the group meetings. There is a need for fellowship among different families. For example, three families can come together to form a small group. There is a need for homes and for small group meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">SETTING UP MEETINGS ACCORDING TO<br />
THE PRACTICAL NEED IN EACH LOCALITY</h2>
<p>I hope that every meeting hall will have a general big meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning as well as a meeting for teaching <em>Truth Lessons.</em> I also hope that <em>Truth Lessons</em> will be taught in classes according to the different levels of the saints. It is best for the bread-breaking meetings to be held in the districts. According to our present situation, we cannot have the bread-breaking meeting in every home even though the saints in the initial church life broke bread from house to house (Acts 2:46). The early church broke bread from house to house every day. They probably remembered the Lord before every meal. At that time the believers were very zealous for the Lord. Our practice of having the bread-breaking meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day is also according to the Bible. Even though Acts 2:46 speaks of the saints breaking bread every day in their homes, 20:7 shows that the saints came together to break the bread on the first day of the week. It gradually became a pattern in the early church life to hold the bread-breaking meeting on the first day of the week.</p>
<p>Some of the older responsible brothers may have difficulty getting used to the change in our practice. Previously a new one could partake of the table only after he had been formally introduced, and we would never allow anyone to casually break bread in his home or even hold a separate bread-breaking meeting. Such matters were practiced only after the elders fellowshipped and prayed and then made a decision. We are making a great turn that is difficult for the older brothers to receive.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we are making a turn; on the other hand, we are not making a turn. The truth cannot be changed, but we can make changes in our practice. For example, we are Chinese, and we used to wear Chinese gowns, but we made a change and we now wear Western suits. In spite of the change in our clothing, we have not made a change in our person. As another example, in the early days of the Republic of China, children in the countryside wore their hair in long braids. Later with the change in the environment, they cut off their braids. However, the children were still the same even though their hairstyle changed.</p>
<p>It does not matter whether we have the bread-breaking meeting in the meeting halls or in the homes. We should not make any rules about this matter; instead, the saints in each locality must consider their situation and do what is best. One brother fellowshipped that because the saints in his area live far apart from each other, few saints are able to gather and break bread together. Hence, they have no choice but to have table meetings in small groups according to where the clusters of saints live. When they began meeting in this way, the number of saints in the table meetings actually increased. This is what it means to arrange things according to the local situation. We do not need to have the same practice in every locality.</p>
<p>This also applies to the prayer meeting. On the one hand, if the brothers and sisters gather to pray in many different places, the prayer may not be strong, and there may not be many saints in the meeting. On the other hand, if we all meet together to pray, there will be too many people in the meeting, and not everyone will have the opportunity to function. Therefore, we must examine our situation. We can pray in smaller districts and come together for a large corporate prayer meeting once a month. We should not have any regulations concerning the prayer meeting. For example, the many meeting halls in the church in Taipei do not need to have their meetings at the same time. Each meeting hall should be allowed to set the times for its meetings according to the need of the saints.</p>
<p>Concerning splitting the small group meetings, some small groups have not reached the stage of maturity, so these groups should not be split. However, this should not be taken as an excuse to continue meeting according to our habit. The goal of these meetings is to give all the brothers and sisters the opportunity to speak and function by shepherding one another, recovering the dormant saints, and bringing in new ones. According to this principle, if a group is split before it reaches the desired goal, the saints will scatter. It is best to wait until a group matures before splitting it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OPENING OUR HOMES FOR MEETINGS<br />
BEING THE BEST WAY TO RECEIVE THE BLESSING</h2>
<p>I want to exhort all the brothers and sisters to open their homes for the saints to meet. This is the best way for believers to receive the blessing. We belong to the living Lord. We should, therefore, be for the Lord&rsquo;s interests on the earth. All the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery truly love the Lord and want to make Him happy. Hence, we must exhort one another by pointing out that the best way to receive the blessing is to open up our homes. When we open our homes, our families will be blessed, and our relatives, friends, and neighbors will also receive a blessing. This is scriptural.</p>
<p>There are several patterns in the New Testament of believers meeting in homes. On the day of Pentecost the new believers met together in their homes. We believe that they did this to gain the benefit, not just to meet a need. If there had been no need or benefit, they would not have had this practice. On the day of their salvation, they heard Peter&rsquo;s message, were baptized, and then opened their homes to meet together. They must have met in their homes to receive the blessing.</p>
<p>In Acts 10 there is the example of Cornelius. Even before Cornelius knew the Lord Jesus or heard the gospel from Peter, that is, before he was saved, he had a meeting in his home. Cornelius prayed frequently because he had received the Old Testament Scriptures from the Jews and knew something concerning the things of God. Based on these facts we believe that he probably sat with his family members to discuss God. This was a home meeting. When the angel appeared to Cornelius and told him to invite Peter, Cornelius obeyed the angel (vv. 5-8). He then prepared his home and invited his relatives and intimate friends before Peter arrived (v. 24). Cornelius had a proper group meeting in his home before he was saved. After Peter came and preached the gospel, all the members of the household of Cornelius were immediately saved.</p>
<p>There was no church near the house of Cornelius, but that does not mean that they did not meet together after Peter left. What did they do without any so-called older or leading brothers? We must believe that Cornelius was the leading brother. This means that Cornelius was the elder. Cornelius was also the deacon, he was the one who visited and cared for the others. This is the pattern in the Bible. Every believer should be like Cornelius after his salvation. We believe that the house of Cornelius, his family members, did not stop meeting after they were baptized. In the early days of the church life there was the atmosphere of opening the homes.</p>
<p>Another example is Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed goods, whose whole house was saved and baptized (16:14-15). In addition to being saved and baptized, she also opened up her home for meetings. Hence, before leaving Philippi, Paul went to her house and saw the brothers (v. 40). Paul did not remain in Philippi to care for them. This household was saved before there was a church in Philippi; therefore, they must have begun meeting in their own home.</p>
<p>As another example, in Philippi Paul preached the gospel to the jailer and his household. After hearing the gospel, the jailer and his household were baptized on the same day, and they were joyful (vv. 30-34). Paul, however, did not remain with them. I believe that the household of this jailer continued to meet even after Paul left. I also believe that the church in Philippi began in this household. In the New Testament the church in Philippi is a good church. Thus, the small group meetings are very important. Any church that begins with small group meetings will definitely be strong.</p>
<p>Although we are saved, we will still be cold at times. A weekly meeting in our home will help us and restrict us. It will be a preservation and blessing to us. This meeting will help every member of our family. On the day that the meeting is in our home, we will be restrained from arguing freely. This is a preservation because it helps a husband and wife to respect each other. There are many benefits when we open our home for a home meeting.</p>
<p>We have lost many opportunities to receive the blessing. We also owe a huge debt to our friends, neighbors, and relatives. If we open our home for a meeting, after a period of time everyone will know that we have a meeting, and they will come to see what we are doing. If we do not have a meeting in our home, even though we have been saved for three to five years, our friends, neighbors, and relatives will only know that we always go to the meeting hall, particularly on Saturdays and Sundays. They will not know what we do at the meeting hall. However, if we have a meeting in our home, everyone will eventually know that we have a meeting, and they may unexpectedly find us meeting together when they come to visit us. In this way they will hear the word of the gospel and receive salvation. There are only blessings and benefits when we open our homes for meetings. We will not suffer any loss.</p>
<p>We can also learn to sing hymns in the home meetings. The new brothers and sisters do not know how to sing the hymns. If we also do not know how to sing the hymns, when we have a meeting in their homes, we will only be able to read the hymns, not sing them. Today all the schools in Taiwan teach music using simplified notation. This should make it easy for us to sing. If we are willing to learn, we will eventually be able to sing the hymns.</p>
<p>To meet the need of the home meetings, it is good to have a few extra Bibles in our homes. It is possible that our children will read the Bible while they are playing. They might read the sentence &ldquo;Let no one despise your youth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 4:12) and be influenced by it, because they are astonished that the Bible contains such a sentence. They may also read the portion that says, &ldquo;Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me&rdquo; (Matt. 19:14). Even though they are playing, the Lord can use this to impress them with His love for them. Hence, it is good to have extra Bibles in our homes. Even if the meetings in our homes do not seem so good, we will receive the blessing when we open our homes for the meetings.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters are very busy with their jobs, but they should still have a meeting. According to the Old Testament principle, God does not want His people to labor seven days a week. God wants His people to labor for six days and have one day of rest. On the day the children of Israel rested, they considered God. Initially, people in the Old Testament considered God only as their Creator. After the children of Israel left Egypt, God commanded them to keep the Sabbath (Exo. 20:8-10). On the Sabbath day the Israelites did not remember God merely as their Creator; they also remembered Him as their Redeemer. They considered how He saved their ancestors out of the land of Egypt by bringing them across the Red Sea, through the wilderness, and into the good land of Canaan to enjoy the riches of the good land. The Israelites considered all these things. This was very profitable.</p>
<p>Today a person can work only ten to twelve hours in a day. If a person works too long, it is not good for his health. We all must have a time of relaxation to alleviate our worries, or to take a walk, and, in the words of the unbelievers, to have some entertainment and recreation. When the unbelievers have entertainment and recreation, they tend to go astray and bring in numerous sinful things. We do not want to see this happen among us. We should go to meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to enjoy the Lord. This is genuine and proper recreation. In addition, we can open our homes one evening a week to allow the saints to relax and be comfortable. We should not take anything else as our enjoyment. We should read the Bible, discuss the truths of the Bible, speak of the Lord Jesus, and give testimonies, and we can play the piano to accompany our hymn singing. This is the way of blessing.</p>
<p>Whether for the sake of the church or for our proper human living, we should have one evening a week to open our home for the Lord and let our friends and neighbors know that we are Christians who fear God. Every week we should spend one evening at home. Instead of being occupied with business, we should speak about the things of the Lord with those in our family. There is no need for religious rituals. When I was young, there was also a meeting in my home, but the meetings we had were religious and formal. We do not want religious rituals; rather, we want to sing the hymns freely, discuss the Bible, and speak of the Lord to our friends and relatives. This is normal and worthwhile.</p>
<p>We can open our homes from 7:00 to 11:00 P.M. and tell our friends and relatives to come at any time during these four hours. If we will practice this, one home can bring at least one friend or relative to the Lord in a year. Even if the people who come to our meetings do not receive salvation, at least we will no longer be indebted for their salvation. However, if we do not practice this, when we go to meet the Lord, He will ask us whether we preached the gospel to our relatives, and we will not be able to say anything in response. We will not be able to settle accounts with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL THE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS<br />
WORKING TOGETHER<br />
FOR THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The home meetings are the base for the building up of the church. Initially there is one household in a home meeting. The home meeting forms a group when the number of households gradually increases to two or three. This is the most profitable way to build the church. People do not receive salvation because we have not shown them the treasure that is within us. If we invite our friends and relatives to visit us in our homes, their hearts will be touched. Even though they might not say anything, they will remember us when they encounter difficulties, or they may even come to us for fellowship. This will give us many opportunities to speak to them.</p>
<p>During the sixty years of my serving the Lord, I have never seen a place as suitable as Taiwan for the Lord&rsquo;s work. All the conditions in the environment&mdash;in communication, education, and the economy&mdash;are prepared for His work. We simply need to open our homes and regularly invite people to come so that we can preach the Lord Jesus to them. I believe that if we practice this for one year, our numbers will triple or quadruple, not just double. We must endeavor to advance.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">EVERYONE FUNCTIONING TO SPEAK<br />
FOR THE LORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OVERTHROWING THE ORDINANCES<br />
OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>By changing the system, we are overthrowing the ordinances of Christianity, in which a few people replace the function of the other members of the Body of Christ. A few members cause the other members to be unemployed and thus kill their function. Traditional Christianity does not believe that all the members can function. In traditional Christianity only the clergy, the pastors and preachers, can function. For this reason, we must rise up to eliminate the system of Christianity in our meetings. This system has the element of leaven that the Lord Jesus spoke of in Matthew 13.</p>
<p>In Matthew 13 a woman hid leaven in three measures of meal (v. 33). The three measures of meal signify Christ as food to supply God&rsquo;s people, and the woman signifies the Roman Catholic Church. History shows that not long after the church was produced, the Catholic Church brought in many different heresies, leaven, and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ. Bakers add leaven to flour to make bread easy to eat. Leavened bread is soft and easy to chew, but unleavened bread is hard and difficult to chew. According to this principle, the Catholic Church brought in many heresies in an attempt to make the truth easy for people to receive.</p>
<p>We came out of Christianity, but our Christian background is still with us, and it influences us. Christianity is influencing people all over the earth. Many people who do not believe in Jesus think that they understand Christianity. Concerning minor items, they think that Christianity involves steepled buildings with bells that ring at specific times on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and crosses on top of the steeples. This is a common concept concerning Christianity. With respect to the major items, unbelievers know that Christianity has pastors and that Christians go to worship services and listen to sermons preached by the pastors. Most people think that Christianity, as represented by the Catholic Church, is mainly composed of &ldquo;pew members,&rdquo; who do not need to do anything but attend mass. There are also priests, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. When the pope dies, another pope is chosen from among the cardinals to be his successor.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED<br />
FROM THE POISON OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Thirty years ago, when I was in the Philippines, one of the brothers had a relative who was in the hospital. This brother took several other brothers to visit his relative. At the hospital they surrounded the bed of the relative and prayed one by one. The Philippines is a Catholic country, and everyone has some knowledge of Catholicism. According to their understanding, whoever is able to pray must be a pastor. Someone in the ward asked the brothers whether they were pastors, because they prayed better than most pastors. Our brother answered that they were not pastors and that we do not have pastors in our church. This response surprised the people who were present. Christianity gives people the impression that praying and preaching are the job of pastors. This impression, this poison, is still among us. We are only a little better than Christianity.</p>
<p>Even though we changed the system, most of the brothers and sisters still do not pray or function in the meetings. They do not avoid praying, but they do not pray much. Previously our practice was to have everyone listen to a message lasting an hour and a half, after which one person would pray out loud, and then everyone else would pray silently. However, we discovered that this was not a good practice, because most people did not know what to do during the time of silent prayer. Therefore, we changed our practice to allow half an hour after the message for everyone to testify concerning the light, revelation, and help they received. This was an attempt to break the habit of only one person speaking and everyone else listening. This change gave everyone an opportunity to function and was helpful.</p>
<p>The practice of giving testimonies after the message is being carried out successfully in America. Between 1969 and 1974 the testimonies after the messages were living, and sometimes thirty minutes was not enough time. In Taiwan, however, the testimonies are almost all dead, and the same brothers and sisters always stand up to speak. This shows that there are traces of the poison of Christianity among us. In addition, those who speak tend to give long testimonies; they can even speak for fifteen minutes. This is also evidence of the poison of Christianity.</p>
<p>In the physical realm, as soon as a newborn is spanked, it begins to cry. A mother would be concerned if her child did not cry after being spanked. A child who cannot speak by the time he is eight to ten years old is dumb. Today, are the new believers among us and those who have been saved for twenty years speaking Christians, or are we dumb Christians? We speak all day without stopping, but as soon as we step into a meeting, we become dumb. We speak unceasingly outside the meetings, but we become dumb as soon as we are in the meetings.</p>
<p>It is a suffering to be in a family where some family members cannot speak. In the church life the greatest suffering is when no one speaks. What is the meaning of our existence if there is no church on the earth? If we do not speak in the meetings, where else can we speak? Our only enjoyment on the earth is to serve the Lord and the church. Thus, when we encounter someone in the church meetings who does not speak, we suffer.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE FUNCTIONING<br />
BY SPEAKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>We have been influenced by degraded Christianity to the extent that we are nearly beyond rescue. Starting from today, we must reverse our old habit of not speaking in the meetings by everyone speaking for the Lord in the meetings. The problem of not speaking in the meetings comes not only from the poison of Christianity but also from the traditional training in Chinese homes. Most Chinese parents charge their children to keep silent when they are not at home. According to a Chinese proverb&mdash;disease enters through the mouth, and misfortune issues from the mouth&mdash;we should speak as little as possible. There is a true story about a mother and her child who were invited out for dinner. The child was naturally talkative, and the mother was afraid he would say something inappropriate in the presence of others. Hence, she kept the child beside her and pinched him whenever he began to speak so that he would stop. It was an unpleasant situation with the mother pinching the child every time he spoke.</p>
<p>In the church, however, we want everyone to be like the child who wanted to speak. There is another teaching that is used in Chinese homes: &ldquo;Many words, many mistakes; few words, few mistakes; no words, no mistakes.&rdquo; We should not apply this teaching in the church; all the saints should speak in the meetings. The best situation is when all the saints speak.</p>
<p>Our God is not merely a speaking God (Heb. 1:1-2); He is the Word (John 1:1; Rev. 19:13). In the universe words are very important. Human culture comes out of words and is contained in human language. Culture cannot exist without language, and language advances with culture. First there was electricity, then electric lamps, telegraphs, and telephones were developed. Now we are more advanced, and we have televisions and other appliances. The development of names for these things proves that language advances with culture. If God did not speak in Genesis, creation would not exist. If the people God created were mute, society would not have developed. We should consider what human society would be like if people could not speak. God created us in His image and according to His likeness (Gen. 1:26-27); God can speak, and we can speak. If we could not speak or if we did not speak, we would not be like God.</p>
<p>If God did not speak, we would not have the books of Genesis through Malachi. We would be in darkness. If Matthew did not write his Gospel, Paul his Epistles, and John Revelation, there would not be a Bible, and we would be confused people. We should not rebuke the saints who have not been meeting for a long time, nor should we make demands on new believers. We must go to God&rsquo;s children and speak His word to them. We must use God&rsquo;s word to nourish and supply them. We were made according to God&rsquo;s image; we are like God. God speaks, and we also must speak His word.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament God repeatedly exhorted and charged the Israelites to teach their children the words that He had commanded them. He said, &ldquo;These words, which I command you today, shall be upon your heart; and you shall repeat them to your children, and speak about them when you sit in your house and when you journey on the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up; and you shall bind them on your hand as a sign, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes; and you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates&rdquo; (Deut. 6:6-9). When we compare our living to these words, we feel ashamed because this is not our practice. Some of us never speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in our homes; we do not speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to our children. We speak about many things, but we do not speak God&rsquo;s word. According to God&rsquo;s command, we should speak His word every day in our homes. Even though we need to read the newspaper in order to know the world situation, the reading material we set out in our homes should be the Recovery Version of the Bible, the Life-study messages, and spiritual books.</p>
<p>Some saints in Texas have the Life-study messages on their bookshelves and coffee tables, in the kitchen, and even in the bathroom. The Life-study messages can be found everywhere in their homes. This makes it convenient to read a message at any time. If we exercise to read God&rsquo;s word in this way, we will be able to speak God&rsquo;s word. We will speak to our family, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates. We will speak God&rsquo;s word everywhere. If we speak for God and speak God&rsquo;s word, the church will bear fruit for God, the atmosphere in this country will change, and society will be turned upside down.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE FUNCTIONING<br />
BUT NO ONE TAKING THE LEAD</h2>
<p>We are changing the system in order to change the habit of not speaking in the meetings. Everyone must speak the Lord&rsquo;s word. If we speak the Lord&rsquo;s word in the meetings and at home, the condition of the church will change for the better, and it will not be difficult for the church to spread and increase. Presently we rejoice when one person is saved and baptized, but when we all speak, we will not find it strange if one thousand people are baptized, because it will be a normal occurrence.</p>
<p>We are very happy when a few people are saved, because we do not speak, we do not have new ones for the increase of the church, and we are not spreading. If we all speak for the Lord and speak His word every day in our homes and in every place, people will be amazed at the kind of people we are, the number of new believers will increase, and we will spread. On the positive side, the change in the system is to cause everyone to function, and on the negative side, by changing the system, no particular person has to take the lead. Rather, everyone takes the lead.</p>
<p>We are not that bold when we preach the gospel. It seems as if we can only beg people to receive the Lord, and we are thankful when we are not opposed. When someone receives the gospel, we are in the third heaven. Not many among us can boldly preach the gospel to sinners and ask a new one to open his home immediately after he is saved in order to preach the gospel to others and to have home meetings.</p>
<p>We do not speak in this way, because we do not believe that a new one will open his home or that he can preach the gospel immediately after his salvation. We spend much energy to set up home meetings, but we do not have the faith to ask the new believers to open their homes. We also have the subconscious desire to be a leading one. We do not believe that others can take the lead, and we are not willing for them to take the lead. Instead, we want to take the lead. The ones who truly desire to take the lead among us are the co-workers. Wherever they go, they want to take the lead. The elders are the second group of people who like to take the lead. The leading ones in the service groups are a third group of people who like to take the lead. Whether they are leading ones in the cleaning service group or in teaching <em>Truth Lessons,</em> they like to be responsible to arrange things for others. This concept of taking the lead is a fallen concept that produced organized Christianity and gave rise to the clerical hierarchy of pastors, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</p>
<p>In changing the system, we want to overthrow the concept of taking the lead by allowing everyone to function. The elders and co-workers must be patterns. From now on we should not have leaders; we should only have patterns. The elders and co-workers must function as patterns to help the saints know how to advance.</p>
<p>For the past twenty or more years, the work in Taiwan has not spread very much. There has been no increase in the churches and the number of churches has not increased. There are only eighty localities in Taiwan. But in America more than eighty churches have been raised up over the past twenty years, and approximately twenty churches have been raised up in Canada. This means that more than one hundred churches have been raised up in North America. More than one hundred churches have been raised up in South America. There are also approximately one hundred churches in Europe, Africa, and Australia. Who took the lead to raise up these churches? Some people have written books to condemn me and say that I control people with an iron hand and that I am a dictator, a pope. They lift me up too high. I am more than eighty years old, and I have no way to even read all the letters I receive, much less use an iron fist to control people. I am not a pope, and I do not want to make myself a leader. I am simply a pattern to show people how they should function. I cannot control whether people do what I say. I teach the truth and write books. I only want people to be supplied in life and edified in the truth. Many of the letters I receive from around the world, especially those from America, say how much the writers have been helped by my books. This would not be the result if I was taking the lead as some people suggest.</p>
<p>My point is that we must all rise up, and everyone must speak. It does not matter if we say something wrong. The co-workers, elders, serving ones, and the teachers of <em>Truth Lessons</em> are not leaders. We do not have any leaders among us; at the most we have patterns, who direct the saints and help them take the proper path. For this reason, when an elder is serving, he should not serve by himself. Three to five people should serve with him, and he should teach them how to serve. After doing this a few times, the elder should take his hands off and let those who have learned by serving with him bear responsibility for the matter.</p>
<p>In 1946 the church in Nanking felt that the victory in the war created an opportunity for the work, and they invited me to visit them. In our first meeting I said that they should not expect me to work for them. I was there to discharge the burden within me. At the time I was caring for Nanking and serving in Shanghai. The church in Shanghai had not held meetings for several years because of the war. When the meetings in Shanghai were recovered, I spoke the same thing in Shanghai. I said that I had not come to work for them but to be a pattern by working with them and by teaching them how to serve. I also said that after I taught them, they would do everything by themselves.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the church in Taipei until today, nothing has been in my hands. The brothers can testify that I can leave Taipei at any time without the need to give anyone instructions because everything is in the brothers&rsquo; hands. The brothers from America can also testify that even though the meeting hall of the church in Anaheim is close to my home, the church in Anaheim is not in my pocket. I do not know how many meetings the church in Anaheim has every week or what they do in the meetings. All the service is under the care of the brothers. This is my testimony. I hope that all the co-workers and elders will have the concept that wherever they go, they are patterns, not leaders.</p>
<p>A few years ago I spoke with the co-workers and elders in the church in Taipei, and asked why they made the meeting hall look like a government building. This gives people the impression that they are in a government office when they go to see the elders. The brothers said that they did not intend to make the meeting hall look like a government office. However, this was the real situation. Some saints are afraid to knock on the door of the elders&rsquo; room because they feel as if they are visiting the president. This is intolerable. Once, a spiritual brother who loved the Lord visited a city in Europe. He was very famous, and everyone in the city wanted to see him. However, he avoided everyone and went to play with the children. When the people eventually found him, they were disappointed and thought that he was not spiritual. Actually, this brother was truly spiritual. If he had behaved as if he was the most spiritual man in Europe, he would not have been spiritual.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in order to take care of the meeting, the elders sit in the front row for the convenience of communicating with one another, but sitting in the front row should not become a rule. The saints should not think that the seats in the front are only for the responsible brothers. We must change this practice. The responsible brothers do not necessarily need to sit in the front. They can sit there for the convenience of making announcements, but to make this a special situation is the way of the Pharisees, who loved the place of honor at the dinners and the chief seats in the synagogues (Matt. 23:6). The Lord Jesus said that whoever wants to be great among us shall be our servant (v. 11; 20:26). Those who preach the word and administrate the churches should not act as the head. Whenever they act as the head, they annul the function of the other believers. Changing the system is to eliminate the habit of some being the head so that every brother and sister can rise up to speak for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">OPENING OUR HOMES FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>Even though the people of God in the Old Testament did not receive the grace that we receive, Joshua was able to say, &ldquo;As for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah&rdquo; (Josh. 24:15). Nothing gives us more blessing than opening our homes for the Lord. In the New Testament the couple Aquila and Priscilla is a sweet pattern. When they were in Rome, the church in Rome met in their home (Rom. 16:3-5), and when they were in Ephesus, the church in Ephesus met in their home (Acts 18:18-19; 1 Cor. 16:19). On the one hand, it is bothersome to a person to have meetings in his home. On the other hand, it is a great blessing.</p>
<p>As believers, it is reasonable for us to have meetings in our homes for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. A believer has no excuse for not opening his home for the Lord. Our homes should be full of the Lord&rsquo;s word. We should have not only the Bible but also our publications, and we should discuss the things of the Lord all day long.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING PROPER RECREATION</h2>
<p>In relation to man there is the principle that all our activities, including eating, drinking, sleeping, working, and resting, should be regulated. We need approximately three hours every day to eat three meals, eight hours to sleep, and eight hours to work. This is a total of nineteen hours, and this leaves five hours for recreation. God desires that man use these five hours to worship Him, pray to Him, speak about Him with believers and unbelievers, and sing hymns of praise. This is the best recreation.</p>
<p>Any other form of recreation will only produce sin. Going to nightclubs to eat, drink, and dance, or going to movies or concerts for recreation causes people to unconsciously fall into sin, because people in these places are loose and impure. The church life, however, leads people to Christ, and because He is pure, those who are under this atmosphere are spontaneously separated from sin.</p>
<p>The present cost of living in Taiwan is high, and many young couples must work to meet their financial needs. In spite of this, we can still separate at least two hours a day for the Lord. We can take some time in the morning to contact Him, and we can take some time in the evening to either attend a meeting or contact others. This is practical, and it is beneficial for our health.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING ANXIOUS FOR TOMORROW,<br />
BUT CASTING EVERYTHING ON THE LORD</h2>
<p>More than forty years ago I contracted tuberculosis. While I was sick, it was painful for me to see my children, because I did not know how I would care for them. I went to the Lord and asked Him to give me another fifteen years. At the time I was only thirty-nine years old. Today I still thank the Lord for giving me many more years. Matthew 6:34 says, &ldquo;Do not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.&rdquo; We should take care of what we need to take care of today. This is especially true of the young people. If you need to obtain an education, you should obtain it. In order to meet the Lord&rsquo;s need and to take care of yourself, you should study hard and do well in school. This is your responsibility. When you get a job, you should fulfill your obligations and build up your character. This is also your responsibility. In this way, you will not be worried about what to eat and what to wear. Do not think about how much money you will make or how much you can save. One war can devalue any currency and cause the money to amount to nothing.</p>
<p>We are not asking the brothers and sisters to live in poverty. We should simply take what the Lord has given us and use it properly for the Lord. Concerning the principle of giving, in the Old Testament there were tithes. The children of Israel offered the Lord ten percent of what they received, and the rest of what they received was for their use. God established this so that His children could live, and His work and kingdom would have a future.</p>
<p>Taiwan has a population of almost twenty million, transportation and housing are convenient, and food is available. It is a shame that we have not spread the gospel. Therefore, we must produce full-time serving ones. Out of every twenty saints there should be one full-time serving one. In other words, nineteen working saints should support the needs of a full-time serving one. Some full-time serving ones have been forced to get a job because they are not receiving enough financial support to meet the needs of their family. This shows a lack among us. We need to live for the Lord, and we should not waste any money. Even though we do not need to be too frugal, and we should take care of the needs of our family, we must still offer our money to the Lord for His use. This is what it means to be faithful to the Lord, and it is the only way to be right with Him.</p>
<p>Since we love the Lord, we should not fear consecrating everything we have to Him. I can testify that the seed of a righteous man does not need to seek bread (Psa. 37:25). We have seen many who love the Lord and were blessed by Him. May we all be at peace. If a young person has the burden to serve full time, he should boldly become a full-timer without the fear of going hungry. He should give his time, home, and money to the Lord. The Lord will take care of us. The Lord wants us to be well educated. He also wants our second generation to receive a good education so that they can be healthy and serve Him.</p>
<p>We should thank God that even though Taiwan is small, it has a strong economy. The Lord in His mercy has made us rich. However, these riches are not for us to spend on ourselves without restriction; rather, they are for us to use in an appropriate way, without being excessive. Then we will have money for the Lord&rsquo;s use. We must do our best to preach the gospel, open our homes for meetings, and produce full-time serving ones who will work for the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE COMMUNITY WORK AND<br />
THE BUILDING OF A LARGE MEETING HALL</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE SPEAKING, NO ONE BEING THE HEAD,<br />
AND MEETING IN EVERY HOME</h2>
<p>The three important matters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today are begetting, nourishing, and teaching. There is also an urgent need for us to practice three things: everyone speaking, no one being the head, and having a meeting in every home. Some people might say that everyone speaks, and under normal circumstances everyone can speak; however, in the meetings very few people speak. Therefore, we must stand against this situation and encourage everyone to speak in the meetings.</p>
<p>In the natural man everyone likes to be the head. This can be seen even among children; the oldest child in a family always wants to be the head. However, in our service to the Lord, we must stand against the natural man. No one should be the head. There is only one person who is the Head; we have only one Head. The Chinese character for <em>big</em> or <em>great</em> is composed of <em>one</em> and <em>man.</em> Only one man, the Lord Jesus, is great. Apart from Him, no one is great.</p>
<p>We also need meetings in every home. Human beings are social; we like to contact one another. I like to go to your home, and you like to come to my home. However, when it is related to the Lord, very few people want to open their homes and invite people. The three poisons of no one speaking, everyone being the head, and homes without meetings are in us from degraded Christianity.</p>
<p>God wants all His people to be prophets (Num. 11:29). The apostle Paul says that we can all prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:31). This is the desire of God&rsquo;s heart. In Matthew 20 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave&rdquo; (v. 27). Acts shows that the early believers opened their homes and met from house to house immediately after they were saved (2:46).</p>
<p>In Taipei there are presently three to four thousand saints who meet regularly and participate in the activities of the church. According to our estimate there are about one thousand households. What would the situation be if these four thousand saints spoke concerning God, the Lord Jesus, and the divine life every day? What would the situation be if they spoke the gospel and the truth every day? If they opened their homes and had a meeting one evening a week for one year, our numbers would double; we would increase from four thousand people to eight thousand people and from one thousand households to two thousand households. In the second year we could increase to twelve thousand people. Those who are saved in the homes will be remaining fruit. Furthermore, they will do the same things that we do because children usually imitate their parents. If we all speak, no one can be the head, and we will open our homes. Then the ones we lead to salvation will be the same as we. In two years there could be twelve thousand people who practice these three things. This would be glorious.</p>
<p>Those in Christianity and even we are dead because no one speaks in the meetings, everyone wants to be the head, and no one opens his home for meetings. May the Lord show us that we must overturn the habits of not speaking and not opening our homes, and we must hate being the head. If we are such people, those whom we lead to salvation will also be like this. They will open their homes, speak in the meetings, and not want to be the head. By diligently practicing these three things, we will bring in a revival to the island of Taiwan. This is the way to gospelize Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL WORK</h2>
<p>Some young brothers and sisters are already going out to the new communities to preach the gospel from door to door, and the results have been very good. Almost every door they knocked on was open to them. People opened their doors to welcome them, and those who received them were blessed with the gospel. Many people invited them to return for a second visit. These homes are for preaching the gospel. This is marvelous. From the time we began preaching the gospel in mainland China, we have not encountered a situation like this. It is truly wonderful.</p>
<p>If we all speak for the Lord, no one can be the head to restrict, rule over, hinder, or control the other saints, and if we are freed from bondage to open our homes for meetings, our relatives, friends, and neighbors will be saved. Before we read the Bible with people or meet with them in our homes, we need to be prepared so that we can lead them to Christ. The Chinese people like to read Proverbs because it is full of wise sayings. Sixty years ago I also liked to read Proverbs, but the more I studied the Bible, the deeper I entered into God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It is easy for a new believer to appreciate Proverbs. Reading Proverbs can be compared to serving people appetizers to whet their appetite. Proverbs whets the appetite. For example, Proverbs 10:19 says, &ldquo;When there are many words transgression does not cease, / But he who restrains his lips is prudent.&rdquo; When a person hears these words, he will feel that the Bible is a superior book, regardless of his religious background.</p>
<p>There was a co-worker who was two years older than I. He contracted tuberculosis forty years ago at the same time that I did. Our sicknesses were approximately the same in severity, but he went to be with the Lord. I often remember him because we were very close and in one accord. He was from Manchuria, and before his salvation he was zealous for politics. He even contributed most of the wealth that he had inherited to political causes. He also despised Christianity because he thought it was a Western religion and a form of imperialism. He did not believe in anything and was not superstitious. One day he stopped by a small temple on a mountain. In the temple there was a large Bible on the offering table that was opened to Psalm 1. He read verses 1 and 2: &ldquo;Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners, / Nor sit in the seat of mockers; / Rather his delight is in the law of Jehovah, / And in His law he meditates by day and by night.&rdquo; He was drawn to these words and read the rest of the psalm, thinking that the Bible was better than he expected. The more he read, the more he liked it. The words of the Bible touched him, and the Holy Spirit worked within him. Even though no one preached the gospel to him, he repented and began confessing his sins in tears. After his salvation his only desire was to preach the Lord Jesus. I met him after his salvation, and we served the Lord together.</p>
<p>We should all spend time to read the Bible so that our speaking is simple and clear when we preach the gospel. Then it will not be difficult for others to understand us. When we first speak to people, we should not speak about Abraham begetting Isaac and Isaac begetting Jacob or about the prophecy of the seventy weeks. Although we may consider these to be interesting topics, the people we are speaking to will not understand us. We need to read through the Bible several times. The Bible is a treasure store that contains many riches. We also should not speak to people about insignificant matters; rather, we should take the Bible with us and speak its precious words to people everywhere. We should speak what people need to hear.</p>
<p>A mother may speak with us about the problems she has with her children. We can read Mark 10:14 with her, which says, &ldquo;Allow the little children to come to Me.&rdquo; All mothers like to hear verses like this. We can also speak of how the Lord blessed the little children. Because mothers love their children, when we speak in this way, we touch their hearts. We can then preach the gospel by explaining that only the Lord Jesus can help her children; she has no way to help them. The Lord Jesus loves little children.</p>
<p>It is very convenient to preach the gospel in the communities because more than twenty households live in one apartment building. We can take the elevator to their doorsteps. I heard that a Christian group in Seoul, Korea, trains its members to contact people for the gospel. There are many housewives who stay at home with little children in Seoul. When these housewives buy their groceries, they carry their child in one arm and their groceries in the other. They need someone to help them. This Christian group trains its members to wait by the elevator in the apartment buildings and help the housewives carry their groceries into the elevator and to their front door while conversing with them. As a result the housewives invite the believers in for a cup of tea, and the gospel is preached to them. This is a good way to contact people.</p>
<p>If we practice, it will not be difficult to contact people for the gospel. There are over sixty new residential communities being developed within the city limits of Taipei. Young working couples who recently graduated from college live in these communities. Some denominations are already working in these communities, and there are eighty to one hundred people in their meetings. Hence, we should pay attention to the gospel work in these communities. Acts 1:8 says, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; Taipei is our Jerusalem. We must preach the gospel to every part of this city. The first step in gospelizing Taiwan is to gospelize the city of Taipei, and the best way to gospelize Taipei is to labor in the communities. If we labor in the communities, the gospel will spread quickly.</p><h2 class="head1">THE COOPERATION OF THE FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>We have brothers and sisters in almost every community in Taipei. The most effective way is for the full-time trainees to coordinate with these brothers and sisters and go with them to knock on doors and visit people. We need to receive a burden to pray for this. There are many communities in Taipei that are equivalent to a village. It is worthwhile for us to labor in these communities. If one thousand full-time brothers and sisters coordinate with the saints living in the communities, the result will be glorious. This requires our prayer, and it requires all the brothers and sisters to pick up the burden and to spend their money and energy on this. The saints can go out in the gospel, and they can also support the full-time brothers and sisters so that the full-time serving ones can offer all their time.</p>
<p>The church is like an army fighting for the kingdom of God on the earth; therefore, we must give our all&mdash;our strength, time, and money&mdash;for God&rsquo;s interest on the earth. This does not mean that we should not take care of our practical needs. Rather, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake we should live a normal life and take care of the education of our children. If the Lord gives us any surplus, we should refuse to spend it on ourselves. We should give the surplus to the Lord. If we are willing to do this, it will be very easy to gospelize Taiwan. This will bring a great blessing to our society and to our country.</p>
<p>Idols are prevalent in Taiwan, and crime has increased. These conditions indicate that there is a desperate need for the gospel. We must spread the preaching of the gospel because we live in this age and we have received a burden from the Lord to spread His recovery. The last chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, which is a book on the gospel of the kingdom, speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s ultimate commission. In this chapter the Lord charges us to go and disciple all the nations because He has received all authority in heaven and on earth (28:18-19). We need to go so that the Gentiles can become not only believers but also the Lord&rsquo;s disciples, that is, those who spread the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom. We must go and baptize people into the Triune God. This is the commission that the Lord gave us, and we must receive it.</p>
<p>We are now in the Lord&rsquo;s particular move in Taiwan. He has opened a wide door for the spread of the churches. We have a good environment, so we should give ourselves and take advantage of this opportunity. We need to be mobilized and give ourselves to the Lord. We should give Him our heart, strength, money, family, and children. If we do this, we will see a glorious situation in the gospelization of Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
A LARGE MEETING HALL</h2>
<p>We have been progressing positively with respect to acquiring a large meeting hall in Linkou. The land we purchased is on a hillside, and the government has many regulations concerning the development of hillside property. These regulations do not depend on whether the property is forestland or farmland. Therefore, we must go through the proper procedures and apply for a permit to develop the land.</p>
<p>Some saints asked why we need a large meeting hall when we are promoting the burden for the small groups and home meetings. The principle in the Bible shows that we need both the big meetings and the small meetings. These meetings can be compared to the two wings of a bird or an airplane. The big meetings are one wing, and the small meetings are the other wing. Based on the experience we gained this year, we know that even though there are many activities in the small meetings, we still need the strengthening from the big meetings. For this reason, we need a large meeting hall so that the saints from localities such as Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung can gather together.</p>
<p>Even though there are small group meetings all over the city of Taipei, we still need a big meeting for everyone to attend at least once a month and a larger meeting every six months. In the future we hope to have two thousand five hundred full-time brothers and sisters being trained each term. The place where they can meet and have training classes is a problem. Presently we are unable to receive the saints from overseas into the training, because of the limitations in our capacity. If we have a place with a dormitory and a dining hall, we can accept the saints from abroad to the training. This would save both time and effort.</p>
<p>Taipei is a large city in the Far East. It is a highly industrialized and commercial city, and the number of people living in the communities is steadily increasing. This makes Taipei a large fishing pond; it is one of the best places for preaching the gospel. Therefore, we need to pay attention to the development of our work and labor in one accord for the building of the big meeting hall. At the same time we should pay attention to the spread of the work. We should seriously consider these things before the Lord, and we should look to Him that the work in these two areas would proceed simultaneously. We should not stop the work in the communities in order to focus on the development of the large meeting hall. If we do this, we will suffer loss. We must work toward the building of the large meeting hall at Linkou and, at the same time, put our strength, time, and money into developing the work in the communities.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PROVISION IN FINANCES</h2>
<p>We need to exercise faith toward the Lord, and look to Him for His blessing and His leading. We do not discuss money when someone is sent out for the work. This is an established practice among us. It is wrong for a person to think that because the work sends him out, it will also give him a specific amount of money. This is not our practice. When we first came to Taiwan, the work did not arrange for any money to be given to me. The only one who supplied me was my senior co-worker, Brother Watchman Nee. In 1933 when I was struggling with the decision of leaving my job and serving the Lord full time, Brother Nee was returning to China on a ship in the Mediterranean Sea, and he wrote me a letter confirming my decision to serve the Lord. When I received the letter, I was surprised, and I felt it was from the Lord; hence, I made a special trip to Shanghai to visit him. He asked me to stay in Shanghai for three or four months. Once during that time, he came to the place where I was staying and said, &ldquo;Brother Witness, the Lord has given this for your use.&rdquo; He then left me an envelope. That was the first time that he supplied me financially, and it is deeply engraved on my heart.</p>
<p>Later when he took the lead in the work to send me to Taiwan, in either April or May of 1949, he personally gave me three hundred U.S. dollars. That was how I came to Taiwan. My household consisted of twelve people: my wife and I, our eight children, and two helpers whom we could not leave behind. We came as a household of twelve people and lived in a Japanese style house that was about three hundred square feet.</p>
<p>At that time most of the brothers and sisters who came from mainland China fled to Taiwan with the government. Few people were wealthy. It was at this time that two Chinese brothers from Manila came to Taiwan and saw the needs of the work. This was of the Lord. They bought a piece of land and gave it to the church. This is part of the land on which hall one of the church in Taipei stands. They also built a small meeting hall on the land, and we began to meet in it.</p>
<p>After the work began on August 1, 1949, it spread rapidly, and the meeting hall was no longer adequate. Behind the meeting hall was a piece of land that had only the concrete foundations of houses that were bombed during the war. A Taiwanese man was using the land to grow vegetables. We felt to buy his rights to the land, and he agreed to sell his rights to us for almost two hundred U.S. dollars. We then went to the Bureau of National Assets for the parcel number of the land and to find out if it had been sold to anyone. It had not been sold, so we immediately applied to buy the land. In those days land was very cheap, and we purchased it for less than one thousand U.S. dollars. This is the land on which hall one stands.</p>
<p>In November 1950 I went to the Philippines to begin the work there, and I stayed there for five and a half months. As I was about to leave the saints, a brother who was a businessman made an appointment and met with me. He said that he would cover all the expenses for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan, regardless of how much it was. Even though I said that we never tell people how much money the work needs, he insisted that I was not telling him; rather, it was he who was asking me to please let him know how much was needed. From that time onward, for a period of eleven years, this brother bore the financial responsibility for the work in Taiwan. The land for most of the meeting halls in Taiwan was purchased during those years. This was the Lord&rsquo;s provision.</p>
<p>The Lord has blessed us not only in relation to our numbers and the work; He has also blessed us in material things. We should not go by what we see; we must be determined to do whatever the Lord wants us to do.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S MONETARY BLESSING</h2>
<p>When I went to America to begin the work there, I was empty-handed, just as I was when I came to Taiwan. At the time I was still responsible for the monthly living expenses of several co-workers in Taiwan. The Lord began the work in America, and He is still blessing it to this day. We obtained a large meeting hall in Anaheim, California, and another one in Irving, Texas. These two meeting halls were given to us by the Lord. I am fellowshipping these matters because I want everyone to believe that the Lord blesses His work.</p>
<p>The publication work of the ministry office is taken care of at three stations. One station is in Anaheim, the second station is our printing section in Irving, and the third station is the Taiwan Gospel Book Room in Taipei. There are more than sixty full-time serving ones in these three places. There are more than twice that number of volunteers who come in to work; there are more than one hundred twenty volunteers. All of this has been accomplished by the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING FAITHFUL IN MATERIAL OFFERINGS<br />
TO THE LORD AND CARING FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S NEED</h2>
<p>Even though the Linkou project will require several million Taiwan dollars, we should not put all our money into this project and neglect the development of the work in the communities. This is wrong. We must labor simultaneously in both areas. The brothers and sisters should labor before the Lord and learn how to use their money so that by faithfully giving, they can gradually attain the amount they have pledged to the Lord. We should not forget the amount of our pledge, and we should not take money from that amount to use for other purposes.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters will ask whether the cost for purchasing the land at Linkou, developing the plans, and constructing the hall exceeds our original budget. This may be true, but we believe that the churches around the world will contribute to this project. We believe that when the offerings of the overseas churches are added to the offerings of the churches in Taiwan, the lack will be taken care of. This will not be a problem. We must be faithful to fulfill the offering we pledged to the Lord. As long as the brothers and sisters faithfully make their offerings, according to their vow to the Lord, the completion of the large meeting hall will not be a heavy burden. We believe that the Lord will continue to bless us.</p>
<p>Related to the spread of the community work, the brothers and sisters still need to do their best before the Lord to support the needs of the work. Then the full-time brothers and sisters will be adequately supported and will have a stable living without anxieties. This will enable them to work in peace. If the full-time saints are hindered financially, it will affect the brothers and sisters who want to go full time in the future. They will lack the boldness to give themselves. Thus, we must take good care of the present full-timers so that future full-timers will be at peace. This does not mean that the full-timers do not have faith, but they need to take care of their families. The purpose of this fellowship is not to deprive the brothers and sisters of food and clothing. Rather, it is for them to live a normal life and take care of their children&rsquo;s education but not spend even one penny on unnecessary items. May the Lord&rsquo;s blood cover me; this is what I practice. I buy only the clothes and items that I need, and I make a budget so that any surplus can be used for the Lord. If we would all practice this, the Lord&rsquo;s blessing would be upon us.</p>
<p>According to the experience of the believers and the promises in the Bible, if we are faithful to the Lord, He will open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings upon us. Malachi 3:10 says, &ldquo;Bring the whole tithe to the storehouse that there may be food in My house; and prove Me, if you will, by this, says Jehovah of hosts, whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it.&rdquo; When this word was spoken, there were many defeated ones among the Israelites, which resulted in the situation recorded in the book of Haggai: &ldquo;You have sown much, but you bring in little; you eat, but there is no satisfaction; you drink, but there is no being filled with drink; you dress yourselves, but there is no warmth in doing so; and he who earns wages, earns wages to put them into a bag with holes&rdquo; (1:6). We should believe that our Lord is real and living and that He is faithful. All His words in the Bible are trustworthy. For the past sixty years I have been following Him, relying on Him, and believing Him; hence, I can testify to you that I have seen His multifarious riches manifested in our faithfulness. Brothers and sisters, it is a blessing and a glory for us to be willing to see the Lord&rsquo;s need and to give our all for His use.</p>
<p>We should consider what would happen if we all consecrated everything we have for the Lord&rsquo;s use. Gradually, three thousand, four thousand, and even ten thousand people would be saved. Seeing the fruit of our material offerings would make us joyful. In Luke 16:9 the Lord said, &ldquo;Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.&rdquo; Today we are happy when we see people being saved, and when we enter the kingdom, there will be people welcoming us. I believe that we will be surprised to see those who will welcome us. They will say to us, &ldquo;The money you gave provided the way for me to be saved.&rdquo; We truly believe that this will happen; otherwise, the Lord would not have spoken this word. We should all believe this word. The Lord makes the way, and He gives the blessing.</p>
<p>It is necessary for us to complete the large meeting facility. After the meeting facility is completed, we will discover that it does not fully meet our need. Therefore, we will need more large stations in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hualien, and Taitung to meet the need of spreading the work to the entire island. This is not a small thing. We must also proceed with the development of the community work in the city of Taipei. We must take care of these three things.</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord, You have heard our fellowship. We believe that it is from You, and we ask You to come in and accomplish it. Bless the brothers and sisters for the sake of these things. Bless their homes, their children, and their jobs so that they can give themselves, their households, their time, and their money. Lord, for the sake of the increase and spread of the churches, bless this country, our society, and the development of this island. Glorify Your name. The day of Your coming is near. We ask You to gospelize, truthize, and churchize Taiwan so that Taiwan can become an island that is full of Your testimony. May all the glory be to the Triune God. Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM<br />
IN THE WHOLE INHABITED EARTH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:14; 28:18-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE THREE GREAT ASSETS OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We have three great assets in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which no other Christian group has. We have the truth, we have churches all over the entire earth, and we can produce full-time serving ones. From 1922 to 1984 the Lord released more truths among us than among any other Christian group throughout history. From 1974 to 1984 we expounded the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. These messages are printed in more than one thousand Life-study messages. These truths are also in the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. We inherited most of these truths from the believers who went before us, beginning with the church fathers in the first century to those in the Brethren assemblies in the last century. We did not invent these truths. Our understanding of the Bible is a combination of the light the church has received from the Lord over the past two thousand years and the revelation we have received from the Lord. For example, none of the believers who went before us clearly expounded the truth concerning the New Jerusalem, but in the book <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</em> we thoroughly and clearly expound the truth concerning the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A theological seminary in the Far East put out a publication in which they said that for the past forty years the local churches have influenced the exposition of the Bible among the Chinese. This is the situation in the Far East and in the West. There are many different Christian groups and broadcasters in America who use our publications as material for preaching. Christians cannot deny that during the past sixty years God has commissioned us with the truth. Therefore, the truth is our first asset.</p>
<p>The churches that have spread over the six continents are our second asset. In a little over twenty years more than three hundred churches were raised up in the West. This was not the work of man. Nearly eighty percent of these churches were raised up through reading our publications. At present there are about one hundred churches in the United States and Canada, approximately one hundred churches in South America, Central America, and Mexico, and about one hundred churches in Europe, Africa, and Australia. These are the three hundred churches that are in the Western hemisphere. There are more than three hundred churches in the Eastern hemisphere. From Japan and South Korea in the north to Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the south, there are one hundred churches. There are eighty churches in Taiwan, and there are one hundred twenty churches on both the northern and southern islands of the Philippines. Therefore, there is a total of six hundred churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in more than thirty different countries on the earth. No other Christian group has spread throughout the entire globe as the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread.</p>
<p>The ability to produce full-time serving ones is our third asset. There is no place on the earth that can compare to Taiwan in relation to producing full-time serving ones. In Taiwan transportation and communication are developed, education is widespread, public security is good, and the economy is well developed. These factors create the best situation for us to produce full-time serving ones. If we sent one thousand full-time brothers and sisters to South America, they would not meet the need; neither would three to five hundred full-time serving ones meet the need in Africa. Of course, the ones going to South America would need to speak Spanish, and the ones going to Africa would need to speak English. Taiwan needs to produce five hundred full-timers every year, and they must be fluent in foreign languages. We must gospelize Taiwan within the next five years and then go abroad to spread the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM<br />
TO THE WHOLE INHABITED EARTH</h2>
<p>In the upcoming full-time training the saints will be trained in foreign languages. We need to strengthen the trainees in their ability to speak foreign languages, and we must teach them how to preach the gospel, that is, how to visit people from house to house in order to lead people to salvation. We must also teach the trainees how to establish churches. After the gospelization of Taiwan we will send a group of trainees abroad. They will go to Latin America, Indonesia, and Africa. Then they will learn Arabic in order to go to the Arabic-speaking world.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:14 says, &ldquo;This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth.&rdquo; The Gospel of Matthew is a book on the kingdom. It presents the gospel of the kingdom, which is different from the gospel of the forgiveness of sins presented in Mark and Luke. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24:14, the gospel of the kingdom must be preached wherever there are people. At the end of the Gospel of Matthew the Lord said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&rdquo; (28:18-20). This word means that the Lord wants us to go and make all the nations His disciples.</p>
<p>The end of the Gospel of Mark says, &ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation&rdquo; (16:15). The end of the Gospel of Luke says, &ldquo;That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations&rdquo; (24:47). The gospel referred to in these two portions is the general gospel. Only the gospel referred to in Matthew is the gospel of the kingdom. After the Lord rose from the dead, all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him. Therefore, He wants us to establish His kingdom by discipling all the nations. He does not merely want us to go out and gain believers, but even more, He wants us to go out and gain disciples. Disciples are those who are trained and who live the kingdom life.</p>
<p>Our authority to announce the gospel of the kingdom depends on our knowledge of the truth. Many of our publications are concerning the truth of the kingdom presented in Matthew and the truth of the divine life presented in John. Paul also spoke of the kingdom and of life, because he considered the church to be the kingdom. Our commission is to go and preach the gospel of the kingdom to every part of the inhabited earth and to cause every believer to become a disciple of the kingdom. In this last age the Lord has given us the highest and the final truths. This is His sovereign arrangement. In the past missionaries from different countries traveled great distances across the oceans to preach the gospel in China. Now Chinese &ldquo;missionaries&rdquo; must go to the different countries to preach the truth. They will not go as pioneers; rather, they will go to fight the battle with the truth, to bring the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR HUMAN RESOURCES</h2>
<p>After we gospelize Taiwan, every town and village will have churches with <em>Truth Lessons</em> classes. This will be a glorious sight. Our current practice is to build up the church life in the homes; however, we still need a large meeting hall. The large meeting hall in Linkou will not only be a meeting place for the saints; it can also be a training center. The training will be held every year, and there will constantly be new people coming through it. Soon people from around the world will come to attend the training; therefore, we will need to prepare two thousand beds.</p>
<p>Even though every aspect of society in Taiwan is good, it is not sufficiently ethical or moral. The newspaper contains many articles concerning arson, murder, assault, and robbery. This means that there is not enough truth in this land and that there is a lack of the gospel of the kingdom. Hence, we need to bear the burden to gospelize the island of Taiwan, after which we must go to every country and gospelize the entire earth. Do not think that this is merely a dream; this can be put into practice. If we have one thousand people today who are equipped with the truth and have a foundation in foreign languages, we could send them out immediately. We receive phone calls from South America, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and many other places, saying, &ldquo;Please send us someone; we need help.&rdquo; There are more than ten countries in South America that are open to us. They receive the Life-study messages as if they are receiving a treasure. We cannot translate the publications fast enough to meet their needs. Every place needs the truth. Therefore, in the future it will not be sufficient to send out only the publications to spread the work. We must also send out people. After the full-time brothers and sisters pass through the training in the truth, receive experiences in serving the Lord, and learn some foreign languages, they will go and gospelize the world. This is not idle speculation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR FINANCIAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>There are many brothers and sisters in Taipei who love the Lord but whose circumstances do not allow them to serve full time. However, they can give their money and become money-supplying full-timers. Some saints will preach the gospel and do the Lord&rsquo;s work full time; other saints are in the church life and earn money for the use of the Lord&rsquo;s work. The only difference between these two types of full-time serving ones is that some are full time with their time, and others are full time with their money. The saints who cannot give their time to serve the Lord can be money-supplying full-timers. According to this understanding, all the brothers and sisters are full-timers.</p>
<p>We need a budget for any move we make. Most of the saints who answered the Lord&rsquo;s call to serve full time are recent college graduates. Thus, during their time of training and after they are trained and enter into the Lord&rsquo;s work, the churches will need to bear the burden of their monthly support. Their support will not be a small amount. Our goal is to take care of the full-time serving ones and then build the large meeting hall. I have full assurance concerning our financial budget. Initially we said that of the saints who regularly attend meetings, one in every twenty should serve full time. In other words, nineteen saints should support one full-time serving one. There are 42,000 brothers and sisters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery on the island of Taiwan, and approximately 18,000 of them attend the meetings. If we calculate one-twentieth of those who attend the meetings, there should be nine hundred full-time serving ones. It is possible for the number of saints in the meetings to reach 20,000 by 1988. This means that there can be one thousand full-time serving ones. Hence, it will not be difficult for us to obtain the human and financial resources needed to gospelize Taiwan.</p>
<p>There are two things that we need to consider. We need to consider who is willing to serve the Lord full time and whether the brothers and sisters are faithful in their material offerings. According to our present situation, it will be easy for us to produce one thousand full-time serving ones by 1988 if the brothers and sisters give one tenth of their income for this. The building of the large meeting hall is not only for the churches in Taiwan; it is also for the churches around the world. In these next few years the brothers and sisters should do their best to offer money for the building of a large meeting hall. Since we agree with the present way that we are taking, we must give our offerings according to the ability the Lord has given us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S BLESSING AND THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>I believe that the Lord will bless this island and that this move will bring in a further blessing. The Lord&rsquo;s blessing is the basis for our consecration. If the Lord does not bless us, we have nothing to offer Him. There are three great assets in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery: the truth, the churches throughout the earth, and the base for producing one thousand full-time serving ones. The human and financial resources are being produced in Taiwan. Because of the presence of the churches in Taiwan, God is taking care of His testimony, and He is blessing this country. We are in the last days of this age, but the gospel that has been preached over the earth is the general gospel, not the gospel of the kingdom. God has given us the responsibility to preach the gospel of the kingdom, and He wants us to take the gospel of the kingdom to North and South America, to Africa, to Australia, and to the whole inhabited earth.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago I went to America by myself. At the time I was almost sixty years old. I still remember the first conference we held on &ldquo;The All-inclusive Christ.&rdquo; In this conference I spoke for ten days on the three verses of Deuteronomy 8:7-9. This conference surprised the pastors and professors who were there. They had never studied or even heard the truth that was released in that conference. I hope that when those who are sent out to preach the gospel of the kingdom speak, the local people will marvel and say, &ldquo;Where did these people learn such truths?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The move to gospelize Taiwan has begun. The full-time brothers and sisters will go out in groups to every part of the island, and they will leave on the same day. This will be very impressive. They will move forward quickly. The present situation does not allow us to advance slowly. Most armies send supplies to a place before they send the troops; hence, I hope that the brothers and sisters are able to match the Lord&rsquo;s leading in their material offerings. The brothers and sisters who are trainees should be in one accord and care for one another while they are in the training. They must also learn to be frugal and show mutual concern by taking care of their necessities and giving the surplus to others. May the working saints do their best to give in order to cooperate with the church and to accomplish the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW WAY BEING A WAY OF BLESSING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BURDEN IN CHANGING OUR WAY</h2>
<p>Based on our observations over the past few years, we have a heavy burden and feel that we must change our way. We need a new beginning. There is no doubt that God, the Bible, the truth, and salvation do not and cannot change. No one can change the fact that God created the earth. Man can go to the moon, but he cannot change the moon, nor can he change the earth. However, man&rsquo;s activities change, and his method of working and the tools he uses to work are constantly changing. Over the past six thousand years the methods used by human beings for transportation have continually improved. These improvements are evident to everyone.</p>
<p>In the church life, however, there has not been much improvement in the way we meet, preach the gospel, serve, and shepherd the brothers and sisters, even though there are many things that can be improved and need to be changed. Twenty years ago factories, commerce, and methods of communication were outdated in Taiwan, but Taiwan&rsquo;s present advancement in technology is recognized all over the world. Taiwan has improved to the extent that it is considered modern. In the same way the church life should advance. This does not mean that we change the truth or salvation but that we must improve the church life. The Bible is unique, but we should consider the way we read and teach the Bible. According to our practice of the new way, we established home meetings for nourishing new believers. However, we need to research the best way to carry out the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING <em>LIFE LESSONS</em></h2>
<p>In our research to find the best way to nourish the new believers, we have tried two ways. We first tried using the Life-study messages. I spent one week with the elders in America to present the crucial points in each of Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles. This was to help them study the Life-studies. The elders were happy to receive the help, but they were unable to use the Life-studies to nourish the new believers. The problem was not with the material; rather, we did not know how to use the material. Therefore, we are now using another way. We are teaching <em>Life Lessons,</em> which consists of four volumes with twelve lessons in each volume. This is a total of forty-eight lessons. Using <em>Life Lessons</em> has been successful.</p>
<p>In the past the full-time trainees suffered when they went to nourish the new ones in their homes because they did not know what to say. Before we began the new way, the brothers who minister the word had a difficult time, and they dreaded Lord&rsquo;s Day morning because they were responsible to speak. Despite our numerous publications, it was difficult for them to select a topic to speak on. If their messages were shallow, many saints would not want to listen. If their messages were deep, no one would receive their speaking. The main requirement in leading a meeting is the Spirit and the Word. If we have the Spirit without the Word, the meeting will be empty, and if we have the Word without the Spirit, the meeting will be dead. We need both the Spirit and the Word. This is not easy. Should the topic of a good message be the heavens or the earth? Should it be the Lord Jesus or the Spirit? Should it be the church or the cross? Or should it be justification or salvation? It is difficult to find an appropriate topic.</p>
<p>For this reason, we put much consideration into the writing of <em>Life Lessons.</em> The first volume begins with the assurance of salvation and ends with knowing the church. In other words, it leads a new believer from being assured of his salvation to knowing the church. This volume also includes household salvation, clearance of the past, prayer, reading the Bible, knowing the true God, knowing Christ, knowing the Holy Spirit, and knowing the cross of Christ. The topics in this volume can be compared to a staircase because they lead a person step by step to know five great truths: the Bible, God, Christ, the Spirit, and the church. This is the content of the first volume.</p>
<p>Volume 1 ends with a lesson on knowing the church, and volume 2 begins with the negative matter of knowing the sects. The result of a person knowing the sects is that he desires to meet. Therefore, the second lesson is on meetings. The most important meeting is the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting in which we break bread to remember the Lord. After the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting there is a lesson on consecration. When a person is consecrated, he wants to serve the Lord, but because he is empty, he does not have the strength. He needs the inward and outward filling of the Holy Spirit. After being filled inwardly and outwardly with the Holy Spirit, he can preach the gospel and serve the Lord. When he preaches the gospel and serves the Lord, he sees the financial needs and participates in material offerings. This is the content of the second volume.</p>
<p>The third volume is somewhat deeper. It begins with being transferred into Christ, that is, being transferred out of Adam into Christ. Then it speaks of being joined to Christ, abiding in Christ, experiencing Christ, taking Christ as everything, becoming one spirit with the Lord, living in the fellowship of life, obeying the sense of life, obeying the teaching of the anointing, walking according to the spirit, and awaiting the Lord&rsquo;s coming. The last lesson is on being raptured to meet the Lord. The third volume begins with being transferred into Christ and ends with being raptured to meet the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus, volumes 1 through 3 of <em>Life Lessons</em> cover the entire Christian life. The fourth volume then gives a brief presentation of every aspect of God&rsquo;s full salvation. It begins with the way to enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation through repenting, believing, and being baptized. Then it presents the contents of salvation: forgiveness of sins, cleansing of sins, propitiation, reconciliation, sanctification, justification, regeneration, renewing, transformation, maturity, conformation, and glorification. These lessons contain all the stages of salvation from believing to glorification.</p><h2 class="head1">HOW TO USE <em>LIFE LESSONS</em></h2>
<p>When we go to the home meetings, we should not merely exchange greetings. In every meeting we should use the <em>Life Lessons</em> to inject the new ones with life. Whenever we go to a home meeting, we are &ldquo;doctors&rdquo; making house calls to give injections. We have forty-eight different medications, or nutrients, with which we inject the new ones. In the meeting we obtain a diagnosis based on their need, and we give them an injection of the nutrients that they are lacking. If they are lacking vitamin C, we give them vitamin C. After twenty minutes we may give them an injection of vitamin B. Then our time with them will not be a waste.</p>
<p>In every meeting we should inject the new ones with nutrients when we speak with them, pray with them, and pray-read with them. If we lead the new ones to read one lesson a week, we can read through all forty-eight lessons in one year. However, because every lesson has many points, we should not read through the lessons quickly. We should give the new ones an injection point by point. We may even need to read one topic two or three times. If we read the lessons quickly, the new ones will not be able to absorb the points. If we take the way of reading the lessons slowly, we may need a year and a half or even two years to read all the lessons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO BASIC STEPS IN PRACTICING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>When we announced the change in system in October 1984, we said that even though the vision concerning changing the system is clear and we know how to take this way, this is still a new way. In other words, this is our first time to take this way. Therefore, we are still researching, even though we are practicing the new way. We first discovered the way to knock on doors. Then we discovered the way to have home meetings. These are the two most basic steps in practicing the new way.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei is the largest church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is also the most stable church. It has a history of more than thirty years. However, during the past ten to twenty years our condition has gradually declined to the extent that we are maintaining the status quo, but we are not spreading or increasing. Our numbers have remained almost the same for ten to twenty years. In 1961 the church in Taipei had more than twenty thousand information cards. This was the number of brothers and sisters in the church. Of this number four to five thousand people were regularly in the meetings. Twenty-three years later, in 1984, the number of people in the church in Taipei had still not increased. Moreover, all the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery seemed to be in the same condition; they were neither increasing nor spreading. We lacked the increase in numbers and the spread of the church life to new localities. This is the reason that we felt the need to change the system in order to break through our condition of not doing business for the Lord (Luke 19:13).</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that during these twenty-three years no corrupt situation was manifested among us. The co-workers and the elders are holding to truth and pursuing life; hence, there is no corruption in the churches. In spite of this the churches are not able to move forward and improve in order to increase in numbers and spread to new localities. We began the work in Taiwan in 1949, and in six to seven years the number of people in the meetings increased from four or five hundred people to forty or fifty thousand people, and many local churches were established. Regretfully, the increase stopped. There has not been any increase since 1961. All the churches fell into the condition of maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1985, I was saddened by the situation. On the one hand, I felt that I had not provided a better way; on the other hand, I felt that the saints who have been here for twenty to thirty years could have found a way. Even though we faithfully preach the gospel to our friends and neighbors, invite people to love feasts, and even rent cars to take them to the meetings, year after year almost no one is gained for the church life. Perhaps many were baptized, but few remained. For example, out of ten people who are baptized, less than one would remain in the church life. Therefore, the number of those in the churches has not increased.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I am sorry that I did not provide a way for better results; on the other hand, I am concerned for our future. What will we do if we do not have a way to go on? We have been in Taiwan for nearly forty years. We began the work exactly thirty-eight years ago on August 1, 1949. Even though Taiwan is not a large island, only one out of every forty people is a Christian. This ratio is too low. This proves that we have not preached the gospel with our whole heart and our whole strength. We are indebted to the Lord and to our fellow citizens. This is the reason that we were determined to change the system.</p>
<p>We did not have the confidence to change the system two and a half years ago. However, we are now confident concerning two things. We are confident concerning the effectiveness of door-knocking. In the past we were unable to bring one person to the Lord in one year, but now we can baptize two people in one evening. According to the experience of the full-time trainees, who are also door-knocking in coordination with the local saints, in two terms they baptized twenty thousand people in Taipei and its suburbs. Of these twenty thousand people, more than six thousand are in meetings. These figures exceed our original calculations.</p>
<p>Initially we estimated that out of ten thousand people who are baptized, two thousand five hundred would remain in the church life. This would be one-fourth of those who are baptized. This estimation is based on the parable of the sower in Matthew 13. In this parable the Lord Jesus spoke of four kinds of soil, three of which are not good. In the first kind of soil, which is by the roadside, the seeds that are sown cannot penetrate the soil; instead, Satan comes and takes the seeds away. In the second kind of soil, which is rocky, the seeds spring up and then wither. In the third kind of soil, which is thorny, the seeds are choked and cannot grow. The fourth and last kind of soil is the good earth. Therefore, we estimated that one-fourth of the people who are baptized will be like the good earth.</p>
<p>We also have confidence in the home meetings that are established with the new ones who are gained through door-knocking. We asked the trainees to establish home meetings, and they are now busy visiting people and taking care of more than two thousand home meetings. The trainees made a list of their home meetings, which included the names of the new ones, their address, and their district. Most new ones have at least one meeting in their home a week. Some new ones have two or more meetings a week. There are also new ones who only have one meeting a month. The home meetings do not have a noticeable result; hence, some elders are saying that they have not seen the newly baptized ones. Even some of the brothers and sisters are complaining because the newly baptized ones are not in the big meetings. The saints do not understand what the trainees are doing. The trainees will bring the new ones to our next corporate meeting, but I am concerned that there will not be enough seating in the meeting hall. Then everyone will see what the trainees are doing. For example, there is a hall that has almost one hundred people meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. The same hall also has more than three hundred and seventy new ones in home meetings every week. If only half of those in the home meetings were to join the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, that would be an additional one hundred and eighty people. This is good news that should cause us to rejoice.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE BURDEN<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL BY DOOR-KNOCKING<br />
AND HAVING HOME MEETINGS<br />
FOR NOURISHING THE NEW ONES</h2>
<p>These results show that it is possible to preach the gospel by door-knocking and to nourish the new ones in home meetings. Hence, we must present these ways to the brothers and sisters. We have two to three hundred full-time trainees who are from more than twenty different countries. The rest of the trainees are from the churches in Taiwan. When the trainees complete the training, some of them will probably return to their original localities. Therefore, the new ones need to be transferred gradually to the care of the local brothers and sisters. The local brothers and sisters must be willing to receive this burden. In other words, everything that the trainees are doing must be transferred to the local brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Some of the elders are worried because they have not seen the newly baptized believers. However, I am concerned that when we give them the new ones, they will say that there are too many new ones. Therefore, according to our present situation, the elders must rise up and lead the saints to take the new way. The only way to do this is by door-knocking and having home meetings. This is our church life.</p>
<p>In the past our church life was centered on the meeting hall, and it was very convenient. For example, every administrative district in the city of Taipei has a meeting hall, and each hall has elders, who handle the church affairs, and co-workers, who give messages to release the word. There is a meeting in each hall every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, and there are brothers who bear the responsibility to minister the word in these meetings. The saints only need to enjoy the meetings and say Amen. The word preached among us is higher than what is preached in Christian denominations, and everyone likes to listen to the speaking. However, this old way of meeting is according to our natural man.</p>
<p>For example, a saint who works five or six days a week hopes that on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning he can relax in the meeting by listening to a good message and then fellowship with the brothers and sisters. Therefore, our former way of meeting matched his need, enabling him to relax. However, twenty years of experience has shown that this kind of living has no impact in the gospel; it is unable to gain people. Even though we may baptize many people, few remain. We have experienced the suffering of failing in the gospel and being unable to keep people. Eventually, we are the only ones who remain.</p>
<p>Therefore we must put aside the old way and take the new way with all our strength. Even though there are many saints who still prefer the big meetings, simply enjoying a meeting is not enough to gain people or to keep them. The new way, however, does not merely bring people in; it also causes people to remain. New ones are brought in through door-knocking, and they are kept through the home meetings. This way has been proven. How many of the six thousand new believers we can keep depends on what we do. If we do a good job, we will be able to keep at least ninety percent of the new ones. They are our treasures. Whether the new ones remain depends on how we serve and nourish them. If the new ones are properly nourished, they will grow and be healthy.</p>
<p>The life expectancy of human beings has increased because of good food and a hygienic environment. Nearly seventy years ago, many babies died within the first few days of their birth, and the people who lived to be sixty years old needed others to help them walk. However, many who are presently seventy years old live alone and cook their own meals, because they are physically strong. When we take care of nutrition and hygiene, germs will not be able to grow, and we will live long and be healthy. The new ones will remain if they are properly nourished and are healthy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>All the saints, especially the elderly brothers and sisters, love the church. We should never think that we have nothing because we do not practice the old way, do not focus on the meeting hall, and do not stress material offerings. We should not think that the church has nothing or that the church does not need anything. Door-knocking and home meetings are our church life. They are our meeting life. Previously our meetings were in the meeting halls; now they are in people&rsquo;s homes. Previously we preached the gospel in the halls; now we knock on people&rsquo;s doors and lead them to be baptized. The people whom we baptize are our children. We must begin immediately to meet with them in their homes to nourish them. This is our church life, and this is our meeting life. After we meet with them for a period of time, we will eventually break bread, have prayer meetings, and have meetings to read the Bible and study the truth with them. This is our church life. Hence, all the activities of the church life are now in the homes.</p>
<p>In the past everyone in northern China liked to hire Cantonese nurses as servants, because the Cantonese nurses could do everything. We all need to be Cantonese nurses, those who are able to serve as elders, responsible brothers, and full-timers. In other words, we must be able to shepherd people, minister the word, baptize people, and teach <em>Life Lessons</em> and <em>Truth Lessons.</em> We must be able to do all these things without relying on others.</p>
<p>In the past when we met in the meeting hall, we asked who was giving the message that day. If a &ldquo;competent&rdquo; brother was speaking, we were happy, and we thanked the Lord. If a brother whom we did not think was competent was speaking, we were disappointed. We no longer need to ask who will be giving the message, because we will be the ones speaking. Regardless of whether you are a brother or a sister, as long as you are in a home meeting, you will speak. The brothers and the sisters should function. We must all serve as Cantonese nurses; everyone must function and be able to do everything. This is our training.</p>
<p>Everything with human beings depends on habits. As soon as something becomes our habit, we feel that it is good, but when we are not accustomed to doing something, we feel uncomfortable with it. We have the habit of meeting in the old way; hence, we feel that it is very good. The administration of the church is orderly; some saints arrange chairs, some dust, some sweep, others minister the word, and still others preach the gospel. Everyone is comfortable doing things according to their habit.</p>
<p>In the same way, over the past few months the saints in the training have become accustomed to the new church life of door-knocking, baptizing people, and nourishing people in home meetings. They feel that this kind of life is very good. They have developed the habit of door-knocking and leading people to be baptized. If we ask them to stop door-knocking or baptizing people, they will feel a lack. Moreover, the trainees love the people who are saved and baptized. They love to visit the new ones and have home meetings with them. The trainees rejoice when the new ones throw away their idols or when their relatives no longer oppose them.</p>
<p>This is the sweetness of caring for the children we beget. Before we beget children, we do not know that we love children, but after giving birth to a child, as we look at him and feed him, we feel that he is very lovely, and we love him more. All mothers are like this; even the ugliest child is beautiful in the eyes of his mother. For this reason, it offends a mother to say that her child is ugly. Every mother loves her children. The feelings we have for the new ones should not come from natural affection. We spontaneously develop a feeling toward the new ones, but this should not be natural. It is proper to have feelings, but it is not proper to have natural affection. Proper feelings can be compared to frankincense in the meal offering (Lev. 2:1), which is acceptable to God. However, natural affection is like honey added to the meal offering. The honey ferments and brings in uncleanness.</p>
<p>An elder who went door-knocking and went to some home meetings testified that he does not want to go back to the old way of being an elder, because he is tired and bored of being an elder for ten years in the old way. Now his church life is full of flavor.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KEY TO TURNING THE MEETING LIFE</h2>
<p>The key to turning the church life from the old way of meeting to the new way is to go door-knocking and have home meetings. We should immediately make an appointment to meet with those whom we baptize. We have heard many messages in the past, but we are still unable to speak. We must now learn to speak in the home meetings. As a result we will gain more than we did by simply listening to messages. People learn more when they teach a subject than they do when they study it. Similarly, a sister spontaneously learns to be a mother after she is married and has children. Whether or not we can speak, we should all speak in the home meetings.</p>
<p>Hence, our only fear is that we would not take this way. This is a glorious way with a bright future. This is the reason that we are changing the system. Before we changed the system, we saw that the old way of Christianity with hired preachers is not a living way. On the one hand, the congregation does not know if they hired a good preacher, and on the other hand, one good preacher cannot do the work of one thousand or ten thousand people. For the increase and spread of the church, we must beget new ones, nourish them, and teach them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOME BEING THE BASIC UNIT</h2>
<p>A society grows through establishing homes. When homes are established, the society has a foundation. When the homes are proper and strong, the society, and even the entire country, is strong. The home is the basic unit of society, and it is the foundation of a country. The reason for Taiwan&rsquo;s strength today is that it has good homes. The parents give their children a good education. In addition, Taiwan is stable, strong, and prosperous because everyone receives a high level of education. Regretfully, we have not paid attention to the homes in the church life. We need to begin with the homes. We need to beget, nourish, and teach new ones in our homes.</p>
<p>We must give the Lord a way to lead people to salvation through door-knocking. This will cause the number of people in the church to increase. The number of people in the church in Taipei has increased by twenty thousand people from this practice. Of these twenty thousand people, six thousand are in meetings. We must be clear that this is the only way. The road is before us; we must simply follow the proper instructions, or there will be problems. We should not remain in the old way; rather, we must take the way of door-knocking and having home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS OF THE HOME MEETINGS&mdash;<br />
THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</h2>
<p>The first essential factor of the home meetings is the Spirit. We must be filled with the Spirit. Hence, we must pray and confess our sins every day, not once every three to five days. Especially when we are preparing to knock on doors or preparing for a home meeting, we must pray and thoroughly confess our sins so that the Lord can cause us to be inwardly filled with the Spirit. We must do this, because the first factor of the meetings is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The second essential factor of our meetings is the Word. Some people may not know how to select a topic from the sixty-six books of the Bible. We have published <em>Life Lessons,</em> in which the important points in the Bible have been compiled by topic into lessons with verses and explanations. When we meet with people, we can read the lessons with them. Instead of speaking too much, we should lead them to read by repeating, to read with emphasis, to read livingly, and to pray-read the contents of the lessons. In this way the verses, explanations, and main points of each lesson will enter into them. We simply need to visit people every week and read a lesson with them to inject God&rsquo;s Word and the light of His truth into them. In less than six months we will see the results. God&rsquo;s Word is full of life, light, and truth. When the Word enters into the new ones, it will release them and sanctify them.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word supplies man with light and life. The four volumes of <em>Life Lessons</em> with a total of forty-eight lessons are in our hands. If we are familiar with the contents of each lesson, when we visit the new ones, we will know from speaking with them which lesson they need. We do not need to read through the lessons in sequence; instead, based on the need of the new ones, we can decide which lesson to read, just as a doctor gives medication according to the symptoms of his patient. The young people should thoroughly study each of the forty-eight lessons. We should understand and memorize the lessons so that we are constituted with the lessons. Then when we have a home meeting with people, we will spontaneously speak God&rsquo;s word. When we visit a new one, it will be easy for light, life, and truth to enter into the new ones because the Lord is within us, and we have His Word, light, and life.</p><h2 class="head1">PROBLEMS FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED<br />
IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In the home meetings we frequently encounter problems. After some people believe in the Lord, they do not want to destroy their idols. This is a difficult problem. In principle, if a person is not willing to destroy his idols, we should not be quick to baptize him. But what should we do when a person believes in the Lord and knows that he can no longer worship idols but still wants to keep them? If we force him to destroy his idols, he will stop contacting us. We cannot force him, and we cannot push him. We should simply explain to him that all idols should be destroyed.</p>
<p>Whether we should baptize a person who has believed in the Lord but is unwilling to destroy his idols depends on the situation. Some people should not be baptized; they should wait. Other people should be baptized. There have been people who refused to destroy their idols before they were baptized, but after they were baptized, they experienced a turn and destroyed their idols. Hence, we should not be strict concerning this matter. A person who has believed and been baptized is saved. However, it is not acceptable for him to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table if he has not destroyed his idols. We must have proper discernment in these matters. A household that has not destroyed their idols must not partake of the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>There is also the problem of the new ones who smoke. We believe in the Lord, have His life, and are sanctified; therefore, we do not like to see believers smoking cigarettes. This is especially true because we know that smoking is hazardous to their health. However, we have seen many examples of believers who read the Bible and attend meetings even though they smoke. After a short period of time they will stop smoking. We are overzealous if we insist that people who are addicted to smoking should stop before we baptize them.</p>
<p>A more difficult situation to deal with involves new ones who drink alcoholic beverages. In America it is difficult to find a family that does not drink alcohol. Many families have a small glass of wine with every meal. It seems as though they cannot eat their meal if they do not drink wine. What should we do? We must exercise discernment in this matter. Some people should be baptized, and others should wait. There is no definite rule. We should observe the situation and then decide. People cannot change their habits immediately after we preach the gospel to them. The Lord&rsquo;s life must grow in them, and then their habits will spontaneously change. There are testimonies of believers who smoked, drank alcoholic beverages, and went to the movies but gradually stopped doing these things because the Lord&rsquo;s life in them grew.</p>
<p>We are wrong to expect people to drop their bad habits immediately after hearing the gospel. Such an expectation is unrealistic. Therefore, we should not do too much or too little; instead, we should maintain our contact with the new ones according to the truth. If we feel that their condition is such that they should not be baptized, we should continue supplying them in the home meetings until we feel that they are ready to be baptized. Then they should be baptized. We must all be able to discern these conditions because there may be only two saints coordinating together for a home meeting. Thus, we must learn the lessons. Regardless of the situations we encounter, we must deal with them in a proper way. We should be neither too much nor too little. We must maintain our contact with people, and we must always give them grace whenever we contact them.</p>
<p>We are frequently asked, &ldquo;What church do you belong to?&rdquo; We should learn how to answer this question. We need to know the meaning of the word <em>church</em> and the source of the church. We should also know how the Lord raised up His recovery in mainland China more than sixty years ago. There is no need to give too many details when we speak; instead, we should give people an overview and let them know that there are fifty to eighty thousand saints in approximately one hundred local churches in Taiwan. Furthermore, we should explain that the recovery has more than six hundred local churches in over thirty countries on all six continents. If we speak to people in this way, they will want to come and see the meetings. When they express such a desire, we should not hesitate; rather, we should invite them to the Lord&rsquo;s table to break bread with us so that they can touch the atmosphere of loving the Lord in the church.</p>
<p>The full-time trainees do not know how to respond when people ask about the church. They hesitate to give a straight answer. This is wrong. We should not hesitate to bring people to the meetings. We simply need to explain that our church is different from the denominations in Christianity. We should explain that we have big meetings in the meeting halls and that we have home meetings like the meeting in their home. We should also explain that a few households with eight to ten people can eventually combine to have a group meeting and that perhaps two groups with a few dozen people can come together to have a joint meeting. In addition, we go to the meeting hall to have a large blending meeting every one or two months. The large blending meetings can be like the meetings we have had in the stadium. We should explain all these things to the new ones so that they are clear about the church life and understand that this is the way of the church.</p>
<p>We should not avoid responding to a question; otherwise, the new ones will misunderstand us or become suspicious. When they ask about our occupation, we should tell them that we serve full time. If they ask how we take care of our living expenses, we should say that we look to the Lord to meet the needs for our living. The Lord touches the church, and the church gives us support regularly. The Lord may also touch the brothers and sisters to give an individual offering to us. If a person says that he wants to give an offering, we should explain the principles of material offerings to him. We must not withhold anything when we speak to people, because when we hide things, we become mysterious, and this causes people to either misunderstand us or become suspicious. We should be prepared to answer in a good way the questions that people ask. We can explain that we do not write our name on the envelope when we make an offering and that it does not matter how much we give. We follow the principle presented in the Bible in Matthew 6:3, which says, &ldquo;When you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a new one asks how the offerings are used, we should explain clearly that the general offerings are used to build, repair, and renovate meeting halls. The offerings are also used to purchase chairs, tables, and other items that are necessary for the regular operation of the halls. We may also explain that offerings designated to support those who serve full time should also be placed in the offering box. After the offering box is opened, the envelope will be given to the full-time serving one.</p>
<p>If the new ones express concern for the poor brothers and sisters, or if they are burdened for someone who is sick and unable to pay his hospital expenses, we should teach them to write the saint&rsquo;s name on the envelope and put the envelope in the offering box. When the offering box is opened, the envelope will be given to the saint. We should explain these things clearly. We may eventually suggest that the new ones have an offering box in their home meeting. We should explain that two brothers who are trustworthy should be responsible to count and record the offerings and to take care of the matters related to the offerings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE NEW WAY&mdash;<br />
EVERYONE FUNCTIONING</h2>
<p>In principle, whenever the new ones ask a question, we must give them a clear explanation. In addition, from the time that they are baptized, we should take the new ones door-knocking with us so that they can learn how to sing the hymns, read the Bible, and lead the meetings. We should lead and teach them from the beginning of their Christian life, just like parents teach their children to speak and to write when they are small. In other words, we should teach the new ones <em>Life Lessons</em> and also lead them into the practice of what they are reading. If we will do this, after a year and a half, the new ones will be able to do everything that we do. They will learn how to go door-knocking and how to care for other new ones. This is our church life. Our church life is knocking on doors to preach the gospel, leading people to be baptized, having home meetings to nourish the new ones, and perfecting them. Once a week we break bread together in the meeting halls, and every three or four weeks we have a big meeting of the church for blending.</p>
<p>In the way we practiced the church life in the past, the saints were not perfected. We preached the gospel, but not many people were saved; we cared for people, but not many people remained; and we visited people, but there was no result. We have known one another for many years; hence, there was nothing for us to do but go to the big meetings. However, in the new way the needs in the church are great. At present there are at least six thousand people in Taipei who need to be cared for by the brothers and sisters. Hence, everyone must offer themselves and exercise their function. The elders should also make arrangements for the elderly saints who cannot go door-knocking or go to home meetings but can pray and fellowship in the meeting hall.</p>
<p>Almost everyone in the world knows about Christianity. People know that believers worship God every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. Therefore, some of the people who come to our Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings were not contacted by door-knocking. They came to our meeting halls of their own accord because they wanted to attend a Christian meeting. For the sake of taking care of these believers, the meeting halls should have a Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. If there is not a meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, they will think that the church has left, and we will owe them an apology. Hence, we need the meetings in the halls to care for these believers. In the new way, we create opportunities for those who love the Lord to be able to function. In other words, all the saints are employed. In the past the saints were unemployed, but now there is a great need for the saints to give themselves. We need everyone to function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY BEING A NOBLE SERVICE</h2>
<p>After the period of time when the brothers and sisters went door-knocking and led home meetings, many people in the communities expressed their thankfulness to us. The new ones who were visited four or five times say continually that they admire our perseverance in visiting them. Eventually this touches them, and they are baptized. They know that we do not want to cheat them; instead, we desire to bring the Lord Jesus to them and to give them the Bible, truth, and light so that they can receive salvation. When we knock on their door the first time, they may not understand these things; hence, they might become angry and slam the door in our faces. However, after they believe in the Lord, they thank us for preaching the Lord Jesus to them and bringing salvation to them.</p>
<p>From this we can see that what we are doing in the new way is a noble service. The evils in society that are reported in the newspapers show the need for the gospel. When we knock on doors, we are bringing the gospel, life, and godliness to society. It will be a tremendous blessing for us to gospelize Taiwan.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">MAKING A PROFIT<br />
AND GIVING PEOPLE FOOD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CONSIDERATE OF ONE ANOTHER<br />
AND SHARING THE BURDEN</h2>
<p>In order for a training to be successful, the trainers and the trainees need to be blended together so that they can work together. It is difficult to carry out the training if the trainees are scattered. The church is under the administration and leadership of the elders, but because most of the elders have jobs, it is difficult for them to participate in the training. On the one hand, they bear the responsibility of being an elder in the church, and on the other hand, they work to support their families. In today&rsquo;s industrial and commercial society, earning a living can be compared to fighting a battle; everyone must endeavor, compete, and struggle for his existence.</p>
<p>We should not criticize the elders by asking why they do not attend the training or why they do not go door-knocking when the saints go door-knocking. The elders desire to participate in the training and to go door-knocking, but their situations do not allow them to do so. We are a family, and we should understand one another&rsquo;s situation and be considerate of one another. The trainers should be able to take care of the needs of the training, and the elders should bear their responsibilities. We should all function to meet the need through fellowship. When the elders lack the time to take care of the various needs, they should allow others to help them in the administration of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHANGING OUR CONCEPT BEING<br />
THE DIFFICULTY IN CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>It is difficult for us as human beings to change our concepts; hence, it is not easy to change the system. The 1911 revolution in China is an example. Nearly eighty years ago Sun Yat-sen led the revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and established the Republic of China. However, the fact that there are still problems in China today indicates that the revolution was not entirely successful. This shows that it is not easy to change a system.</p>
<p>When I was a young student in Chefoo, Western influence was prevalent. There were many foreign consulates, and there were post offices for countries such as France, Japan, and Germany. I attended an American school that was founded by an American missionary board. The school was an international school with students from Korea, Russia, and other countries. Some of the students wore Western suits, but when they wore their suits outside the school premises, people insulted them. A person was also reviled if he spoke English. Thus, at that time I did not wear Western suits, and I dared not speak English. In 1949 when I came to Taiwan, I still wore Chinese-style clothes and shoes. I did not begin wearing Western suits until I traveled abroad, because it was difficult for me to change my conservative concept. Now it is natural for me to wear a Western suit. Related to English, even though I studied English as a youth, I still speak poorly because the environment did not allow me to practice. I was scolded whenever I spoke English. Now speaking English is a trend, and sooner or later everyone must learn to speak it.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s church has come to a standstill both in Christianity and in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery; there is no spread and no increase. Christianity has been in Taiwan for more than a century, but today only one person out of every forty is a Christian. Even in America Christianity is not spreading. This proves that the old system is wrong, because it kills the function of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEMINARY EDUCATION BEING DIFFERENT<br />
FROM THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Christianity emphasizes pastors and preachers. Therefore, there are many seminaries around the world. The seminaries all teach Old Testament Hebrew and New Testament Greek. This is good because both of these languages are useful. However, the seminaries do not teach classes that are according to the divine truth. In their history classes they consider matters such as whether the Pentateuch was written by Moses and whether the biblical record concerning Abraham is reliable. In their geography classes they research which lands belonged to Pharaoh and to other kings. In addition to these courses, they also teach psychology and philosophy. However, the more that people study psychology and philosophy, the further they are from God, and the more they feel that the Bible is not reliable.</p>
<p>What is taught in the seminaries is different from what we teach in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies are full of light, life, and truth. Pastors and preachers graduate from the seminaries and teach the Bible, but people are often not satisfied with what they teach.</p>
<p>Seminaries emphasize the preaching of the gospel, and as a result, many people are saved. It is regrettable, however, that after their salvation these people cannot obtain an adequate supply of life. Seminaries also pay a great deal of attention to the methods of preaching the gospel, to sermons, and to managing the church. They also study how to be social, how to contact people, and how to understand human psychology. Even though the seminary students have the Bible in their hands, they may not understand the things in the Bible. They know what the Bible says concerning Abraham and Moses, but they do not fully believe or receive what is recorded in the Bible. Some believers think that the identity of the author of the book of Hebrews is still undetermined, but we are clear that Paul wrote Hebrews. These points show that Christianity is poor because it does not teach people to enter into the truth and revelation of the Bible. For this reason, we must change the system to ensure that the condition of the church meetings does not fall into the condition of Christianity.</p><h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM<br />
ENABLING EVERYONE TO FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Before we began to change the system, our condition was only slightly different from that of Christianity. We had a weekly big meeting in which a brother released a message and the saints listened. We did not refer to the brother as a preacher; rather, we referred to him as a speaking brother, as one who speaks from the platform, or as one who ministers the word. He was not referred to as a preacher, but he functioned as a preacher. Even though our messages had some light, life, and truth in them and were somewhat higher than what was preached in Christianity, we maintained the abnormal condition of one person speaking and everyone else listening. When people only listen, they do not need to do anything. The saints were unable to lead home meetings, because they only listened to messages for many years. This can be compared to a housewife who does not know how to cook because for many years she has been eating food prepared by others. This proves that our old system did not build up the believers.</p>
<p>If the few speaking brothers are absent, the saints cannot prepare their own meals. Sister Lee takes care of everything concerning what I eat and drink; consequently, I do not know how to do anything in the kitchen. In the same way, the pastors in Christianity and the speaking brothers among us have created a situation in which no one else can speak the truth. For this reason, we must change the system. We cannot allow this situation to continue. Whether or not we know how to cook, we must all rise up and cook. It does not matter whether we make mistakes; eventually, we will prepare a delicious meal.</p>
<p>We should not be set in our concepts and think that it is normal for only one person to speak while everyone else merely listens. We also should not receive this speaking as if it were merely another message to listen to. We need a change in our concept. We are changing the system so that everyone will give themselves to &ldquo;prepare meals.&rdquo; Those who know how to cook should cook, and those who do not know how to cook should also cook. If the food is burned, we can eat it, and if the food is not done, we can still eat it. If we will practice for at least six months, the meals we prepare will be delicious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOOR-KNOCKING BEING TO MAKE PROFIT<br />
AND HOME MEETINGS BEING TO GIVE PEOPLE FOOD</h2>
<p>The record in the Bible is wonderful. Two thousand years ago the Lord taught His disciples the things that we need to pay attention to today. We need to knock on doors and we need to have home meetings. The purpose of door-knocking is to make a profit. If we gain many sons of peace, we make a profit. The Lord condemns the evil and slothful slave in Matthew 25 because he did not make any profit. The evil and slothful slave said, &ldquo;Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow&rdquo; (v. 24). When we are in the Lord&rsquo;s work, the Lord requires us to do what we are unable to do. In this sense, the Lord is a hard man.</p>
<p>The evil and slothful slave said that the master was hard, and the master did not deny this word. Instead, he seemed to respond, &ldquo;You are right. Since you know that I am like this, you should have made a profit with the money you received.&rdquo; This word is not a small admonishment; rather, this is a serious command and a strict warning. One day the Lord will return, and He will settle accounts with us. He will ask what profit we earned with the talent He gave us. Through door-knocking we can make a profit. Before we changed the system, most of us had not made any profit, but now everyone who goes door-knocking can make a profit. From this we can see the need to change the system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must care for the sons of peace who are gained through door-knocking. Therefore, the Lord says, &ldquo;Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?&rdquo; (24:45). We can faithfully give food at the proper time in the home meetings. Hence, we must all learn how to prepare food and give it to the new ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO USE <em>LIFE LESSONS</em></h2>
<p>In order to use <em>Life Lessons</em> in the home meetings, we must have an understanding of the lessons. The title of the first lesson is &ldquo;Knowing That You Are Saved.&rdquo; After reading the title, we should read the outline. The first point in the outline is on the significance of salvation. The second point is concerning the proofs of salvation. This includes the outward proof, the inward proof, and the proof of love. The outward proof is by the word of the Bible, the inward proof is by the Holy Spirit in our spirit, and the proof of love is that we love God&rsquo;s children because we have experienced the eternal life of God. We love the brothers and sisters in the Lord. This threefold proof gives us the assurance that we are saved. We need to know this general outline so that we can speak with others according to the outline.</p>
<p>When we teach the first lesson, we should let people know that salvation refers to a person&rsquo;s being saved before God, which includes being forgiven of sins, being spared from perdition, being regenerated, having the eternal life of God, and becoming a child of God. We should not fear repeating this, because the new believers need to know it. We should even use pray-reading to apply these words to the new believers. We should speak concerning the outward proof and say that this proof is the Bible. Then we should lead the new ones to pray-read the verses quoted in <em>Life Lessons</em> so that the new ones may know the verses. We should also speak of the inward proof and say that God has given us the Holy Spirit who witnesses within our spirit that we are the children of God. If we simply speak the points, it will be a great help to the new believers.</p><h2 class="head1">A DEEPER LESSON IN <em>LIFE LESSONS</em>&mdash;<br />
KNOWING CHRIST</h2>
<p>There are some deep topics in <em>Life Lessons.</em> In this section we will consider the deepest lesson in the first volume, &ldquo;Knowing Christ.&rdquo; I hope that you will spend some time on your own to study this lesson.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sacred Titles of Christ</h2>
<p>This lesson begins with the sacred titles of Christ. This refers to the sacred names of Christ. Even Christians who have believed in the Lord for many years do not understand the precious names of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first title is <em>Jesus,</em> which means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior.&rdquo; The Lord is the salvation of Jehovah for our enjoyment. The second title is <em>Christ,</em> which means &ldquo;the anointed One of God.&rdquo; The Lord was anointed by God to carry out God&rsquo;s commission. The third title is <em>Emmanuel.</em> The ending <em>el</em> in the Hebrew names in the Old Testament refers to God. The <em>el</em> in <em>Emmanuel</em> also refers to God. The name <em>Emmanuel</em> means &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; Thus, the three names&mdash;<em>Jesus, Christ,</em> and <em>Emmanuel</em>&mdash;considered together mean that Jehovah came to be our Savior so that we may receive His salvation. They also mean that Christ is God&rsquo;s anointed One to carry out God&rsquo;s commission and to be with us. On the one hand, He saves us, and on the other hand, He carries out God&rsquo;s commission and is with us, never leaving us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Person of Christ</h2>
<p>The first two points concerning the person of Christ are that He is God and that He is the Son of God. The Son of God is God. There is no difference, because the Son of God is just God. Christ is a man, He is the Creator, and He is the Firstborn of all creation. As God, He is the Creator, and as man, He is a creature. This point still poses a problem in Christianity. Some believers say that Christ is a man, not a creature. However, the Bible clearly says that Christ is also a creature (Col. 1:15). If He is a man, how can He not be a creature? The fact that Christ has a body of blood and flesh proves that He is a creature. In His divinity Christ is God, the Son of God, and the Creator, and in His humanity He is man and the Firstborn of all creation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Work of Christ</h2>
<p>The first great step in the work of Christ is creation. The universe did not come into existence through a process of gradual changes; rather, it was created by Christ. After Christ created the universe, a considerable amount of time elapsed before He was incarnated to be a man. This is the second step in Christ&rsquo;s work&mdash;becoming flesh. After becoming flesh, Christ lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, and then He went to the cross and died to accomplish redemption for us. This is the third step in the work of Christ. After His crucifixion Christ resurrected from among the dead. This is the fourth step in His work. His resurrection is the proof of our justification (Rom. 4:25). When Christ resurrected, we were made alive together with Him and raised up together with Him (Eph. 2:5-6). We were also regenerated in the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>The fifth step in the work of Christ is His ascending into the heavens. In this fifth step, as God&rsquo;s Anointed, Christ accomplished two matters for us. In ascending to the heavens, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men (Eph. 4:8). The phrase <em>those taken captive</em> refers to the believers. We were previously captives of Satan. However, in His resurrection Christ made us His captives and thereby released us from our captivity to Satan. Christ has made us His captives, thereby taking us out of the hands of Satan.</p>
<p>In His victorious resurrection Christ led us as His captives, released us from the captivity of Satan, and gave us as gifts to the church. Ephesians 4:8 is not a simple verse.</p>
<p>As a captive of Satan, man is in death. Man&rsquo;s spirit is deadened, and his body dies daily. An unbeliever will go to Hades when he dies. On the last day he will come out of Hades and enter into the second death, the lake of fire (Rev. 20:13-15). As Satan&rsquo;s captive, man experiences death in this way. However, in His crucifixion Christ bore man&rsquo;s sins. Then Christ was buried, and He resurrected on the third day. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection proves that regenerated believers are justified by God. In His resurrection Christ led these believers captive, taking them out of the hand of Satan and out of death. Christ then led these captives out of death to the heavens and offered them to God the Father. The Father received the captives and gave them back to Christ. Christ then gave the believers as gifts to the church. This is how the believers become gifts. These gifts include the apostles Paul and Peter, Philip the evangelist, and the rest of the believers. These gifts are the riches of the church.</p>
<p>In Christ&rsquo;s ascending to the heavens we were &ldquo;seated...together with Him in the heavenlies&rdquo; (Eph. 2:6). This is very deep. In God&rsquo;s eyes the believers in Christ are not on the earth but in the heavenlies. Who did this? Christ did it when He led us captive and took us out of Satan&rsquo;s hand and brought us into the heavenlies. Every believer is a gift to the church. Apparently we are on the earth, but in reality we are in heaven, in the heavenlies. Even though we live and work on the earth, we are a people in the heavenlies. We are in the heavenlies, not on the earth. This matter was accomplished for us by Christ in His resurrection.</p>
<p>The sixth step in the work of Christ is the fulfilling of His heavenly ministry. Many Christians and even pastors and theologians do not understand this step. When Christ was on earth, He accomplished His earthly ministry. In His earthly ministry Christ went to the cross, died for man, and offered Himself to God for the accomplishing of redemption. After His resurrection Christ began to fulfill His heavenly ministry in the heavens. This is one of the great matters for which God anointed Christ. In His heavenly ministry Christ is working in four ways on our behalf.</p>
<p>Christ is the Mediator of a better covenant. Hebrews 8:6 says, &ldquo;He has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant.&rdquo; <em>Life Lessons</em> explains that Christ enacted the new covenant by His death (Matt. 26:28) and then ascended to the heavens to be the Mediator of the new covenant. He is now executing the new covenant upon those who believe in Him. On the cross Christ poured out His blood to cleanse us of our sins and to redeem us because as sinners we had lost God and His blessing. We were worthy of being condemned by God. Christ&rsquo;s blood also enacted the new covenant. The first item we receive in the new covenant is the forgiveness of sins, and the second item is the divine life.</p>
<p>How can these two items be applied to man? After the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant in His death, He resurrected from the dead and then ascended to heaven. In resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit. Now whenever a person repents, believes into the Lord, and calls upon His name, the Lord enters into that person as the life-giving Spirit and begins to execute the new covenant within him. In executing the new covenant, He first causes us to sense that our sins have been forgiven by God. Then He causes us to realize that we have God&rsquo;s life within us. Today we enjoy Christ in His executing of the new covenant.</p>
<p>When we repent, confess our sins, and call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, He enters into us as the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit causes us to taste the sweetness of having our sins forgiven by God and to sense the life of God within us. From this point on the Lord Jesus is not merely in heaven; He is also within us. We are now connected to heaven. In other words, Christ is in our spirit, and He is also in heaven; He is in heaven, and He is also in our spirit. This is the same as electricity that is in the power plant and also in every light bulb. Hence, the electricity in the light bulbs and the electricity in the power plant are one. When the electricity enters the light bulb, the electric current connects the light bulb to the power plant.</p>
<p>Today we are in heaven, and heaven is in our spirit. When we meet together, heaven is among us. Christ as the heavenly &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; connects us to heaven, and He is constantly operating. When He operates, He transmits all the blessings of the new covenant into us. As a result we have joy, peace, rejoicing, understanding, wisdom, light, and power. These items are blessings of the new covenant. When we first called upon the Lord Jesus, we were joined to Him. If we are willing to constantly fellowship with Him and call on His name, instead of neglecting Him, He will operate within us as the different items of the new covenant. This is how He executes the new covenant.</p>
<p>Hebrews 8:1-2 says that Christ &ldquo;sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle.&rdquo; Christ is a Minister of the true tabernacle. As a minister, Christ is in the heavens, in the true tabernacle, serving the believers. Christ is not only in the heavens as the Mediator to execute God&rsquo;s new covenant; He is also the heavenly Minister who meets our every need by constantly supplying us. Few Christians understand this item concerning Christ as the heavenly Minister, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are able to experience Christ as the heavenly Minister.</p>
<p>Anger is something we are frequently unable to control. It seems as if there is no way to contain our anger. We are saved and love the Lord, but we still become angry and lose our temper. After losing our temper, however, we can always repent and ask the Lord to wash us with His blood and to forgive us. Even though our temper is a real problem, we can experience Christ as the heavenly Minister whenever we are about to lose our temper. As soon as we call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; He supplies us with the heavenly things, and our temper begins to diminish. If we continue to call and receive the heavenly supply, our temper will disappear. This is how Christ serves us as the heavenly Minister.</p>
<p>I often experience Christ as the heavenly Minister. When I give a message, I have a general outline within me, and I know the main points of the message. However, because I do not know the details of how to express these points, I usually pray quietly, and the Lord Jesus always comes when I pray. When He comes, He dispenses Himself into me and gives me the details of the message. The more I contact Him, the more He gives me. We need to learn to contact Christ in this way. Christ can be experienced. He is the heavenly Minister who ministers the divine, heavenly, and spiritual things into us as our supply.</p>
<p>Christ is our High Priest. Hebrews 4:14 says, &ldquo;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.&rdquo; Have you ever experienced Christ as the High Priest? When God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament had a problem with God, they needed a high priest to bear the responsibility of their sins and to offer the sin offering, the burnt offering, or the meal offering to God on their behalf. The duty of the high priest was to take care of God&rsquo;s people. The high priest bore the people before God. Hebrews 7:25 says, &ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them.&rdquo; Christ is our High Priest to care for us, and we can experience Him at any time. He is able to take care of all our needs, problems, and difficulties before God. The ascended Christ is our High Priest, and He is inside of us. As our High Priest, He takes care of our affairs before God.</p>
<p>Christ is our Advocate. First John 2:1-2 says, &ldquo;If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins.&rdquo; Jesus Christ the Righteous is our Advocate, our defense attorney. He is also the propitiation for our sins. A person in a law court needs a lawyer to defend him against the accusations of his opponent. Jesus Christ is in us, and He is in heaven as our Advocate.</p>
<p>This truth is hardly present in Christianity. This is the reason that the Lord must have a recovery. We have been commissioned with this heavy burden. We cannot remain in the Christian denominations. We must rise up to be Christians in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>When we speak to the new ones concerning Christ in His heavenly ministry, we do not need to say too much. We should give simple and clear explanations concerning Christ as the Mediator of the new covenant, the Minister of the true tabernacle, our High Priest, and our Advocate. The new ones have never heard these points; therefore, we should not give complex explanations. We merely need to show them that the Lord Jesus was not only our Redeemer on the cross, but in heaven today He is the Mediator of the new covenant, the Minister of the true tabernacle, our great High Priest, and our Advocate before God.</p>
<p>It is difficult for the new believers to fully understand these matters, but if they have some knowledge, they will be able to experience Christ as the Mediator, the Minister, the High Priest, and the Advocate. When the situations arise, the Holy Spirit will operate to remind them of what they know. Then they will experience the Lord Jesus in His heavenly ministry. Sometimes they may sense that the Lord Jesus is praying for them as their great High Priest. At other times they may feel that they can approach God, even though they have offended Him, because the Lord Jesus is their Advocate before God. Thus, the knowledge we bring them will gradually become their experience in their daily life.</p>
<p><em>Life Lessons</em> seems simple and easy, but it is not that simple. Every topic has more than ten verses that are the most important verses in the Bible related to that topic. As long as we are faithful to fellowship these truths with the new ones, the Holy Spirit will spontaneously use different situations to remind them of these truths and turn these truths into experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING OUR BEST TO HAVE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In Matthew 24 and 25 the Lord commissioned us with two matters. He gave us spiritual gifts to use as our capital to do business so that we can earn a profit. In other words, He gave us salvation, and He wants us to use this salvation to gain sons of peace through knocking on doors. After we make a profit by gaining sons of peace, we need to have home meetings with them to give them food.</p>
<p>Children are cared for in homes. It would be difficult for society to exist if all the children were cared for in orphanages. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, a household, or family, is a unit, and children are cared for in a unit. Previously, a household in Chinese society had five generations living together. Presently, however, Chinese society is composed of small families because of the influence of Western society. A small family unit is according to the Bible (Gen. 2:24).</p>
<p>We have seen this principle; hence, we should all have home meetings, and we should go to people&rsquo;s homes. If we meet only in the meeting halls, the number of attendants will decrease. We must open our homes to the brothers and sisters in order to perfect them. We must make a profit by gaining the sons of peace through knocking on people&rsquo;s doors. Then we must feed the new ones by giving them food in the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE MAKING A PROFIT<br />
AND GIVING PEOPLE FOOD</h2>
<p>We must fellowship with the elders in every locality so that the saints can go door-knocking to make a profit. The saints should also have home meetings to give the new ones food at the proper time. We need to answer the Lord&rsquo;s call. We should consecrate not only the Lord&rsquo;s Day to the Lord; we should also consecrate three evenings a week to Him. Even though we are busy with our families and other matters, we should do our best to separate some time to knock on doors or to have home meetings. The saints who cannot give three evenings a week should not be discouraged. We should all do our best to serve when we have the opportunity, and we should do our best to serve when we do not have the opportunity; we should look for the opportunity. In the new way everyone bears the burden and the responsibility to serve. The elders are not the only ones who bear responsibility in the new way.</p>
<p>If everyone participates, we will not need to go out every night; rather, every saint will be able to go out a few evenings a week. However, we should not be burning one day and cold the next ten days. We should serve with persistence by going every week with much prayer. We knock on doors to make a profit by gaining people, and we have meetings in the homes of the new ones to give them food. As a result, our work will please the Lord and be acceptable to Him. If we continue in this way, we will receive a reward when He returns. From now on we must serve in this way in the churches. We should not serve in the way of organization, nor should we hire a select group of people to serve on behalf of the others. Instead, all the brothers and sisters should rise up to be trained. Everyone can knock on doors to preach the gospel, and everyone can have a home meeting to lead others to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word and <em>Life Lessons.</em> This is our way, and this is our hope.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">JOINTS, SINEWS, AND<br />
THE OPERATION OF EACH ONE PART</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:16; Col. 2:19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE JOINTS AND SINEWS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 says, &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.&rdquo; The words <em>out from whom</em> mean out from Christ the Head. <em>Through every joint of the rich supply</em> indicates that the joints are a means of supply; <em>being joined together and being knit together</em> refers to the function of the sinews. Although this verse does not mention sinews, Colossians 2:19 uses the word <em>sinews</em>. Ephesians 4 shows that the function of the sinews is to join and knit the Body together. The joints are for supplying, and the sinews are for joining and knitting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EACH ONE PART</h2>
<p>In addition to the joints and sinews, the Body also has many parts. <em>Each one part</em> refers to the members of the Body. Every part has its own function and its own measure. The measure of a shoulder is large, and the measure of a little finger is small. Nevertheless, despite the difference in measure, each part has a function. The function of a part depends on the measure of that part.</p>
<p>Every believer is a member of the Body of Christ. Some believers are joints, and their life and work are for supplying. Other believers are sinews, and they cause all the members to be connected together through joining and knitting. Hence, in the Body of Christ there are joints for supplying, and there are sinews for joining and knitting. Furthermore, there are also many parts, and each of these parts should exercise their function. If any one part does not exercise its function, there will be a problem with that part, and this will cause the entire Body to suffer loss.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENTIRE BODY FUNCTIONING<br />
BEING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>The Bible says that the church is the Body of Christ. Everyone who believes in Christ is a member of the Body. Even though the members differ in measure and function, they must operate in the Body. When we speak, our entire body coordinates, even though our mouth is the part that everyone sees moving. When we make a certain facial expression, many parts of our body, including our ears, our nose, and even our hands, need to act in coordination. If our hands are bound, the tone of our voice will be different, and our facial expression will not be natural. Our entire being will be bound. Hence, we should not think that our hands are unrelated to our speaking or that our eyes and nose are unrelated to our speaking. Whenever we speak, all the members of our body are in coordination and are related to one another. In the same way, the moving and functioning of the entire Body is the new way.</p>
<p>We changed the system because in the old way the hands and feet of the Body were bound. Even the shoulders were bound. Some saints may say that we were not bound, but rather that we were very free in the church life. However, even if we were in the church life for more than ten years, we did not lead anyone to salvation, nor did we take care of anyone. This shows that we were bound. Some saints led people to salvation, because of the old way the new ones did not receive proper care and &ldquo;died prematurely.&rdquo; The most we were able to do was to maintain a meeting life. In the meetings we listened to messages. Even though we murmured that one brother&rsquo;s messages were eloquent and another brother&rsquo;s messages were not, we were unable to speak the truth. This is our true situation.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters can pray with their companions, but they stop praying when another person joins them. Even though they enjoy praying together, they are quiet when they are in the meetings of the church. Many new believers are also like this. They pray in their home meetings, but they are unable to pray in the big meetings. They fear the large meetings; hence, they do not pray. This shows that in the old way of meeting, people were bound. Even the young brothers and sisters, who are lively and full of vitality when they meet together, do not know how to function when they are in a big meeting.</p>
<p>This fellowship is not to point out our shortcomings; rather, we are examining our true condition. When we stand before the Lord, we want to receive a reward, not suffer punishment.</p>
<p>We have been meeting in Taipei for more than thirty years, but our numbers have gradually decreased. If the system is not completely changed over in the next two or three years, and if our numbers continue to decrease, then in another ten years we will be finished. Hence, we must wake up. If we do not love the Lord, we should give ourselves to love the world, but if we love the Lord, we must give ourselves for this.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL THE MEMBERS<br />
CAUSING THE GRADUAL GROWTH OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>We should all consider before the Lord what the church should do. Every member should rise up to function. Even our little finger has a function in our body. The only way for the Lord to advance among us is through the functioning of every member. According to Ephesians 4:16 and Colossians 2:19, the Body grows when the joints function to supply, the sinews join and knit, and the rest of the members operate according to their measure. Hence, the brothers and sisters should not despise their function. We should not say that we are a new believer, our gift is small, we do not understand the truth, or we do not have a function. If we do not function, we harm ourselves, and we hinder the growth of the Body of Christ. Every member in the Body of Christ must rise up to function in order for the Body to grow gradually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOOR-KNOCKING BEING TO GAIN PEOPLE<br />
AND HOME MEETINGS BEING TO KEEP THEM</h2>
<p>Approximately two thousand of the new ones, who were baptized and were in home meetings over the past eight months, attended the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting in all the halls of the church in Taipei. The full-time trainees made weekly visits to more than six thousand new ones and brought these two thousand new ones to the meeting. In other words, over the past eight months, twenty thousand people were led to salvation, and of these twenty thousand, more than six thousand meet with us regularly. Out of the six thousand new ones, two thousand met with us on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. This proves that the new way of door-knocking and having home meetings is practical.</p>
<p>Two thousand new ones have not attended the meetings of the church in Taipei for the past twenty years. This proves that we can gain people by knocking on doors. The testimonies of the new ones show the working of the Holy Spirit. A few new ones testified that when the brothers and sisters knocked on their door, they were considering how to contact the Lord and come to the church. This was the Holy Spirit working in the same way that He worked when Peter went to the house of Cornelius.</p>
<p>One of the new ones testified that when the brothers and sisters knocked on his door, he was preparing to commit suicide. A person who was planning suicide was saved and baptized. If we did not knock on doors that day, he would have killed himself. Such testimonies prove that the Holy Spirit is working on many people. In the old way we published advertisements in newspapers, sent out invitations, held love feasts, and rented cars to take people to the meeting; however, not many people attended the meeting. Sometimes the people who came did not receive the Lord. However, we have discovered that when we door-knock, people cannot hide from us. Door-knocking is prevailing.</p>
<p>When we knock on a door, the people in that home may not be friendly, but after we speak a few words with them and then read <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> they are happy, and their attitude changes. They will eventually be saved and baptized if we pray for them. This can be accomplished only through door-knocking. Furthermore, soon after being baptized, some people bring their entire family and their colleagues from work to be baptized. A newly baptized believer is like a branch that runs over the wall and continues to grow. If we are faithful to knock on doors, the day will come when our brothers and sisters in the Lord will be all over Taipei.</p>
<p>We should not think that we can go door-knocking according to our own method. If we knock on doors according to our own method, no one will be saved. Therefore, we must be trained. We also need to labor on the home meetings. When we establish a home meeting, we should have proper feelings, not natural affection. Natural affection is of the flesh, but proper feelings are of the Spirit. When we meet with the new ones in their homes, some of them will prepare a meal for us, and others will give us gifts to show their appreciation. We must be careful not to do anything that will issue in natural affection of the flesh and not the proper feelings of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the old way we invited people to the big meetings, but they did not like to come. Hence, even if we baptized one hundred people, only five would remain. However, today we deliver the meetings to people in their homes. The more meetings we deliver to people, the more they taste the flavor of the meetings. Then one day they will come to the meeting hall.</p>
<p>We knock on doors to baptize and gain people, and we have home meetings to nourish and keep them. By these two steps people are gained and kept. From our experience in the church life over the past sixty years, we know that no method is more effective than these two ways. There is presently a desperate need for people to labor on the home meetings, because we have discovered that it is relatively easy to knock on doors and lead people to salvation, but it is not so easy to feed people in the home meetings. Every parent knows that it is easy to give birth to children, but it is difficult to raise them. The full-time trainees have given birth to a large number of children for the church in Taipei. We must consider how to care for these new ones so that they grow up to be healthy.</p>
<p>Last Lord&rsquo;s Day the full-time trainees brought some of the new ones whom they are caring for to the meeting halls, and everyone rejoiced. Even though we highly commended the full-time trainees, we must speak a faithful word, because the meetings were not up to the standard. The full-time trainees gained many new ones through door-knocking and the home meetings, but when they brought the new ones to the meetings, it was as if they were displaying their babies for the brothers and sisters to see. We forgot to pray, and no one paid attention to the content of the meeting. We admired the babies so much that we forgot to feed the babies.</p>
<p>We must take care of the new believers whom we have gained. We should not merely visit them frequently. We must supply them with God&rsquo;s word. We can use <em>Life Lessons</em> to supply them. Thus, the key to the home meetings lies in knowing how to use <em>Life Lessons.</em> We should not think that it is easy for people to understand the text. We must be trained in order to know how to use these lessons in the home meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL THE SAINTS COORDINATING TOGETHER</h2>
<p>The newly baptized brothers and sisters will come to the meeting halls to meet with everyone one Lord&rsquo;s Day every month. We hope that the responsibility for the home meetings will be transferred from the full-time trainees to the brothers and sisters in the church. There are two ways to accomplish this. First, the meeting halls can coordinate with the training center so that the local brothers and sisters can go with the trainees to the home meetings. In this way the brothers and sisters will see what the trainees are doing, and they will meet the new ones in the home meetings. Second, the full-time trainees who are more experienced can make arrangements to visit the meeting halls to promote the matter of caring for the home meetings. The elders in each meeting hall should work together so that the main responsibility for the home meetings will be quickly transferred from the trainees to the saints. If we all rise up to receive this burden by consecrating every Lord&rsquo;s Day plus two or three evenings a week to the Lord, we will be able to take this burden and see the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>The new way is becoming clearer as we practice. After we lead a person to salvation, we must immediately establish a home meeting with him. This is our church life. The most important thing in the home meetings is to supply the new ones with the word and to teach them <em>Life Lessons.</em> The brothers and sisters might not do this as well as the full-time trainees, but as long they do it according to the fellowship, they will be successful. Everything needs practice; if we do not practice, we will not improve. The elderly brothers and sisters should pray for the home meetings. The rest of the saints should fight the battle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE NEW ONES FROM HOME MEETINGS<br />
TO DISTRICT MEETINGS</h2>
<p>There are now three thousand five hundred people meeting in the church in Taipei, of which one thousand five hundred go door-knocking and are in home meetings with the new believers. Two thousand saints meet regularly in the meeting halls. We fellowshipped with the elders concerning the need to strengthen the meetings for <em>Truth Lessons</em> and the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting held in the halls on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We also need to strengthen the prayer meetings and the small group meetings. Some of these meetings are for fighting the battle, and other meetings are for defending what is ours. We must establish home meetings in the homes of the new ones. Then when the time is right, we should bring two or three home meetings together for a meeting. This is a small group meeting. There might even be the need for a new district meeting. Several groups can come together and find a large building within their district to use as a central meeting place for that district. We can also have joint meetings in the meeting halls.</p>
<p>Eventually the Lord will give us a large meeting hall so that once a month we can all meet together. If the Lord gives us 80,000 or 100,000 brothers and sisters in the church, and the large meeting hall can only seat 20,000, we can take turns using the large meeting hall. For example, the first session can use the hall from 8:00 to 10:00 on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, and the second session, from 10:00 to 12:00. There can be a session in the afternoon from 2:00 to 4:00 and another from 4:00 to 6:00. There can also be a session from 7:00 to 9:00 in the evening. If every session has 20,000 people, we can handle 100,000 people in five sessions. If there are more people, we can have another session on Friday night. We can also use the large meeting hall every day. The meeting halls can arrange their meeting times so that the saints can meet together frequently.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING IN ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>We must not rely merely on the speaking brothers; rather, we must all rise up and work together. According to my calculations, if we all rise up, in less than ten years all the people on the island of Taiwan will be our brothers and sisters. Whether or not such a glorious situation will come to pass depends entirely on us. If we work together, we will be successful, and the result will be pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<p>If the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will promote door-knocking and the home meetings, we will eventually knock on every door on the earth. We believe that this way will bring the Lord back. The gospel of the kingdom must be preached to the whole inhabited earth before the end will come. There is no other way to preach the gospel to the whole inhabited earth apart from knocking on people&rsquo;s doors and having home meetings. Many of the new ones testified that they began to knock on doors after they were baptized. Some are even attending the full-time training. This proves that if we work faithfully, the children we beget will be like us. Even though it is somewhat more difficult for those who are pioneering the new way, the ones we bring to the Lord will follow us. They will be Christians who knock on doors, have home meetings, teach <em>Life Lessons,</em> sing hymns, and pray.</p>
<p>If we were to hire preachers, we would not be able to hire enough preachers to meet this need. Even if we were able to find enough preachers, they would kill everyone&rsquo;s function. We cannot continue the method of Christianity and hold big gospel campaigns, because that method does not beget many spiritual descendants. Even though our way appears to be very slow and difficult, a great deal can be accomplished by taking small steps. If all the saints coordinate together through prayer, knocking on doors, and leading the home meetings, in a few years Taiwan will be gospelized.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO RECEIVE THE BLESSING</h2>
<p>Whether we are successful in gospelizing Taiwan depends on our willingness to spread the gospel. As long as we are willing to pray, confess our sins, deal with the natural man and our flesh, be filled with the Spirit, and go door-knocking according to the methods of the training, we will gain people. If one thousand five hundred saints bring one person to salvation every day, in one month we will gain forty-five thousand believers. Of course, we must still take care of our families, our jobs, and our daily living. As long as we do not lack clothing, food, and the necessities of life, our needs are taken care of. We should not be too rich or too poor in our outward appearance. We should be neat and proper so that people do not pity us. We should give our children a proper education and care for our households. After caring for these things, we should give whatever time and money we have to the Lord.</p>
<p>This does not mean that all the saints should drop their jobs and serve the Lord full time. The elders do not need to be full time; on the contrary, they should take good care of their professions, manage their households well, and care for their own children. However, they must give every Lord&rsquo;s Day and two or three evenings per week to the Lord to knock on doors and be in home meetings. The young people should not think that they will ruin their future by giving themselves to the Lord in this way. If they use their time well, they will do well in their studies. There are many testimonies that prove that young people who love the Lord in this way will be top students.</p>
<p>We must live a balanced life before the Lord and make a budget. We should budget our money, and we should also budget our time and our strength. If the elderly saints do not budget their strength, they will not accomplish anything. I also budget my strength. When we live this kind of life, people outside the church will know that our speech is not common, our clothing is proper, and our homes are furnished simply and elegantly without being luxurious and wasteful. This will glorify the Lord. The new way is practical, and it enables us to receive the blessing. Our society and our country will also be blessed by it.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP<br />
CONCERNING DOOR-KNOCKING<br />
AND HOME MEETINGS</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we look to You and ask You to take us through this crucial stage. Give us an inward sense related to how we should proceed with the home meetings and the church meetings so that we can be clear and have the same burden. Lord, give us an open spirit so that we can enter into and touch Your feeling. Thank You for being within us as the Spirit. We are one with You in our spirit. Lord, speak through every person during this time of fellowship so that we can touch Your heart&rsquo;s intention and Your way in our fellowship. May Your presence lead us. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN OPENING WORD</h2>
<p>During two terms of the full-time training more than twenty thousand people were brought into the church in Taipei. One-third of these people are in home meetings; about six thousand people are in at least two thousand home meetings. Presently, the responsibility for caring for these two thousand home meetings rests on the shoulders of six or seven hundred trainees. Almost every day these trainees go to several different homes to care for new ones. However, this term of training will end, and some of the trainees will return to their localities while others will return for another term of the training. Hence, the saints need to take over the care of these homes. I am afraid that the saints in the church in Taipei are not prepared to care for these two thousand home meetings. We need to fellowship concerning this matter.</p>
<p>We gained these new ones and their homes by mobilizing one thousand trainees during two terms of the full-time training. We did not spare time or money in this effort. Who will continue to feed these new ones? The church in Taipei has picked up this burden, and according to our statistics the church has around one thousand five hundred saints attending the training; one thousand are from the city of Taipei, and around five hundred are from the nearby suburbs as far as Taoyuan. We must ask all the brothers and sisters who have heard this fellowship what they intend to do. Since we began to change the system, we have stressed the homes. We said that the Lord&rsquo;s way is in the homes and that the homes are the foundation of the church. During two years of door-knocking, six to seven hundred trainees were busy taking care of homes every day. We discovered that it is not easy to care for the home meetings. How should we proceed?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER USE OF<br />
THE GOD-CREATED HUMAN NATURE</h2>
<p>God created man with many needs. These needs are a part of human nature. Man has a nature that needs to eat and to drink and a nature that delights in doing good works. Man also has a communal nature that enjoys being with other humans; therefore, after people are married, they want children. Having children satisfies an inner need of man. However, even a family is not sufficient; man still needs friends. Man also desires pleasure. People go to places of entertainment to satisfy their human need for companionship. If human beings did not have a communal nature, there would be no need for the places of entertainment.</p>
<p>Human nature was created by God, but it is not easy to respond to our human nature properly. For example, it is not easy for a person to be balanced rather than excessive when he eats. Almost everyone makes mistakes in the matter of eating. People become ill because of their improper response to their desire for food. It is not wrong to eat and drink, but it is wrong to abuse this need. This also applies to man&rsquo;s communal nature. Man needs companions, but the wrong companions can bring a person into different sins. The corrupt things in society are mainly the result of keeping improper companions. There is, however, a noble community in human society, and this community is the church. The church is the noblest community, because the Lord, who is holy, is in the church.</p>
<p>The church life ordained by the Lord is founded upon the home meetings. The home meetings can be compared to eating at home and the big meetings, to eating in a restaurant. When we go to a restaurant, we do not need to work; we simply enjoy. However, people who frequently eat in restaurants are not very healthy. In contrast, food that is prepared at home may not be spicy, but it is healthier. Just as people prefer to eat in restaurants, Christians like to go to big meetings in cathedrals. These meetings can be compared to eating in a restaurant because a person does not need to cook for himself. In the cathedrals there are choirs, prayer ministers, and a minister who gives the blessing; hence, the people do not need to expend any energy. Such a gathering meets the demands of society today. In today&rsquo;s society everyone is busy from morning to night and works five or six days a week. Therefore, they want to sleep late and relax on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. When they go to worship services, the ministers and preachers do everything for them, and they only need to put money in the collection plate. Consequently, everyone likes to attend worship services.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, even though we are taking the Lord&rsquo;s way, we still want to rest on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, contrary to our expectations we are required to function in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings by prophesying. In addition, we must take the church meetings to the homes of the new believers, and everyone in our home is expected to meet. In our hearts we prefer the big meetings because we do not need to speak, pray, or even sing hymns in the big meetings; we can simply sit and enjoy. However, the home meetings are different because we must do everything ourselves in these meetings. The Lord&rsquo;s church has almost no way on this earth, because everyone likes and welcomes the big meetings.</p>
<p>After many years of observation and research, we discovered that in almost every denominational group everyone likes the big meetings. We need to have meetings, but our meetings should be proper. We should gather together to enjoy the big meetings and also the small meetings in the homes. Even though we enjoy eating in restaurants, we must still eat at home.</p>
<p>It is not easy to build up the home meetings according to the Lord&rsquo;s word, because we like the big meetings. We have been meeting in the homes for the past few months, but we still like the big meetings, even though we are bound and our function is annulled in these meetings. For many years we invited people to meetings and preached the gospel to them, but the little fruit that we gained did not remain. This problem is an issue of the big meetings. If we want to solve such problems, we must rely on the small meetings in the homes. However, it is not easy to establish the home meetings, and it is difficult to develop them.</p>
<p>A new believer who has a weekly meeting in his home needs to clean his home and dress neatly for the meeting. On the days that he does not have a meeting in his home, he may be careless with his clothing and watch television, but he cannot be loose on the day of his home meeting. The home meeting will restrict him. When the meeting is in the meeting hall, there are no restrictions on him. He can go to the meetings when he wants to and stay at home when it is not convenient. He is free. This is human nature.</p>
<p>For this reason, we need to properly respond to our God-created nature. A person who properly responds to his human nature pays a price. When we accommodate our human nature, we are loose. The home meetings meet the need of our communal nature, but we must pay a price to respond to our communal nature properly.</p>
<p>In a normal family a person eats three home-cooked meals a day, and parents teach and discipline their children at home. If a household is proper, all the members of that family will be healthy. Some families, however, eat out every day, and the children are not disciplined. The children in these families will be unruly.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOME MEETINGS BEING<br />
THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Christianity has been on the earth for two thousand years, but the gospel still has not been preached to all the corners of the earth. Even though Christianity has been in Taiwan for several hundred years and the island has convenient transportation and communication, there are only about three Christians among every hundred people. During the past eight months, we baptized twenty thousand new ones. If the brothers and sisters receive the burden to care for the home meetings, these twenty thousand new ones will be fed and cared for. We have made calculations and budgets to gospelize Taiwan in the near future. In order to gospelize Taiwan, however, we must labor on the home meetings, because the home meetings are the key to the new way. We are at a crucial stage, and we must consider how to care for the households of the newly baptized saints.</p>
<p>We need to study our past practices and consider how we will allocate and use our time in the future. We should also consider whether our care for the home meetings will be appropriate and effective. These are the issues that we must consider. In one of the churches in central Taiwan, the new believers who went from the home meetings to the meetings of the church have remained. Moreover, all the new ones learned from the saints; the new ones are leading other people to believe in the Lord and are establishing home meetings. Recently we received a letter from the northern part of Italy. The writer said that after reading our books and watching our videos, the believers there were helped to have home meetings. At present there are eleven people meeting together. They learned that we began the new way of door-knocking to preach the gospel, and they began to practice door-knocking. As a result these eleven people gained eleven more through door-knocking. This locality started with eleven people who began to meet in a home because they did not have a meeting hall. Hence, the locality was raised up through home meetings.</p>
<p>The two thousand new households are the result of two terms of the training. This proves that our way is correct and that door-knocking is effective. If we can take good care of these households, we will receive the blessing. However, we must pay a price. We must attend the training, and we must use two or three evenings a week to visit people. If we are willing to pay this price, we will be blessed and our households will be blessed. If we live a normal human life according to our God-created nature, we will receive the blessing; our family will be blessed, our friends and relatives will be blessed, and even the entire society and the entire country will be blessed. May we all receive this burden and rise up to be proper Christians according to our God-created nature, not only by going to big meetings to listen to one man speak but also by establishing home meetings in the homes of the new ones. This is the only way for the church to have a solid foundation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL FELLOWSHIP AND ADJUSTMENTS</h2>
<p>We need to fellowship concerning a few practical matters. The responsible brothers from each meeting hall should meet together to fellowship concerning how to carry out these points. The elders can then fellowship with the saints in each meeting hall concerning how to enter into this burden.</p>
<p>We should lead the saints according to their age. The elderly brothers and sisters can meet together specifically for prayer. The brothers and sisters who are between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five should knock on doors and lead the home meetings. The church in Taipei is not a small church. If the arrangements and leading are done properly, the church will accomplish many things, but if the arrangements are done poorly, we will waste our time. We need to coordinate together and work together in one accord. We should not expect to succeed in two or three weeks. It will not be easy for the trainees and the brothers and sisters in the church to find the time to coordinate together, because the brothers and sisters have jobs. We need to consider this and experiment until we find a way.</p>
<p>We have a large city and two thousand new households; therefore, we should not waste our time or our manpower. These matters require that the brothers and sisters in each meeting hall coordinate and work together. We must follow the leading and arrangements of the elders and the responsible brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING A WEIGHTY PERSON IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Door-knocking to preach the gospel and having home meetings are noble activities. For this reason we should not do them according to our old ways but according to the instructions of the training. When we go out, our appearance must be proper and our clothing should be simple but neat. Our clothing should not be luxurious, nor should we wear bright colors. Our clothing should cause people to respect us and to consider that we are weighty people. Then people will feel peaceful and welcome us. Otherwise, our appearance can hinder us from entering their door.</p>
<p>We must also be serious people so that we are not despised. First Timothy 4:12 says, &ldquo;Let no one despise your youth.&rdquo; This means that we should be weighty. To be held in high regard requires weight. The weightiness of a Christian depends on the Lord. If we have the Lord in us, we are weighty; if we do not have the Lord in us, we will lack weightiness. The young people can be weighty because the Lord is in them. If they love the Lord and fellowship with Him often, they will be weighty.</p>
<p>Our purpose is not merely to knock on doors in order to bring salvation to others, or to have home meetings in order to bring grace and truth to the new believers. In addition, we must be &ldquo;cultivated&rdquo; persons. Being &ldquo;cultivated,&rdquo; however, does not mean self-improvement. We cannot improve ourselves. We need to fellowship with the Lord daily and have set times to touch the Lord, confess our sins, and pursue the growth in life. We also need to follow the Spirit, deny the self, not seek our own benefit, and bear the cross daily in order to follow the Lord. The Lord is the living Spirit in our spirit. If we live by the Spirit, we will grow and become weighty persons.</p>
<p>We also need a knowledge of the truth. Truth and life are two aspects of the same thing. When the truth enters into us and is digested in our experience, it becomes life to us. We cannot neglect the truth; hence, we must read the Bible often and know the Bible. Life and truth make us weighty persons. In addition to knocking on doors and having home meetings, our appearance and speech must be weighty, and we must grow in life and be equipped in the truth. The Lord, the divine life, and the truth are in us. Consequently, the words we speak will have value.</p>
<p>Many people seemed light rather than weighty before their salvation, even though they were well educated and had a high position in society. After believing in the Lord, however, they began to pray, read the Bible, grow in life, and be transformed. Now they are proper and weighty in their appearance, speech, and relationship with others. This is not the result of human teachings; rather, this is the issue of the increase of the Lord within them.</p>
<p>Every day we need the spiritual exercise of touching the Lord, dealing with Him, giving Him room within us, following Him, bearing the cross, and studying the truth. If we do this every day of the year, we will become weighty persons regardless of our age. We will be weighty when we speak and when we shake hands with people. Even the unbelievers will sense that we have something within that makes us weighty. This is the difference between believers and unbelievers; what we have within us is expressed outside of us.</p>
<p>We are not in a movement. According to <em>Hymns,</em> #268, we are channels for God&rsquo;s Spirit to flow through us into others. If we visit the new ones in their homes every week, what is deposited into them will be with them for the rest of their lives. Even if we answer their questions with a few simple sentences, our answer will remain in the deepest part of their being. They may ask a simple question about dealing with their parents; if we are weighty, even a simple response will give them a deep impression. Our response will change their human life. This is what we must give people when we contact them through door-knocking. We must be prepared to do this.</p>
<p>We cannot learn to be weighty, nor can others teach us. Being weighty requires a daily exercise. We exercise to daily fellowship with the Lord and to avoid committing sins and transgressions. We thoroughly confess every sin and transgression to the Lord so that we can be cleansed by His blood, filled with the Holy Spirit, walk according to the Spirit, and live a life of bearing the cross instead of living to ourselves. We must also read the Bible often and learn the truth. In this way we will become weighty persons. Our being weighty will influence our home meetings. I am concerned that we are not weighty. This can cause people to find some excuse not to meet with us. They may even ask us not to come again.</p>
<p>We should not receive these words as doctrine; we should receive this burden and pray concerning this matter. If we want the Lord to spread His recovery and increase the church, we must be weighty people who walk on this pathway. The home meetings are not a light matter. We are presenting ourselves to others, and they see what we are. Being weighty depends on a habitual daily exercise before the Lord. We should never despise the home meetings. Even if we do not know how to use <em>Life Lessons,</em> what we are is placed before the new ones. If we are proper and weighty, their entire household will be blessed because they see a pattern that can benefit even their children. The new ones will become weighty people who fear God, believe in the Lord Jesus, speak the truth, and are proper. They will even welcome us for the sake of their children. This type of work is worthwhile and long lasting.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">COORDINATING IN ONE ACCORD<br />
TO CARE FOR THE NEW ONES</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You. Thank You that we can be gathered into Your name again. We treasure this time and ask for Your blessing. We pray that You would move among us and have the room to move through every one of us so that You can accomplish Your eternal will. Lord, we look to You to give us a word, Your Spirit, and the anointing. Enlighten us and grant us sight. We pray that You would bless Your church and remember every brother and sister, the home meetings, and every other meeting. We offer our thanksgiving and praise to You. You have led us until now. You are the Lord who leads us, and we bow our heads to worship You. May Your presence be with us. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE FULL-TIME TRAINING</h2>
<p>We will now fellowship concerning the full-time training. Since August 1986 when the first term of the training began, the trainees have baptized more than twenty thousand people who were contacted through door-knocking. Out of these twenty thousand people, more than six thousand have meetings in their homes. Of these six thousand people, nearly four thousand meet with us one or more times a week, and their condition may be considered stable. The remaining two thousand have meetings in their homes at least once a month. The care of all these home meetings is still in the hands of the full-time trainees. Every day they visit and care for these households. Without such care, it is not easy to sustain the newly baptized ones.</p>
<p>In our fellowship with the elders, we expressed the desire to gradually transfer the care of these home meetings to the brothers and sisters in the meeting halls. The transfer cannot be done in a light way. Some of these brothers and sisters have been in the full-time training and are already caring for new ones; hence, it will not be easy for these saints to care for more new ones. In addition, the full-time trainees have been caring for some of the new ones for eight or nine months and for others only one or two months. Hence, some of the new ones are accustomed to the trainees who are caring for them. Therefore, this transfer must be done properly in order to not lose any new ones. Furthermore, the new ones may not be able to accept being cared for by other people.</p>
<p>Therefore, we fellowshipped with the trainees about their burden. Some of the trainees from New Zealand and Europe are willing to stay, but we feel to let them return, because this decision involves the locality they came from. Therefore, we decided that the trainees who wish to remain here must first fellowship with their locality. If their locality is willing to support them, they can stay here for one or two more years. This also applies to the trainees from the localities in Taiwan. Approximately five hundred fifty full-time trainees who have attended two terms of the training are willing to remain. This number includes two hundred fifty trainees from Taipei, one hundred fifty trainees from the localities outside of Taipei, and one hundred fifty trainees from abroad.</p>
<p>The trainees who remain in Taipei will be a strengthening because they will be able to continue caring for the newly baptized saints and to contact people through door-knocking. These trainees were in two terms of the training, and therefore they are all experienced. Hence, if they remain, it will also support the church in Taipei. This is a tremendous strengthening for the growth and spread of the church.</p>
<p>In our fellowship with the elders in Taipei, we asked them to do their best to care for these five hundred fifty trainees and to find lodging for them. These trainees will spend most of their energy to care for the home meetings. We hope that they will be able to build up the new households in one or two years. This will be a tremendous help. All the saints need to know about this situation and receive a burden from the Lord to pray.</p>
<p>At present it seems as if the training will continue every year because there are already more than one thousand university and high school students who have signed up to attend the training. In addition to these students, many saints from other localities have signed up for the training. This is a large number of trainees. It will not be a simple matter to feed these trainees. When we had the largest number of trainees, there were more than one thousand people attending the training and eating meals. We have two kitchens, in hall one and hall three, and about thirty brothers and sisters whose only service is to prepare meals for the training. There are also local saints who come and help with the meals. We thank the Lord that so far all the trainees have been eating well, and the food is healthy. If the training is to continue every year, we must consider the many details related to the training. This is the general situation of the training.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE LARGE MEETING HALL</h2>
<p>Our present need is to obtain a large meeting hall. Our numbers are constantly increasing, and even though we emphasize home meetings, we still need corporate meetings at least once a month. Sometimes the whole church will need to gather together to take care of a need. A few years ago we obtained some property at Linkou and began preparations to build a large meeting hall there. We spoke of the purchase of the property at Linkou in a general way at the end of 1984. After two years of applying for the property, we finally received a formal response from the government. We then had another meeting with the saints, but because we did not want this to be a financial burden on the saints, we gave the example of the meeting hall of the church in Pingtung and asked the saints to make contributions for the building of the meeting hall at Linkou. The saints were happy to receive the burden and made offerings. This enabled us to purchase the property quickly. This piece of land is in a government-protected area for a flood control plan. Therefore, we must wait until the city of Linkou is developed, its population has increased, and the government has completed the flood prevention work before we receive a building permit. This means that we will not obtain a building permit in the near future and that we must temporarily leave that piece of property for later development. We now know that it is difficult to purchase inexpensive land in the outlying areas to build a large meeting hall. Therefore, we must build a large hall within the city of Taipei, but the price of land in the city is high. In order to buy six square feet in the eastern district of Taipei, we need NT$400,000 to $500,000. Thus, this matter must be carried out according to the leading of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING TRAINED AND COORDINATING<br />
IN ONE ACCORD TO KNOCK ON DOORS<br />
AND TO CARE FOR NEW ONES</h2>
<p>If we want to gospelize Taiwan, our first step must be to gain the city of Taipei. The meeting halls continue to set up small meetings in the communities. When there are fifteen to twenty &ldquo;small hall&rdquo; meetings in a community, we can find a hall to meet in. There is a place in Taipei with four hundred saints who were saved through door-knocking. One hundred of these new ones come to the meetings regularly, and another thirty meet regularly in a sister&rsquo;s home. The meeting in the sister&rsquo;s home is just like a meeting in a small hall. There are more than ten meetings like this one that can be called community or district meetings. If we continue step by step, these small hall meetings may eventually establish a regular meeting in a hall.</p>
<p>If possible, it is good for the brothers and sisters to attend the training. If they are not able to attend during the day, they will still receive much benefit from attending the training at night. We need to be trained in everything we do. It is difficult for a person who is not trained to play the piano well. This also applies to sports. We have been practicing the new way for more than two years, and most of the churches around the world are practicing the new way. However, the success of knocking on doors depends on whether the elders are in one accord. If the elders and the saints who knock on doors are in one accord, there will be results.</p>
<p>The elderly brothers and sisters who have been in the church life for many years are experienced, and they have a heart to knock on doors. We hope that when they go out door-knocking, they will stand before the door, in front of the trainees, so that people will feel comfortable to open their doors. However, when it is time to preach the gospel, it is best to let the young people speak, and the older saints should be there to comfort people&rsquo;s hearts and to pray. In this way their function will be effective. Even though the young people cannot compare to the elderly saints in experience and eloquence, the young people who have been trained can calmly meet the need. For example, I was not trained to play the piano; therefore, I cannot play as well as my young granddaughter, even though I have been around pianos from my youth. The elderly brothers and sisters who knock on doors with the trainees should receive this exhortation to stand before the door but to not open their mouths to preach the gospel. When the young people come to the crucial point in the gospel, the elderly saints should not interrupt, even if they fear that the young saints will not do a good job. Any interruption can prevent a person from being saved. Furthermore, even though the young people may speak quickly or may not be so polite, the elderly saints must not become angry. Similarly, the young people should not resent any criticism from the elderly saints. We must not overly emphasize being correct in our speech or being polite. As long as people are saved and baptized, it is very precious.</p>
<p>If all the brothers and sisters pick up this burden, we will not need to spend time on other problems. May the gospel run freely, may people be saved, and may the Lord have a way to go on. We must gospelize Taipei, then Taiwan, and then the entire world. May we all receive this commission.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">CRUCIAL POINTS CONCERNING THE ADVANCE AND PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING FOR THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since we began to change the system to the new way in October 1984, we have released almost fifty messages concerning the practice of the new way. However, because I was busy working on the Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese, I was not able to give the church much leadership or help, nor was I able to give much help to the full-time training. If the Lord allows, we will use the next four months to lead the church in Taipei. We will not hold message meetings or training meetings.</p>
<p>During the last two and a half years our labor was concentrated on the young people. Last summer we spent all our energy on a college conference and training, and about ten days ago we had a special gospel meeting for the young people in a stadium. The stadium had seating for eleven thousand, but fifteen to sixteen thousand young people came to the meeting. There were thirteen thousand high school students present. In addition, one hundred fifty people were baptized. This was the result of the work among the young people. Even though we did a good job, we should not be proud. Paul said that we do not have anything that we did not receive. Therefore, we should not be proud (1 Cor. 4:7).</p>
<p>The church in Taipei has neglected the elderly saints, the working saints, and the housewives. We need to make up for this lack and meet with these saints. In the meantime, the trainees will go to the campuses to gain students. Recently the trainees have been saying that the fire of the gospel on the campuses is of eternal value. The trainees will spend the next six months preaching the gospel on the campuses. They want to baptize one-tenth of the university students in Taipei into the Lord Jesus. The young people are full of potential. If they begin to run on the new way, none of us will be able to keep up with them. The campus work is truly of eternal value. We should all rejoice because the young people&rsquo;s work is full of hope.</p>
<p>We will meet with the elderly saints and the working saints because we have neglected them. We must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning these meetings. We will meet for four or five weeks or even longer. In any event, we must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Please pray for this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORLD SITUATION<br />
WORKING FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h2>
<p>In 1984 we began to change the system to the new way because we saw a clear picture in the Bible concerning the proper church life. We also examined the world situation in light of the prophecies in the Bible that we had studied in the past. In 1962 I began the work in America. The following year I pointed out that according to the prophecies in the Bible, the world situation will eventually come to the day when the whole world is focused on the Middle East, because everyone will depend on the Middle East for oil. In 1973 there was a global oil crisis.</p>
<p>Today the situation in the Middle East is the object of concern to the entire world. We may also become anxious after reading about certain situations in the world. Even though we may become anxious, we should take heed to the prophetic word, because it is like a lamp shining in a dark place (2 Pet. 1:19). We have the prophetic word, which shines as a lamp in the night. Hence, we do not need to walk in darkness. We have light; we are not like the people in the world.</p>
<p>In 1958 I was invited to give conferences in England and Denmark, and I visited some countries in Europe. In Denmark I visited a few saints who did not have a clear view of the world situation and who therefore had the concept that Taiwan&rsquo;s situation was not favorable. Everything that I said to them in fellowship has become a fact of history. Taiwan is standing strong and is recognized by all the civilized countries in the world. Taiwan has even become one of the leading economic countries in Asia. We are truly in the last days, and we must be faithful to continue in the way that the Lord has given us. We must see that the Lord wants to move quickly in these days and that we need to endeavor to cooperate with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENTIRE EARTH BEING OPEN<br />
TO THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>There is another point that we should pay attention to. According to our observations, during the past two thousand years of church history the gospel work was able to gain only small areas. Hudson Taylor went to China, but he was able to gain only the interior of China, and the missionaries who went to Africa gained only isolated places in Africa. In contrast, today all six continents are open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the work of the gospel in every country, we recently translated the booklet <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> into thirty-six different languages. This means that if one thousand brothers and sisters are trained in the truth, are experienced in the divine life, and know some languages, they can take <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> all over the world to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>All of South America is open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. There are about two hundred localities in the country of Brazil, and the countries in Central America are open to us. Countries are opening to us, not just cities. Mexico and Puerto Rico are open to us. West Africa, North Africa, East Africa, and South Africa are open to us. If we could send one to two hundred brothers and sisters to Africa, they would help to meet the need. Europe, Australia, and New Zealand are also open to us. The entire earth is open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN TAIWAN<br />
PAVING THE WAY FOR THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In the past, people in the West received different impressions concerning the Chinese people. They mainly knew that China has a large population. They also considered the Chinese to be unskilled workers, because the Chinese who immigrated to America were mostly illiterate country people. Many of these immigrants worked in the gold mines in America, and some of them opened Chinese restaurants. In addition, the Western missionaries, who brought the gospel and the Bible to China, took pictures and gave reports on the negative aspect of Chinese culture, such as opium smoking and foot binding. For example, most of the pictures in a book written by Hudson Taylor show people shooting morphine, smoking opium, and binding women&rsquo;s feet. As a result of these pictures that were published more than one hundred years ago, some people in America still have a bad impression of Chinese people.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, when I first began the work in America, I spent the first three or four years traveling from the East Coast to the West Coast and from the South to the North. I often stayed with typical American families who lived in small towns. These believers always commented that they had never seen a Chinese person like me, and I always responded that there are many Chinese people like me. At that time not many students from Taiwan were studying in America, but now there are students from Taiwan all over America, and the Americans know that the Chinese have excellent minds. The Americans are now open to the Chinese. Moreover, the exports and foreign currency reserves of Taiwan have surprised everyone, and the rapid development of Taiwan&rsquo;s economy has caused all the countries in the world to change their concept of Taiwan. This is for the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p>
<p>Hence, we need to train and send out thousands of young people to Africa, Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and other parts of the world. The young people must also equip themselves; they should not only study English but also learn a third language such as Spanish, German, French, Japanese, or Korean. Moreover, they should learn enough Greek to be able to use reference books. Some people consider Greek to be a difficult language, but anything that is honorable and worthwhile is not easy. Any young person who has a heart to consecrate himself to the Lord must study languages. The Lord&rsquo;s move today is accelerated, and we must cooperate with Him.</p>
<p>The Lord is advancing in Taiwan. We have never had a city in which more than one hundred full-time serving ones preached the word. For the first time the church in Taipei has six hundred full-time serving ones. Furthermore, we had our first meeting with more than fifteen thousand young people. About two weeks ago we invited all the young people in the churches in Taiwan to attend a summer young people&rsquo;s conference. More than twenty buses carrying over one thousand people came from one locality in central Taiwan. The smaller towns and villages sent four or five hundred people. This was the Lord&rsquo;s move, and it proves that the churches on the island of Taiwan have potential. This potential has not been released in more than twenty years.</p>
<p>Three or five full-time preachers or serving ones cannot do that much. Even three to five hundred full-time serving ones cannot meet our need. The Lord&rsquo;s move must be accelerated because the Jews have regained their country; the fig tree that was cursed and withered has become tender and put forth its leaves. However, Matthew 24:14 says that the gospel of the kingdom must be preached in the whole inhabited earth before the end comes. Who will go out to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth? Many college students are willing to answer the Lord&rsquo;s call and preach the gospel on the campuses. The campuses are their Jerusalem (Acts 1:8); hence, they must begin with the campuses. The working saints and the elderly saints have their Jerusalem in Taipei. Hence, we must strengthen the visitation service so that the gospel can be spread to every home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EARLY CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>We are clearer today concerning the proper church life than we were in the past. According to the revelation we received from the Lord, God desires to gain a group of redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people to be the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression and testimony on the earth. We are that group of people.</p>
<p>We are different from traditional Christianity. Therefore, we must forget and discard everything that we learned from Christianity along with its methods, because these things are not according to the revelation in the Bible. According to the Bible three thousand people were baptized on the day of Pentecost. This was the work of the Holy Spirit; it was not the result of human methods. Hence, we should not consider it strange for three thousand people to be saved.</p>
<p>Even though three thousand and then five thousand people were baptized in the early church (2:41; 4:4), the believers did not spread. Therefore, God allowed an environment that forced the believers to scatter from Jerusalem to other regions for the preaching of the gospel (8:1, 4). Acts 8:4 says, &ldquo;Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing the word as the gospel.&rdquo; These believers preached the word of God as the gospel. The young people need to hear this word. We do not know how many believers were scattered, nor do we know what they ate or where they lived. However, we do know that wherever they went, people were saved. Even the Samaritans, who were a mixture of Gentile and Jewish blood, were greatly blessed. A group of believers, not a group of preachers, went out. They were disciples, and they did not go to places with chapels, gospel halls, or large cathedrals. Wherever they went, they could rely only on the opening of their mouths to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>The disciples had meetings in the homes of the people who believed in the Lord; they had home meetings. We believe that later some homes joined together to have a small group meeting and that the group meetings joined together to form a district meeting. Every city had home meetings, small group meetings, and district meetings. The people who were saved loved the Lord, and they gave everything that they had for Him. They were the Lord&rsquo;s testimony. Furthermore, Acts shows us another meeting. In Acts 20:7 the whole church met together to break bread and to hear a word from the apostle Paul. Instead of going from house to house to speak a word of light, revelation, and vision, the apostle spoke in this gathering. This meeting is what we call a big meeting.</p><h2 class="head1">TRADITIONAL MEETINGS<br />
KILLING EVERYONE&rsquo;S FUNCTION</h2>
<p>There are still brothers and sisters who are not willing to meet in the homes, because they feel that the home meetings lack flavor and are small and troublesome. Many saints still prefer the methods and traditions of Christianity; these saints are holding on to the big meetings. Every Sunday Christians go to a building, whether it is called a chapel or a meeting hall, to sit and listen to others sing hymns, read the Bible, and speak the Word. This practice binds the believers because they do not need to function. Hence, after a period of time the believers lose their function.</p>
<p>This was also our situation. Consequently, the new believers we gained knew only how to meet in the meeting halls after they were baptized. They did not have the concept of functioning in the meetings, because they felt that they did not know the Bible and that they lacked spiritual experience. Therefore, they could only sit and listen, not speak. We also have saints who feel that after working six days a week, they should come to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting to listen to a message and relax. If we require these saints to function, they may feel that they are being pressured by the church and may no longer want to attend the meetings.</p>
<p>Since we changed the system, we have fellowshipped this burden many times. We also arranged for all the brothers and sisters to be in home meetings. However, some of the home meetings have lost their momentum because the saints who usually speak in these meetings are knocking on doors to preach the gospel, and the remaining saints in the home meetings do not usually speak. This was the church&rsquo;s arrangement in order for one-fourth of the saints to go out door-knocking. As a result, the home meetings and the small groups lost the people who usually speak, and they lost their momentum. This is our current situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOME MEETINGS BEING OUR PRESENT NEED</h2>
<p>This situation shows that a desire to strengthen the big meetings only is wrong. We need to see that the Christian life begins from the home and that every brother and sister must have a home meeting to be a strong Christian. In the past we focused on big meetings, and we did not care for the homes. As a result, our new ones did not receive sufficient care. We all need normal home meetings even if we meet only once a week. An entire family should gather together for a meeting. This is not a formal worship service in the home; rather, it is to make our families living and full of vitality. The husband may say Hallelujah, the wife, Amen, and the children, praise the Lord. They do not need to speak a special word. They need only to exercise their spirit for half an hour, and the entire family will be living.</p>
<p>Some sisters genuinely love the Lord. However, the more these sisters love the Lord, the more difficult it is for their children to be saved. This is because these sisters care only for the Lord; they do not care for their children. If we want our children to be well behaved and receive good grades in school, we must spend time with them. For example, we may not be able to say much concerning the economy of God, but we will gradually learn to say something by attending the home meetings. In a home meeting someone may ask, &ldquo;What verse in the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s economy?&rdquo; Another person may answer, &ldquo;Ephesians 3 speaks of God&rsquo;s economy.&rdquo; Then a young brother can open the New Testament and read Ephesians 3:9-10 to everyone. At the end of the meeting someone else may suggest that everyone sing a hymn. This is a home meeting.</p>
<p>Some of the brothers and sisters do not speak and others do. This is the situation in every locality. A brother who works in a hospital testified recently that one hundred fifty saints work as doctors, nurses, and staff in the same hospital. Before we started the home meetings, these one hundred fifty saints did not function, but since the home meetings began, these saints have been functioning. They started meeting in different homes, and presently three to five households gather together. They do not need to determine beforehand what they will speak about, nor do they appoint a leader. They simply come together to exercise their spirit and overthrow the system of everyone listening to one speaker. By meeting in this way, they are enlivened.</p>
<p>When everyone is together, they exercise their spirit and say Hallelujah, Amen, praise the Lord. In addition, everyone also says something briefly concerning God&rsquo;s economy. Such a meeting is sweet and rich. In the past we had traditional meetings in which everyone was silent and buried their function. Whoever went to the meeting buried his function. For this reason, we did not want the new ones to go to the big meetings. We were concerned that in the big meetings the new ones would be infected with &ldquo;germs&rdquo; and die.</p>
<p>The people in the communities whom we brought to salvation through door-knocking do not know the practices of traditional Christianity. After they were saved, they immediately began to have home meetings. Their children and wives testify and pray, and they even lead the hymn singing. In the home meetings the new ones can do everything. In this way the new ones are led to experience Christ. If we bring them to the meetings in the meeting hall, they will see that only one person speaks, and everyone else listens and nods their head. This will trouble the new ones. For this reason, we did not encourage the saints to bring the new ones to the big meetings.</p>
<p>Our former way of meeting became an old habit, but now the Lord is leading us forward. We have seen new light and a new practice; hence, we should adjust our present situation. We cannot continue with the big meetings of the past, in which everyone comes together on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to listen to one brother give a message. We must all have home meetings, small group meetings, district meetings, and even big meetings, and we must all exercise to speak in these meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF THE GOSPEL REVIVALS<br />
OF TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>Since the time of the Reformation of Martin Luther, most of the gospel revivals in Christianity eventually were followed by a situation of death. At the beginning of the twentieth century, in 1904, there was a great revival in Wales in Great Britain. The leader of the revival was a worker in the coal mines. As a result of this revival, the theaters closed, and no one went to the sports events. The gospel was preached to such an extent that there was no place left to preach the gospel, because everyone was saved. This was a genuine revival. However, in less than thirty years the situation in Wales became cold and dead with no signs of the revival. Even though the gospel fever had reached a peak, only a few decades later almost no one in the second generation remained.</p>
<p>The revival in Wales is not the only example. Every gospel revival has had the same result. The Pentecostal movement began in America and was brought to China. A Chinese pastor in the southern part of Shantung Province joined the Pentecostals and led the Chinese Pentecostal movement from 1929 to 1930. There were many miracles, and they spread throughout northern China within a short time. However, by 1933 the Pentecostal movement no longer existed in most parts of northern China. Regretfully, this is the result of all revivals.</p>
<p>During the time of the Reformation, Protestantism began to emphasize the letter of the law and ordinances; therefore, the Lord raised up a group of believers in the Catholic Church in the 1600s called the mystics. Madame Guyon, who focused on the inner life, was one of these believers. Fifty years ago we received much spiritual help from their writings, and we translated some of their books. One of the books we translated was the autobiography of Madame Guyon. Today, however, not many in Christianity know about the mystics. Later, a group of people who emphasized the inner life continued the line of truth taught by the mystics, and they were prevailing for a period of time. We also received much help from these believers. The prominent believers of this group were William Law and Andrew Murray. However, even in America not many believers are interested in the writings of the inner-life believers.</p>
<p>As we study church history, we see that the way of the denominations is dead because they abandoned the home meetings and the small group meetings. If the home meetings and the small group meetings are healthy, the churches will not die; on the contrary, they will be living. Some Communist countries appear to be closed to Christianity. However, even though the missionaries have left these countries, there is still a small number of local believers who suffer persecution. Persecution does not cause the number of believers in these countries to decrease, because these believers meet in home meetings and small group meetings. They do not have pastors or preachers; they have only the small members. Everyone preaches in the homes and speaks in the homes. This is the way the gospel is spread.</p>
<p>Christianity has tried every method, but eventually the result was death. We are not an exception to this. In October 1984 we began to change the system because we saw our deadened condition. Changing the system was a revolution, but we were not overthrowing other people&rsquo;s lives; we were overthrowing our own lives. We must change. The young ones must change, and the older ones must change. We love the Lord and the church, but we are still unable to lead people to salvation. This is our situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE STUDYING THE TRUTH<br />
IN THE HOME MEETINGS AND THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The saints who are not in the meetings do not have peace, but if the meetings are held in the old way, the saints will not receive the supply to maintain them in their life and work. According to the old way, even after listening to messages for twenty to thirty years, the saints can only sit and listen to more messages. The saints have listened to too many messages. We must no longer remain in this situation. The Lord needs to gain a group of people who have intimate fellowship with Him and who live before Him. Furthermore, these people should have a meeting with their family at least once a week. They should also contact other families once a week or at least every other week and meet with the families they contact. In these meetings they should not merely sing hymns and praise the Lord; they should also study the truth together.</p>
<p>Shortly after we changed the system, we encouraged the saints to read <em>Truth Lessons.</em> Every lesson in <em>Truth Lessons</em> contains an outline and text that explains the outline. These lessons should not be read in a dead and formal way. Instead, we should read the lessons in a living way; we should pray-read them, read with emphasis, with repetition, with explanations, and even read them by singing. We need to use different ways for the contents of <em>Truth Lessons</em> to enter into us.</p>
<p>In the past the saints only listened to messages in the meetings. They listened to messages for thirty years but were unable to speak the truth. This can be compared to a person who goes to school for thirty years but still does not know simple arithmetic. It is difficult for a student to retain anything if he only listens to famous lecturers at school but is not required to do any homework. Our old method of meeting was unable to educate the saints. We must change our habit because it cannot meet the need.</p>
<p>We need to live before the Lord by fellowshipping with Him and studying the truth. The Lord &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (1 Tim. 2:4). We need to know the Lord&rsquo;s new way. In the new way we gained many new ones through knocking on doors. If we want these new ones to remain, we must take proper care of them. This requires that we have home meetings. In addition, we need to read <em>Truth Lessons</em> in the small group meetings. We need to teach the truth so that everyone learns the truth. If we do this, we will spontaneously be able to speak the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, and we will be able to clearly expound justification and sanctification. There is no need for us to speak like a famous evangelist and give a long message. We simply need to speak in an ordinary way and explain that justification is God considering sinners to be righteous according to His standard of righteousness based on the redemption of Christ. It would be wonderful for all the saints to learn to speak in this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONTINUING STEADFASTLY TO PRACTICE<br />
ALL THE ITEMS OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Concerning knocking on doors, the saints may be able to go out every day for two or three weeks, but for the long run they will not be able to go out every day. Hence, we must fellowship concerning what to do for the long run. We need to develop the habit of using at least one evening a week either to preach the gospel by door-knocking or to care for the new ones in their home. We need to be persistent and do these things continually. If every saint baptizes two people every three months, we will be able to baptize eight people a year. However, we should not be too quick and baptize too many people. We must be sure that we can care for the new ones in a home meeting after their salvation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, as long as we all go out once a week to knock on doors, every saint should be able to baptize eight people a year. It may be that only two of the eight will remain and the remaining six will not remain, that is, that only one-fourth will remain. With this rate of growth, we will triple in one year. We should consider this. In our old way of meeting, it was not easy for us to gain one person in eight to ten years, and the ones whom we did gain did not always remain. With the new way, however, if we build up the habit of going out to contact people every week, in one year we can gain eight people, and one-fourth of these eight people, that is, two people, should remain. This is a two hundred percent rate of increase.</p>
<p>May the Lord gain a group of people among us who love Him, fellowship with Him, live before Him, experience Him daily, speak for Him, and speak Him forth when they come to the meetings. For this to happen, we must exercise to constantly live in fellowship with the Lord, to live and act before Him, and to labor upon Him so that we will be able to speak for Him in the meetings.</p>
<p>We must first meet in home meetings and then in small group meetings. In the small group meetings we should speak to one another about what we gained in our fellowship with the Lord and in our experience of Him. It may be that we are touched by the Lord after reading Matthew 18:20 in the morning. Then later in the day when we are in our small group meeting, we may speak with the saints and say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, this morning I read Matthew 18:20, where it speaks of being gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, and I really appreciate the Lord&rsquo;s words. I feel that in our meeting we are gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name, and we are enjoying His presence. I also feel that when I come here to be with you, I am being gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name and I enjoy His presence.&rdquo; This may seem like an ordinary word, but if we all speak such a short, ordinary word, our speaking will be full of flavor. This should be our living.</p>
<p>In addition to the home meetings and the small group meetings, we also need to attend larger meetings, in which we either study the truth or listen to the testimonies of other saints in order to obtain a supply. If all the saints function in this way, the church will be living.</p>
<p>We have no intention of canceling the big meetings, but the church must have many different kinds of meetings. We need home meetings, small group meetings, district meetings, meetings in the halls, and meetings in which the entire church gathers together. If we have a large meeting facility, we can do many things and have different kinds of meetings there every week. May we all endeavor to meet in this way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EVERYONE DILIGENTLY LEARNING<br />
THE TRUTH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FAILURE OF CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the failure of Christianity over the past two thousand years. This failure lies in the fact that only &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speakers speak in their meetings, and the audience does nothing but listen. This can be compared to a person being required only to listen to famous teachers at school. He listens in elementary school, high school, college, and even in graduate school, but he does not do any work on his own. The end result is that he can do nothing. He may have listened to lectures on chemistry, mathematics, and other subjects, but he has gained nothing and consequently has no usefulness.</p>
<p>Many among us have been saved for a long time and have been meeting regularly. However, not many can clearly speak the truth. Not many can give a clear word on the parts of man, the function of each part, or even the difference between justification and sanctification. Our continual listening to &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speakers has caused us to become loose in our life practices and to lose our pursuit in the truth. The result of our listening to famous speakers is that we do not endeavor to study the truth. We have wasted our time and have gained nothing. This is our failure.</p>
<p>For this reason we are determined to change the system, but this is not easy to accomplish. We have raised up numerous churches during the past fifty years, and we have learned much from our observation and experience. Without a doubt all the saints love the Lord, the church, and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. By 1984, however, we saw that the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, whether in Taiwan or in America, had become lukewarm. The church in Taipei has decreased in number instead of increasing. In spite of all the faithful labor, there is no result. This is also the situation in all of Christianity. Our practice has been wrong. We should not have allowed the brothers and sisters to always listen to famous speakers. We need to attend classes and study. I hope that the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would not be Christians who only listen to famous speakers; rather, we would be Christians who attend classes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR EDUCATION</h2>
<p>The best example that proves the success of education is Taiwan. It is difficult to find a society as stable, prosperous, abundant in knowledge, and excellent in manpower as Taiwan. The primary reason for this situation is the availability of education. Many people have received higher education and are able to develop products that can compete in the world market. As a result, many riches have been brought to this country. This accomplishment has caused much admiration among Westerners.</p>
<p>When we built the workers&rsquo; home in 1954, we imported flush toilets from abroad because plumbing equipment in Taiwan was outdated. The flush toilets presently used in Taiwan, however, are more advanced than those in America. Success in education has enabled Taiwan to achieve what it was unable to achieve thirty years ago. Over the past thirty years, the people in Taiwan have become educated, and their knowledge has developed. If this can happen in a nation, it can happen in the church. Everything in Taiwan today is advanced, but everything in the church is still according to the old way. Even though the Lord has blessed us abundantly, we delay Him because we maintain our old ways. It is reasonable for us to maintain our strong points, but to maintain our old practices is a dreadful and serious mistake. Therefore, whether we are young or old, we need to change. First, we need a change in concept, and second, we need a change in practice. We must all start afresh to learn.</p>
<p>The practice in Christianity has unconsciously bound all the saints. This practice requires the saints only to attend a Sunday service and give a monetary offering. Such a practice annuls the function of the saints and edifies only the preachers. We may say that we do not have this practice among us, but the principle of everyone listening to a &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speaker is equivalent to this practice. The brothers and sisters have developed the habit of sitting in the meetings and listening to gifted brothers give messages. This habit annuls the gift we have received from the Lord. We have all been regenerated by the Lord and have His life. This life brings us a gift as our function. This can be compared to a newborn baby who has a complete set of internal organs. Having a complete set of organs does not mean that the baby is fully developed in function. It simply means that the baby has complete organs. As the baby grows, the function of each organ will be manifested. Function is the issue of the growth in life. When a child grows to a certain stage, he will begin to speak, and when he reaches another stage, he can learn to read. This also applies to the gift a person receives when he is regenerated; the function of the gift is manifested through his growth in life.</p>
<p>We are living Christians. Since we have been regenerated and have God&rsquo;s life in us, we should grow in life in order for our function to be manifested. If after two years a child cannot speak, his mother will worry even to the extent of losing her appetite, because she is concerned that the child might be dumb. Our practice in the churches has made people dumb. Many saints in the churches have listened to messages for decades and have become dumb because they do not speak. On the contrary, many young people like to speak, but they do not have any content. Hence, the crucial point is not merely to speak but to speak with content. This depends on education.</p><h2 class="head1">RECEIVING EDUCATION AND LEARNING THE TRUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Reading Two Verses in the Bible Every Day<br />
to Enter into the Word of the Lord</h2>
<p>The whole world would be in darkness if God had not given us the Bible. We each have a Bible in our hand, but not many of us are diligently learning the truth. If we want to grow in life and use our gift to supply others, we need to be educated by diligently learning the truth. A certain sister was over fifty years old and illiterate when she was saved. Over the past twenty years, however, her ability to read Chinese has improved, especially her ability to read the Bible. Since education has become more available, fewer people are illiterate. Hence, we should endeavor to learn the truth in the Bible, beginning with the Gospel of Matthew. If we read only two verses every morning, we would read 730 verses in a year and 7,300 verses in ten years. The New Testament has a total of 27 books, consisting of 7,957 verses in 260 chapters. If all of us would practice reading two verses every day, we would read every verse and every word of the New Testament in less than eleven years.</p>
<p>For example, we can begin from the Gospel of Matthew: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers&rdquo; (1:1-2). Five to eight minutes are enough to read these verses with emphasis and to pray-read them. We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we do not have time. We are not required to spend thirty minutes or an hour reading. How can we say that we do not have five to eight minutes to read every morning? When we rise in the morning, it is best not to immediately occupy ourselves with washing up or getting dressed. Rather, we should first read two verses for the day and try to remember them. Then while we are washing up, we can speak these verses again and again. Even while the sisters are preparing breakfast, they can pray-read these verses. In this way no one can say that he is unable to learn the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Repeating the Lord&rsquo;s Words Continually<br />
during the Day to Keep Them in Our Heart<br />
and Speak Them to Others</h2>
<p>In addition to reading the Bible in the morning, we can read the Bible as we ride the bus to work or to school. Hence, we should have a Bible with us. If we do not have a Bible with us, we can consider the verses we pray-read in the morning. This is a beneficial practice that will enable us to keep the Lord&rsquo;s words in our heart. Even when we are at work, we can consider the verses we read. If we would learn the truth in this way, we will be able to clearly explain what is justification and what is sanctification. We can all learn this.</p>
<p>There was an elderly brother in Nanking who was a pastor when he was young. Since his memory was quite poor when he was eighty, his family had to lock him inside the house for fear that he would become lost if he left the house. I am now older than he was at that time, but most people admire my good memory. The secret to my memory is that I treasure the Bible and read it diligently. I am very familiar with every chapter and every verse of the Bible. The portions that I read in my youth are more familiar than ever to me, and I will never forget them. Therefore, the older saints should take courage. As long as we read two verses a day and repeat them during the day, we will not forget them. Not only so, we will finish the entire New Testament in less than eleven years by reading two verses a day. How wonderful this is! This is to learn the truth.</p>
<p>If all the brothers and sisters can learn the truth in this way, they will speak out of the abundance within them. Many brothers and sisters have been Christians for more than thirty years, but they have never spoken in a meeting. Suddenly they are being told to speak in the home meetings, and they do not know where to begin. Therefore, we are now undertaking an educational program. Now that we are changing the system, we will begin meetings to read <em>Truth Lessons.</em> If the young people in a country do not receive a basic education, the country will never become rich and strong. The result of being uneducated is either poverty or barbarity. Where there is no education, there is no civilization.</p>
<p>When I was young, my mother sent me to an English school to learn English. I believe that was the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement for me to receive a foundational training in English. I was in my sixties when I went to America. Before that time, I had never studied or lived in America. Many Americans were surprised that I could give messages in English. Without a foundation in English, however, even if I was filled with spiritual knowledge and divine truths, I would only be dumb, speechless, in Western countries.</p>
<p>We all love the Lord and like to speak for the Lord, but what do we speak and how do we speak? We need an adequate knowledge of the truth, and then as persons belonging to God and seeking the Lord, we will have wisdom and knowledge through the Lord&rsquo;s word to know what to speak and how to speak to people. In 1933, in my first trip away from home, I went to Shanghai to meet with Brother Watchman Nee. After a short time Brother Nee asked me to stay in Shanghai and entrusted me with the ministry of the word. At that time I spoke the Chefoo dialect, and I did not know how to serve in an environment where everyone spoke the Shanghai dialect. This is a matter of education. Since I exercised to give messages in Mandarin and use proper words when I spoke, all the brothers and sisters understood me. As a result, all the saints, young and old, brother and sister, came to see me with problems regarding their family, jobs, and school. I was able to handle the language difference and the problems concerning the truth.</p><h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM TO LEARN THE TRUTH<br />
AND TO MEET THE NEED OF THE WHOLE EARTH</h2>
<p>The purpose of changing the system is so that every brother and sister will learn the truth. If any of the older saints are sixty years old and begin reading two verses from the Bible a day, they will only be seventy-one years old when they finish reading the New Testament, and they will still be very useful to the Lord. As a short-term benefit, if we read two verses a day, what we read will become very useful by the time we begin a home meeting in six months. We also hope to see the young generation gained by the Lord in this age.</p>
<p>Presently, there are about one thousand churches on six continents. The whole world is open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, because the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has the proper ground and is full of the truth. Five hundred young saints who can speak Spanish and who can go to Central and South America would not be enough to meet the needs there. There is a need everywhere&mdash;in the United States, Canada, East Africa, West Africa, South Africa, and North Africa. Therefore, we must learn the truth. We should not take the easy way of listening to &ldquo;famous&rdquo; speakers. We need to take classes and be educated by learning the Bible word by word and item by item. If we practice this, we will achieve a definite educational standard in twenty years.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHANGING THE SYSTEM BEING RELATED TO<br />
CONTACTING THE LORD EVERY MORNING</h2>
<p>Changing the system is to help us to speak for the Lord; hence, we must cooperate. Previously, the brothers and sisters came to the meeting hall for morning watch every morning. We do not deny that having morning watch corporately is helpful. However, it is not sufficient to have morning watch without fellowshipping with the Lord in His presence. The blessing we receive from having corporate morning watch can never replace the personal contact we have with the Lord. We need to spend five to ten minutes to contact the Lord every morning. No matter how busy we are, we should grasp every opportunity to contact the Lord. Even while we bathe or take a walk, we can consider and meditate on the verses we read. This will be a great benefit to us. We should not contact any person, thing, or matter before we contact the Lord in the morning. This practice is included in our learning the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A RESOLUTION TO LEARN THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We need to make a resolution to learn the truth. We should not say, &ldquo;It is useless to make a resolution, because the result will be as Paul says: &lsquo;To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.&rsquo;&rdquo; The Lord who is living in us will help us. Everything depends on whether we are willing to learn. The Lord said to Jerusalem, &ldquo;I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!&rdquo; (Matt. 23:37). Now the Lord is asking us, &ldquo;Will you contact Me for a few minutes every morning? Will you pray-read two verses? Will you learn <em>Truth Lessons</em> in the church meetings?&rdquo; Many people can testify that reading any kind of book, newspaper, or magazine cannot compare with reading the Bible. At my present age, I am still alert and sharp without any confusion because I have the words of the Lord in me all the time; His words in me are everything to me. I have joy whenever I read the Bible. Reading the Bible is good medicine for healing. The Lord&rsquo;s word is the factor of our happiness. If we speak the Lord&rsquo;s word every day, we will be healthy.</p>
<p>It is even more necessary for the older brothers and sisters to learn the truth. If we know the truth, we can teach our children and grandchildren, and when they live with us, our conduct and behavior will be proper. If the tongue of a grandfather is the pen of a ready writer (Psa. 45:1) and that home is filled with a scholarly atmosphere, the children and grandchildren who are living together will benefit greatly even if they have little contact with the grandfather. Similarly, the most basic requirement for all the brothers and sisters in the church to manifest their function is to learn and know the truth. Without an education in the truth, it is difficult for us to develop or manifest our function. This is the problem in today&rsquo;s Christianity, and it is also a big lack among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">USING <em>TRUTH LESSONS</em> TO LEARN THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>I hope that after such fellowship, we will all learn the truth. The Lord has prepared <em>Truth Lessons</em> for us, and it is the best means for us to learn the truth. In order to use <em>Truth Lessons,</em> we must be prepared before we come to the meeting. There will be no need for us to pray as we did in the past: &ldquo;Lord, today Brother So-and-so will speak the message. Please strengthen him so that his words will penetrate our hearts. O Lord, touch all the brothers and sisters so that they will come to listen to the message.&rdquo; Such prayers are for listening to famous speakers; they are not prayers for the brothers and sisters to speak in the meetings. Instead, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I will learn the truth. Lord, bring new ones to us so that we can learn the truth together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should not come to the meeting with the expectation of listening to a speech. When we come to a meeting, we should not wait for someone to lead us. When it is time to begin, we can open <em>Truth Lessons</em> and read. We do not even need to wait until everyone is present. When the latecomers arrive, they can join in the reading. During the meeting we can read with emphasis; we can also pray-read and sing-read. All the brothers and sisters should open their mouths. We should change our old concepts and not long for messages given by famous, eloquent speakers who use good stories and examples. We no longer have famous speakers. Every one of us is a small member, and none of us can speak well. Nevertheless, we cannot sit in a meeting and look at each other. We should exercise to call hymns and read the lessons. Everything should be carried out by the brothers and sisters themselves. We can give testimonies, pray, and pray-read. Such a meeting in which everyone functions is much better than a meeting by a famous speaker. May all the gatherings in the churches in Taiwan be like this in two or three years. May every gathering be living, with everyone speaking. We do not have idle talk in the meetings; neither do we consider everyday matters. In the meetings we speak concerning the Lord, the truth, and the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL EDUCATION IN THE TRUTH BEING<br />
THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SERVICE TO PEOPLE</h2>
<p>If we desire to be useful to the Lord, we must learn the truth. Truth is the foundation. To preach the gospel, we need to learn the truth; to speak with others, we need to learn the truth; to help others, we also need to learn the truth. If we do not know the truth, when people come to us with a problem concerning their marriage, we can only say, &ldquo;Our God is almighty. Pray and trust Him more. He will definitely save you.&rdquo; If someone seeks our help concerning his business, we will also say, &ldquo;God is almighty. As long as you trust in Him, He will surely help you.&rdquo; Regardless of the person, matter, or situation, we will always give the same answer. What help can we render? However, if we have sufficient knowledge of the truth, when people encounter a problem, we can speak to them according to the word of the truth that pertains to their particular problem. We can even strengthen the word with examples or experiences from the people in the Bible. If we do this, we will render genuine help to others. We should no longer use clich&#233;s to say things that do not even touch the point.</p>
<p>For example, when a sister has a problem with her husband, we should speak to her according to the word of the truth. Afterward we should wait for her response and listen to what she says. We can then strengthen her by telling her the story of Ruth in the Old Testament. In this way she will receive help and be able to resolve the problem with her husband. If a brother speaks to us concerning his business, we should fellowship with him according to the truth. Whether we can render genuine help to people depends on whether we are clear concerning the truth. Therefore, we must have the spiritual education of the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAKING A SCHEDULE AND<br />
PRACTICING ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE</h2>
<p>We should make a schedule for the seven days of the week, that begins with rising in the morning and ends with going to bed in the evening. The schedule should include our daily activities. Because we have our own circumstances, we should make our own schedule. This schedule will naturally reflect the specifics of our circumstances. If we love the Lord and pursue the Lord, we should make a schedule and practice according to our schedule. Otherwise, we will not succeed.</p>
<p>Certain things must be included in our schedule. There must be a time to contact the Lord daily, whether it is five, ten, or fifteen minutes. We should have a fixed time to have fellowship with the Lord daily. In our contact with the Lord, we must confess our sins. Perhaps we have committed many sins unconsciously, yet we have no feeling concerning them. However, when we fellowship with the Lord and He points out those matters and rebukes us, we should confess all the sins we are inwardly conscious of, one by one. We should confess our sins every day. Even though we have confessed our sins in the morning, if we become weak before noon, we should confess our sins again at noontime. Daily confession keeps our conscience pure and removes any barrier between us and the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should constantly turn to the Lord. We should say to the Lord, &ldquo;I truly believe in You. You are the Spirit, and You are filling me inwardly. Fill me now, Lord, like the air filling my whole being.&rdquo; We should believe with our whole heart that the Lord lives in us and that what we speak through faith has authority, power, and boldness. Our schedule must include these three things, and we must practice them. We must fellowship with the Lord daily, confess our sins, and ask the Lord to fill us with Himself. From today forward, we should endeavor to learn the truth, and we should exercise to have a schedule. We should not feel that this is difficult. We are absolutely sure that as long as we practice step by step according to our schedule, we will walk in peace. If we practice these matters with persistence, considering them as part of our daily life, we will see the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE REVIVAL OF THE CHURCH<br />
IN PHILADELPHIA</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 3:1-6, 8, 15-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCHES SPOKEN OF<br />
IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION</h2>
<p>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 can be divided into two groups: the first group consists of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, and Thyatira. Thyatira represents the Roman Catholic Church. The second group consists of Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. The course of the second group began at the time of the Reformation with Martin Luther, which brought in a revival to the church. It continued into the nineteenth century when the church in Philadelphia, a revived church, was raised up. The word <em>philadelphia</em> means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; The church, however, fell from her revived condition to become the church in Laodicea. It is difficult for us to escape the negative conditions of the last three churches. These churches represent the Protestant denominations, the Brethren assemblies, and us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN SARDIS,<br />
THE CHURCH IN PHILADELPHIA,<br />
AND THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</h2>
<p>The prominent characteristic of the church in Sardis is that it has a name that it is living but is dead and that none of its works are completed before God (3:1-2). The church in Sardis is dead, and her works before God are not completed. It has a good beginning but no completion. This is the condition of the Protestant churches after the Reformation brought in by Martin Luther. Their beginning seemed to be living, but they were about to die. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;Establish the things which remain, which were about to die.&rdquo; In this short epistle to Sardis the Lord used the words <em>dead</em> and <em>die</em> to indicate that the actual situation of the Protestant churches is one of death.</p>
<p>The church in Philadelphia continues the revival of the Protestant churches and progresses to reach a peak. The characteristic of the church in Philadelphia is that it has a little power and has kept the Lord&rsquo;s word and has not denied His name (v. 8). In other words, the church in Philadelphia highly regards the Lord&rsquo;s word. The Lord knows that none of us have the power to keep His word; nevertheless, He commended Philadelphia for keeping His word and not denying His name, saying, &ldquo;You have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name.&rdquo; According to church history there has never been a church like the Brethren of the nineteenth century with regard to their seriousness, pursuit, and openness toward the Lord&rsquo;s Word. The Brethren opened and interpreted the Bible. Martin Luther released the Bible that the Catholic Church had sealed. However, even though people had the Bible in their hands, they did not understand what they read. Many Bible expositors were raised up among the Brethren to interpret the Bible so that it could be understood. The messages and light they released poured forth like a torrent. In the early days we read their books and received much help from them. However, after a period of time they degraded and became the church in Laodicea.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the church in Laodicea is that it is neither cold nor hot (v. 15). Whereas Sardis is half dead and half living, Laodicea is neither cold nor hot, but the Lord desires that she be zealous (v. 19). The Lord desires us to be like boiling water and burning fire. The Lord&rsquo;s word is very meaningful; on one hand, He wants us to be boiling, and on the other hand, He wants us to be burning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION AMONG US</h2>
<p>In our present condition we are either Sardis, Philadelphia, or Laodicea. We cannot be the Catholic Church. For a period of time our condition may be that of Philadelphia, but after a short period, we can unconsciously fall into the condition of Sardis or become Laodicea. The condition of Sardis is that she is dead. The fact that she has a name that she is living proves that she has activity and work, but there is no momentum of life in her activity. During the past sixty years the condition in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has matched the peak condition of Philadelphia as well as the condition of Sardis and Laodicea. We have experienced and expressed all three conditions. At times we are Philadelphia, which is living and keeps the Lord&rsquo;s word. At other times we are half dead and half living. And at still other times we are neither cold nor hot. This is visible in how the brothers and sisters regularly attend the meetings even though they are lukewarm.</p>
<p>In 1949 the Lord sent me to Taiwan, and I began the work on August 1. At that time we built a small meeting hall in Taipei that could seat four to five hundred people. I lived in Taipei for many years and held conferences and trainings there; hence, I have a deep relationship with the church in Taipei. We are not in the situation of the first group of churches in Revelation 2 and 3. We cannot be in the church in Ephesus, which is the church at the close of the initial stage, nor in the church in Smyrna, which is the church under persecution, nor in the church in Pergamos, which is the church married to the world, nor in the church in Thyatira, which is the church in apostasy, the Roman Catholic Church. Rather, our condition seems to change from that of one church to another in the second group of churches; our condition is either that of Sardis or Philadelphia or Laodicea. Almost all the brothers and sisters have experienced being half dead and half living, being burning and keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word with a little power, and being lukewarm.</p>
<p>Are we Philadelphia, Sardis, or Laodicea? The characteristic of Sardis is being dead, the characteristic of Laodicea is being lukewarm, and the characteristic of Philadelphia is being living and vital, by keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word with a little power. Are we like this? The brothers and sisters may not have the same feeling concerning our situation, just as everyone has a different reaction to the same weather, with some feeling cold and others feeling hot. Nevertheless, we must ask ourselves, &ldquo;Am I living? Do I speak in the meetings?&rdquo; There are two kinds of people who do not speak: those who are dead and those who are dumb. Do we speak in the big meetings or in the small group meetings? Do we speak as soon as we enter the meeting? Because a living person cannot remain silent, it is difficult for him not to speak in different situations.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the church in Philadelphia is that she keeps the Lord&rsquo;s word to the utmost. Fifty years ago I met such a brother in Shanghai. He was a British sailor. He spoke the Lord&rsquo;s word whenever he opened his mouth; he spoke the Lord&rsquo;s word continuously. It was admirable. He was obviously a brother in the church in Philadelphia, because he knew and kept the Lord&rsquo;s word. The characteristic of Sardis is death, and the characteristic of Laodicea is lukewarmness. A local church may be in the condition of Philadelphia this year, in the condition of Sardis the next year, and in the condition of Laodicea the following year. When a church declines, there is no speaking, and then there is no activity, no work.</p>
<p>A living person must speak and work. Sardis is characterized by death. This means that she neither speaks nor acts. There appears to be no vitality in her speaking and no momentum in her actions. Hence, she has a name that she is living, and yet she is dead. When the sisters are strong and living in prayer, they have the condition of Philadelphia. When the brothers meet the Lord in the morning and touch the throne of grace, they are in the condition of Philadelphia. In the afternoon, however, they may be provoked by their wives and become deflated. Thus, they are Philadelphia in the morning and Sardis in the afternoon. Our condition is not constant. This also applies to the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REASON FOR BECOMING<br />
THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</h2>
<p>The church can be degraded and become Laodicea because the believers may not have much fellowship with the Lord, even though they love Him. They have received grace from the Lord, and they do not want to be defiled by sin or to love the world, but they are not inwardly burning or near to the Lord. For example, even though we read the Bible in the morning, we may not have intimate fellowship with the Lord. If we do not have intimate fellowship with the Lord, it does not make a difference whether we read the Bible. Hence, our condition is dry, and we are about to die. When we come to the meeting, we are not living, and we do not open our mouth. Many brothers and sisters have been in the church for a long time and have become old. They feel that everything is about the same. When a person becomes old, he is lukewarm.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVIVALS OF THE PROTESTANT CHURCH<br />
BEING TEMPORARY</h2>
<p>Due to its condition of death and dryness, Protestantism has always needed revivals. But the effect of the revivals is always temporary. The greatest revival was the Welsh revival in Wales, Great Britain. However, in less than thirty years their condition declined. It now seems as if the gospel was never preached there; some people in Wales do not believe in or even know the name of the Lord Jesus. Hence, revivals are unreliable. When the effects of a revival weaken, there is the need for another revival. When the effect of a second revival weakens, there is the need for yet another one. Protestantism relies on revivals.</p>
<p>A new believer is inwardly burning and wants to testify for the Lord. However, after two or three weeks he may calm down. We can say that he has calmed down, but actually he has become dead. Later when he attends the Sunday service, he acknowledges his inability to understand the Bible or to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Hence, he cannot speak or do anything; he must allow the pastor to speak. Because the pastor has obtained a Ph.D. in theology, he is knowledgeable and eloquent and can give speeches. It seems reasonable for the pastor to speak in the meeting. Therefore, the pastor gives a sermon every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, and the believers simply attend the Sunday service. They do not know that every believer has the Lord&rsquo;s life and the Holy Spirit. We should let this life grow within us and let the Holy Spirit lead us to speak.</p>
<p>If a child is unable to call for his mother by the age of five, she will surely begin to worry. There are many in Christianity who cannot speak after they have been saved for five years and some cannot speak even after thirty years. There are such ones among us. They say, &ldquo;It is not my business to speak in the meetings; it is the responsibility of Brother So-and-so and the elders. I come only to listen.&rdquo; This is to kill, to annul, and to not inspire the function of speaking. A mother always tries to inspire her children to speak. In Protestantism, however, the way and habit are to suppress the believers and to not inspire them. This has also been true among us. The less a person speaks, the less he will know how to speak; eventually, he will give up speaking and only come for a Sunday service. It seems as if the majority of Christians are accustomed to bringing only their ears to the chapels or the meeting halls and not their mouths.</p>
<p>Some people say that in the scientific era of the twentieth century everything is focused on professionalism and that different kinds of work should be done by professionals. Many think that only those who have studied theology should give sermons, rather than &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; people. They say, &ldquo;We do business, we teach at schools, or we are lawyers. We already spend five or six days at our work. We are happy to simply go to a chapel on the Lord&rsquo;s Day to offer monetary gifts and listen to the pastor&rsquo;s sermon. Why should we speak?&rdquo; This word seems logical, but it is unscriptural.</p>
<p>The Bible says that as believers we need to speak whenever we come to the meetings (1 Cor. 14:26, 31). Some people use all kinds of reasons to attack us, saying, &ldquo;Do not go to them; they will not give you any rest. They shout in their meetings and force people to speak. Go to a place that is quiet and calm. Go to a place where the pastor speaks well and you do not need to worry about anything.&rdquo; Protestantism seemingly works for the Lord, but actually it &ldquo;kills&rdquo; people. Even though they preach the gospel and people are truly brought to salvation, new believers are led to simply listen to sermons on Sunday. After two or three years these believers do not know how to speak for the Lord. The more they listen to sermons, the more they dare not speak and the more they think that they should not speak. This is to bring people into error.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals that a proper Christian should love the Lord, take Him as the center, and give Him the preeminence, the first place. Such a person should have a proper condition in his daily life. His schedule should have a proper time to rise and to go to bed. He should do everything in a regulated way. We must be such people, living a normal life; everything we do should be through prayer and consideration, whether it is going to bed, rising in the morning, eating our meals, or taking care of our business. If, according to our situation, it is right for us to rise at 6:30 in the morning, we should practice this daily. The first thing we should do after waking up is to draw near to the Lord. Before getting out of bed, we should call on the Lord without disturbing others. Following this, we should read a short portion of the Lord&rsquo;s Word. We should read at least two verses from the Bible, pray-reading the verses, reading by praying. Then while we are preparing for the day, we should muse over these verses. This is the proper condition of those who love the Lord as normal Christians.</p>
<p>We should not conduct ourselves according to our mood. We should not do something when we are happy but not do it when we are unhappy. Strictly speaking, a Christian should not have an unhappy moment. This is the reason that the Bible tells us to rejoice in the Lord always (1 Thes. 5:16; Phil. 3:1; 4:4). To rejoice is to be happy. A Christian should not be unhappy. Ephesians 4:26 says, &ldquo;Do not let the sun go down on your indignation.&rdquo; In other words, our anger should not last longer than twenty-four hours. The sun goes down once every twenty-four hours. Hence, our anger should vanish when the sun sets; otherwise, it is a sin. This is a command of the Lord. Christians should always rejoice and always give thanks to the Lord. If we begin our day in this way, we will live Christ throughout the whole day, and we will be filled with thanksgiving to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN OUR LIVING<br />
AND TAKING THE GOSPEL AS OUR MAIN OCCUPATION</h2>
<p>If a person lives Christ in his dealings with others and at home, work, and school, he will definitely preach the gospel. If he does not preach the gospel, he will feel empty within. We should preach the gospel not only when we knock on doors at an appointed time; we should preach the gospel everywhere. We should begin with areas that are close to us and then continue with areas that are farther away. This principle was set by the Lord Jesus. He said, &ldquo;You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). We should preach to our relatives, then to our friends and colleagues. If we are in the condition of Philadelphia, we will preach the gospel from morning until evening. This does not mean that we will drop our occupations and serve full time. Every Christian with a normal living should have a proper job where he works faithfully and competently. However, he should not sell himself as a slave to his occupation for the sake of a promotion or an increase in salary. Revelation 18:13 says that the souls of men are sold as cargo in Babylon the Great. This refers to men who sell themselves for employment. There is no need for us to sell ourselves for employment. We can have a job and preach the gospel at the same time. Apparently, our job is our main occupation; however, before the Lord our main occupation is to preach the gospel. Our job is a secondary occupation that enables us to cover our living expenses; our main occupation is to live for the Lord. Thus, our employment is actually our secondary occupation.</p>
<p>Apparently the main occupation of the young people is to study. However, because of their love for the Lord and His word, preaching the gospel becomes their main occupation, and their studies are secondary. Our primary occupation should be the preaching of the gospel. Every brother and sister in Philadelphia should preach the gospel and take the gospel as their primary occupation; their profession should be their secondary occupation. Even becoming the director of a manufacturing factory is but a secondary occupation. Our primary occupation is to earnestly preach the gospel to all our fellow employees and then to their families. We may feel that it is difficult and embarrassing to knock on doors, but if all the brothers and sisters preached the gospel in their daily living, there would be no need to knock on doors. If we would speak to our families, colleagues, and employees, they in turn would speak to the people around them.</p>
<p>It is normal for a teacher to preach the gospel to his students, to his colleagues and other staff members, and to their families. Even a junior employee can preach the gospel. Fifty years ago in Tsinan, Shantung Province, there was an important official who had studied in the United States. A believer, who considered gospel preaching to be his main occupation, worked as a janitor in the same department as this official. Every day after cleaning, the believer placed a gospel tract on the official&rsquo;s desk. When the official saw the gospel tract, he would angrily throw it away. Even though the brother would see the discarded gospel tract when he emptied the trash, he was not discouraged. Instead, he would place another gospel tract on the official&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>The brother, who worked as a janitor, not only placed gospel tracts on the official&rsquo;s desk; he also prayed desperately for the official. One day the official decided to visit the brother at home in order to know the reason he was receiving the gospel tracts. The brother and his wife were both saved and loved the Lord; hence, there was a pleasant situation in their family. The official and his wife admired what they saw and believed in the Lord. After believing in the Lord, preaching the gospel also became the primary occupation of the official. If all the brothers and sisters in Taipei were like this, we would not need to go door-knocking. A normal Christian works during the day and goes to meetings in the evening. He meets with his family at home, visits new believers in their homes, and meets together with several homes in a larger meeting.</p>
<p>A Christian should be living and active every day. When he rises in the morning, he should call on the Lord, read the Bible, and fellowship with the Lord. When he goes to work, he should preach the gospel. Throughout the day he should call on the Lord, sing, give thanks, praise, and pray. When he goes home in the evening, he should have a good meeting with his family. Meeting is our relaxation, our entertainment. In the meetings we sing, pray, read, and speak. As a result, everyone understands the truth, knows the Bible, and is able to speak for the Lord. Everyone speaks because there are no pastors or preachers. This kind of meeting inspires people to speak and function, and all kinds of gifts are manifested in the church life. Others should not be prevented from speaking if they have the gift of teaching. Although not all are teachers, all can speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>Regardless of what our condition is, we must see the picture in the Bible and be normal Christians. We should not rely on the messages given by gifted brothers on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Every day we must all study the truth systematically. The error of the Protestant denominations is that they only have a few famous speakers who give messages. A student who always listens to famous lecturers but never does any homework will not learn much. This has been our mistake. First Corinthians 14:26 says that when the church comes together, &ldquo;each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation.&rdquo; The Bible does not indicate that in a regular gathering of the church only one person should speak while others listen. Rather, all the saints should open their mouths and manifest their function.</p>
<p>In order to manifest our function, we need to call on the name of the Lord, pray-read His word, and fellowship with Him once we wake up in the morning. We need to know that our jobs are secondary occupations. Preaching the gospel is our primary occupation. In the evening we should attend home meetings or small group meetings, and we should all speak for the Lord. We should not have only one person speaking in our meetings; we all should speak. The more we exercise to speak, the more we will be able to speak. This should be our living.</p>
<p>I was saved and began to love the Lord before I was twenty years old. From that time I have pursued the Lord and diligently read the Bible and spiritual publications. When the pastor in the denomination where I was saw that I was pursuing the Lord, he invited me to speak in the big auditorium of the chapel. Because I was nervous after receiving this invitation, I began to practice speaking. I went to the seashore and spoke loudly to the ocean. A new believer who practices speaking after his salvation will not be afraid to speak even to a large number of people. If all the brothers and sisters practice this, we will surely be the church in Philadelphia, not Sardis or Laodicea.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 4:10; 5:10; 2 Pet. 1:2; 3:18; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</h1>
<p>We should all speak whenever we come together. We should not speak idle words, human words, or negative words. Instead, we should speak words of God, that is, words of Spirit, light, life, grace, blessing, and wisdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NORMAL, PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>Concerning the home meetings, we have considered a life of pursuing the truth and the importance of being filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word in our living. When we rise early in the morning, we should first contact the Lord and fellowship with Him. We should then enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s Word in order to be filled with His speaking during the day. This will enable us to preach the gospel at work and to live a meeting life in the evening. We will be able to speak the Lord&rsquo;s words to one another in the meetings, and the words we speak will be words of truth.</p>
<p>May we all be led into a proper, normal Christian life. The most important thing in such a living is to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; the moment we wake up in the morning. As soon as we get out of bed, we should fellowship with the Lord. We can enjoy two verses from the Word, and we can read while praying and pray while reading. All day long we should be soaked in the Lord&rsquo;s word; then spontaneously we will live Christ.</p>
<p>We all have a heart and a burden to preach the gospel. We should not preach the gospel in an ostentatious way but in a spontaneous way. In other words, preaching the gospel is our living and our occupation. If someone asked me what my occupation is, I would say that I am a gospel preacher. I hope that all the brothers and sisters can also say that they are gospel preachers. Preaching the gospel is our main occupation. The jobs that we do to meet the necessities of our living are side jobs; they are secondary. The most important goal in our Christian life is to preach the Lord Jesus and bring people into the Lord so that they can follow Him. This will bring in the kingdom of the Lord.</p>
<p>After fellowshipping with the Lord in the morning, we should stay saturated with the Lord&rsquo;s word, live Christ, and preach the gospel during the day. In the evening we should not merely &ldquo;attend a meeting&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;go and meet&rdquo; in order to offer our portion. Through preaching the gospel, our relatives, classmates, and colleagues may be brought to salvation. If we feel to visit someone in the evening, we should go. We may miss a meeting, but we will be meeting with someone. At another time we may feel burdened to meet with our family at home. Whether we go out or stay home, we should come together to enjoy the Lord.</p>
<p>The words <em>attend a meeting</em> imply that we do not need to do anything but simply sit, listen, and look around. But the words <em>go and meet</em> mean that we are active participants, not spectators. If we are going to play basketball, we do not &ldquo;attend&rdquo; basketball; we play basketball. The difference is crucial. We should not attend a meeting; we should go to meet. We should not attend a prayer meeting; rather, we should go to a prayer meeting. To go to a prayer meeting means that we go to pray. There is a great difference in these two expressions.</p>
<p>We should all study the Word every day. We should also pray, sing, and speak the truth to others. We should not speak idle words; we should speak the Lord Jesus and the gospel. In addition to this, we should have an occupation as a side job to cover the needs of our living. If we are able to cover our livelihood by working eight hours a day, we should not work more hours even if we are offered a higher salary. We are not slaves to this world, and the world is not worthy of us (Heb. 11:38). Every evening we can visit our relatives or friends. If we do this for several hours in the evening, we may save two people or edify four. This is much better than working overtime and having an increase in salary.</p>
<p>This is the normal living of a Christian; this is the genuine, proper Christian life. We are not here for our education, our career, or for money. We are those who spend our energy on the Lord Jesus. This means that we labor on the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WORD AS GRACE<br />
NEEDING TO PROSPER, GROW, AND MULTIPLY</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:10; 5:10; 2 Peter 1:2; and 3:18 can be grouped together into one category because they all speak of grace. First Peter 4:10 says, &ldquo;Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.&rdquo; We are stewards ministering grace. It is a pity that the Chinese Union Version translates the word <em>grace</em> as &ldquo;gift.&rdquo; It says that we are &ldquo;good stewards of the varied gifts of God.&rdquo; In the original Greek, the meaning of the word <em>varied</em> implies more than a large amount; it also implies a large variety. Therefore, <em>varied</em> implies a large variety as well as a large quantity. For example, one hundred small cakes may be a large quantity, but there may not be a large variety of cakes. But if the one hundred cakes consist of British biscuits, Danish pastries, and German bread, then there are many varieties. For this reason, the Recovery Version of the Bible translates the phrase as <em>varied grace,</em> implying that there is largeness both in number and in variety.</p>
<p>First Peter 5:10 says, &ldquo;The God of all grace.&rdquo; Our God is a God of all grace, and this grace multiplies. For this reason, 2 Peter 1:2 says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace be multiplied.&rdquo; The Chinese Union Version translates <em>be multiplied</em> as &ldquo;be added bountifully.&rdquo; The word <em>bountifully</em> is an adverb or an auxiliary in the Chinese, but in Greek this word is a verb meaning to multiply and to increase. It refers to the grace that is multiplying in us. This means that grace will multiply and increase in us. Eventually, the apostle Peter admonishes us to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (3:18). Grace is varied, all-inclusive, and multiplying; it is inexhaustible. Therefore, we should grow in this grace.</p>
<p>Acts 6:7; 12:24; and 19:20 belong to another group which says that the Lord&rsquo;s word grows and multiplies. Acts 6:7 says, &ldquo;The word of God grew.&rdquo; Anything that grows must have life; hence, the Lord&rsquo;s word has life since it can grow. A rock that is planted will never grow. However, any kind of seed will grow if it is planted. Just like a planted seed, the Lord&rsquo;s word grows in us. Acts 12:24 says, &ldquo;The word of God grew and multiplied.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s word not only grows but also multiplies. Acts 19:20 says, &ldquo;Thus, the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we put these two groups of verses together, we can see the relationship between grace and the Word. In the Bible the Word is God, the Lord Himself. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). The Bible also shows that grace is God Himself. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; In this verse the Word and grace are connected. This verse also shows that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. The Word came to dwell in us as grace. This grace is the embodiment of the Word; hence, the Word is also called the word of His grace (Acts 14:3; 20:32). The genuine, proper Christian life is a life that spends time in the Word and enjoys the word of His grace. The Word is God, and grace is also God. Hence, we should enjoy God and grace every day.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TRAINING TO SPEAK<br />
WHEN DOOR-KNOCKING AND VISITING PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Some say that we cannot gain people, because we do not know how to speak when we go door-knocking. It is indeed impossible to gain people if we do not know how to speak when we knock on doors. The secret to gaining people is speaking. There is a saying in Chinese that a statement can cause a nation to rise or fall. Likewise, a sentence can cause a person to be saved or to perish. Whether a person is saved or perishes depends on our speaking. If we speak appropriately, people will be saved; if we speak inappropriately, people will perish. Hence, we need to be trained.</p>
<p>The co-workers in America wrote me to say that saints in a mountain area came together during one weekend. There were several small churches in that area that are far apart from each other. These saints gathered together to keep a feast by knocking on doors to bring people to salvation. The saints in America call this a &ldquo;festival.&rdquo; This was more than one locality that went door-knocking. It was several neighboring churches coming together to hold a feast. This can be compared to the children of Israel who came together in Jerusalem whenever there was a feast. It was only recently that we heard of the saints in America practicing in this way. This also requires training.</p>
<p>We have been conducting semi-annual trainings related to the life-study of the Bible for over ten years in Anaheim. This past summer training was a training for the new way as well as a training for the life-study of the Bible. Fifteen hundred saints were in the training. The training was not conducted as in the past. We did not have two messages in the morning and one message in the evening, and there was no testing. This training was not only for the life-study of the Bible but also for the new way; everyone had to go out to knock on doors in the evenings. Some of the saints had been trained for one or two terms and could be considered to be experienced. Others, however, had never been trained and did not know what to do or say. Three sessions in the training were used to train the saints. Then we fasted, prayed, and went out in three hundred assigned teams.</p>
<p>The leading ones were concerned about whether fifteen hundred saints would be able to gain people by knocking on doors. However, we conducted the training with confidence because of our past experience with door-knocking. On the first night the three hundred teams baptized one hundred fifty-one people. When the saints returned, they were beside themselves, because this was unprecedented. In the afternoon of the second day, the saints gathered and considered how to improve. Then they went out again. Originally, we estimated that two hundred people could be baptized in ten days, but three thousand seven hundred people were baptized. All of Orange County was shaken.</p>
<p>When we go to knock on doors, we need to have words, and then we need to have grace. When we knock on doors, we should not speak common words. We should speak proper and essential words that can touch people&rsquo;s hearts. We should speak what we have been taught. If we speak only crucial words, we can touch people&rsquo;s hearts after just two or three words and lead them to pray and be baptized. When we knock on doors, we also need grace. We must be filled with the Holy Spirit and have the Lord&rsquo;s grace. Therefore, we must contact the Lord to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to have grace. The Word is for our speaking, and the Spirit is for our moving. The Word and the Spirit are one. If we speak the right words and enjoy the Spirit, we will definitely succeed when we go out to knock on doors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE SPEAKING<br />
TO LEAD PEOPLE TO SALVATION<br />
AND TO CARE FOR PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Everything we do depends on a method. Even after finding the method, however, we still need the motivating power. For this reason a genuine Christian should be one who labors on the Word and enjoys grace. Then he will be full of motivating power and able to speak in the meetings. Even though we may have listened to messages for more than thirty years, we do not have much to say, and we cannot speak the truth. When people come to fellowship with us concerning their problems, the most we can say is, &ldquo;The Lord is faithful.&rdquo; We do not even know where to find this verse in the Bible. Sometimes the brothers have encouraged us to speak in the meetings, but we could not say anything even though we desired to speak. We had nothing to say. Eventually, all we could do was attend the meeting. This was truly the situation among us.</p>
<p>There was a time in China when it was possible for a person to become a &ldquo;scholar&rdquo; but still be unable to write a letter to his family. This was the product of an old style of education. One of my granddaughters is almost nine years old, and she writes very good letters in English to my wife and me. This is the result of a new way of education. When we read two verses in the morning, we should not read them without knowing how to apply them. If we read the Bible in that way, we will receive little benefit. We must learn to apply what we read. The American education is like this. As soon as students learn something, they must immediately apply it. This is the reason that my granddaughter&rsquo;s English is much better and more advanced than mine, even though she may not necessarily know as much as I do. The environment has trained her to speak and write. Whenever she learns a new word, she is able to use it appropriately and precisely. Her writing is also fluent and vivid. This is the kind of education we desire.</p>
<p>Some may say that as long as we love the Lord and love and pray for the church, the Lord will be pleased with us. They may say that since they do not have the gift of preaching, those who have the gift should go and preach, and they will pray for them and offer money. There are many brothers and sisters who think this way. They are faithful and love the Lord, but they do not understand that the Lord desires us to be His mouthpieces, speaking for Him and speaking Him into others. The Lord does not want only a hundred people to speak for Him. He desires that every believer who has received His grace would speak for Him.</p>
<p>If we fellowship with the Lord every day, labor on His Word and are saturated with the Lord&rsquo;s word, live before Him and genuinely live Christ, and take the gospel as our primary occupation, speaking the Lord Jesus to every person we meet, we should each be able to save one person every day. Some may consider that this is not possible. Some saints have not led a single person to salvation in twenty years, because they have not had a normal Christian life. If we love the Lord, fellowship with Him, live in His word, and take the gospel as our main occupation, we should be able to lead at least one person to salvation every week. In today&rsquo;s society, particularly in Taiwan, there are people everywhere. There is no need for us to cast a net; the &ldquo;fish&rdquo; will jump in to us, even into our homes. Every day there are many people around us at our schools, at our work, and where we live. These places are our fishing ponds.</p>
<p>If we made a list of our relatives, friends, classmates, and colleagues, there would probably be at least fifty names, and if the gospel was our primary occupation, we could save forty-eight people in a year. This means that in a year of fifty-two weeks minus four weeks for holidays, one person could be saved during each of the remaining forty-eight weeks. Even if we lowered the standard and saved one person per month, we could still save twelve people a year. If there are two thousand five hundred people in our meetings and each person leads twelve people to salvation in a year, thirty thousand people would be saved in a year. This would be glorious.</p>
<p>I hope that all the brothers and sisters, especially the older saints, would consider this as a business deal. It is worthwhile for us to devote our whole being to this matter. We know that it is not easy to change the system, because for over thirty years we have unconsciously established an unshakable habit among us. We have even conducted ourselves according to this habit. For example, since I grew up in Shantung Province, I spoke Mandarin with a Shantung accent. My desire to change my accent was to no avail. Similarly, for thirty years we have been in an old way of meeting in which we never had to speak much. Now we are suddenly being asked to speak in every meeting. Even though this is difficult, we must change. If we do not change, we will not go forward.</p>
<p>When I was young, I studied in an American school. The school was run by Americans, and almost all the teachers were Americans. Most of the subjects, whether geography or mathematics, were taught by Americans. The students were Chinese and Korean. All the teachers wore Western suits, but the students dared not wear suits or speak English, even though we were taught English. When I went to Taiwan, I was still wearing my long Chinese gown. It was only when I was preparing to go abroad to the Philippines that I changed my attire. We hold on to our old ways to our loss. We should be willing to change our ways.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord, we should gain people for the Lord, eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word every day, and speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to our family members, neighbors, and friends. If we would speak every day, the Lord would be happy. We should not consider that since we are sitting in God&rsquo;s presence and listening to His servant, it is sufficient to sit in a big meeting in which one brother gives a message. We may even think that this is better than going to the movie theater or watching television at home, but if we conduct ourselves in this way year after year, the church will not increase or multiply. If we fellowship with the Lord every day, are saturated with His word, preach the gospel to lead people to salvation, establish home meetings and small group meetings, and gather together with others to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word, then spontaneously people will be supplied and edified. Those who are supplied and edified will become remaining fruit. As a result, the church will grow and multiply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SETTING ASIDE THE TIME<br />
TO ENJOY THE LORD AND VISIT PEOPLE</h2>
<p>As long as we are saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must take this way. Whether we have been saved for many years or are new believers, whether we are young or old, we must fellowship with the Lord daily, be soaked in His Word, pray, live Christ, and preach the gospel. In this way we will not be idle, and we will bear fruit. In John 15:1-2 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.&rdquo; The branches that do not bear fruit will be taken away and will lose the enjoyment of the sap of the vine tree.</p>
<p>The church is taking the new way, but this does not mean that it neglects the spiritual care of the brothers and sisters. We must rise up in the morning to contact the Lord through His Word. Our Bible is an opened Bible. If we pray-read it and study it diligently, we will be edified in life. May we all receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace to practice this. In addition, whether we are young or old, we must make a schedule that is according to our environment, family, job, and other factors in our lives. The schedule should include when to go to bed and when to wake up. This will give us a regulated living. If a lover of the Lord is not regulated in his daily living, he will surely fail. We should exercise self-control and be restricted in all things. It is not appropriate to conduct ourselves according to impulse. We must rise up in the morning at a regular time to enjoy the Lord and go to bed at a regular time. Then we can rise up early the next day.</p>
<p>If we do not work on a night shift or hold an evening job, we should go to bed early and rise up early. We should be regulated in this way and do everything with a plan and a budget. This will enable us to utilize our time appropriately. Even though we need to preach the gospel every day, taking the gospel as our main occupation, our gospel preaching should still be according to a schedule. We should go out to knock on doors at least once a week for two hours or longer. We must set aside a certain time to go out once every week.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should be willing to learn. We need to learn how to feed others with the Bible and how to use the truth to help others so that they may enjoy God&rsquo;s grace. We should speak the Lord&rsquo;s word and also be those who have a motivating power. We should not only receive the arrangement of the church through our enjoyment of grace; we must be those who have a vision. We should not do anything rashly or casually. We should exercise our spirit to preach the gospel and have weekly home meetings according to the help of the brothers and under their leading and teaching. In this way our church will be the church in Philadelphia, and the numbers in the church will increase. Grace is universal. There is rain and there is grace everywhere.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GOAL OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY&mdash;<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:8-16</h1>
<p>In this chapter and the next, our burden is to give a clear and concise presentation of the goal of the God-ordained way and the necessary steps for its practice. For this reason we must speak for the Lord according to the high standard of the Bible. We need to use our spirit and our sober mind to understand and receive these words. We look to the Lord for His grace that we would be able to present the new way clearly and completely.</p>
<p>We have been speaking concerning the God-ordained way for more than three years. This way is the ancient way in the Bible. It was practiced by the apostles two thousand years ago in the early church. However, when the church became degraded, the church gradually fell into the world, left the scriptural revelation, and practiced what we call the old way. After we saw the light in the Bible, we were willing to receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace to recover the way that was lost. Hence, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, this is what we call the new way. The new way that we are recovering is actually the church&rsquo;s practice from two thousand years ago; it is the way ordained by God according to His eternal economy.</p>
<p>The new way is clearly revealed in the New Testament in a gradual way. Our natural concepts, however, prevent us from seeing the new way when we read the New Testament. When we read the Bible, we are usually impressed with the things we already know, and we respond to them, but we are unable to understand the things concerning God&rsquo;s heart, even after we read them numerous times. For example, there are many deep points in Ephesians 4:8-16 that we do not understand. Therefore, when we read these verses, we must look to the Lord to give us revelation and light so that we can see the deep things of God in this portion of the Word.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:8-16 speaks mainly of the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the goal of the God-ordained way. It seems as though our initial speaking about the new way gave the saints the impression that the goal of the new way is to knock on doors. However, preaching the gospel through door-knocking is not the goal of the new way. The home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings are also not the goal of the new way. The goal of the new way is the building up of the Body of Christ. We preach the gospel by knocking on doors because we want to obtain the materials necessary for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We preach the gospel for people to be regenerated and become materials for the building up of the Body of Christ. The home meetings are for the perfecting of the new believers so that they can function in the meetings. The further step of group meetings provides the saints with mutual fellowship, mutual care, and mutual edification. The district meetings help the saints enter into the church life and function organically by supplying and building up one another through their speaking. These four steps are for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE BODY BEING DIFFERENT<br />
FROM BUILDING UP A SOCIETY</h2>
<p>Every person has a physical body; Christ also has a Body. The Body of Christ is the church (1:22-23). On the surface, our body seems to be made up of different members and parts that are joined together in an organized way. However, when we make a chair by joining different pieces of wood together in an organized way, we get something very different from a body. A chair is a lifeless composition, but a body is an organism, a living composition. Any part of a body, regardless of how big or small it may be, has the sense and function of life. Similarly, the Body of Christ, the church, is not an organization but an organism. Hence, when we build up the Body of Christ, we are not building up a society, an organization, or a group.</p>
<p>The traditional way of Christianity does not emphasize the Body of Christ; it emphasizes only outward organization. In Christianity a person is encouraged to believe and then become a member of a group. Then elections are held, a board of directors is chosen, and people are selected for different kinds of services. This is not the Body of Christ; it is an assembly. The Body of Christ is composed of a group of people who have repented and have received Christ as their life and their Savior; these people are regenerated in their spirit, and the Holy Spirit operates within them and fills their being for their transformation and growth in the divine life.</p>
<p>If I do not have an organic body to cooperate with the life of my person, I cannot express myself when I speak. The Lord Jesus is the One who fills all in all; therefore, He needs an organism, His Body, for His expression. However, He does not yet have His Body, the proper church on the earth today. Even though we have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for many years, and there are now more than one thousand one hundred local churches on the six continents, we lack the element of the organism of Christ. We are short of the organic expression of life; hence, our situation is mainly one of organization. This is the result of the old way. Therefore, we need to turn to the new way in order to develop the organic function of all the members so that the Lord can obtain an organic Body.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Needing Christ as the Head</h2>
<p>To build up the Body of Christ, we need Christ as the Head. A body must have a head, and Christ is the Head of the Body of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s being the Head is an indication of His victory and of His passing through death and resurrection. On the cross the Lord destroyed &ldquo;him who has the might of death, that is, the devil&rdquo; (Heb. 2:14). The Lord then entered into Hades and overcame death by coming out of Hades. Then He ascended into the heavens. Through the victory of His death and resurrection and through the exaltation in His ascension, Christ led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men (Eph. 4:8).</p>
<p>Even though we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world (1:4), when man fell, he became a captive of Satan through sin and death (2:1). However, God did not abandon us. He was incarnated, and He passed through death, resurrection, and ascension to solve the problem of sin, to destroy Satan and death, and to deliver us from the authority of Satan so that we could sit with Him in the heavenlies. We were redeemed and regenerated, and we obtained the life of God and the Holy Spirit. Now we are being transformed and are growing in life to be gifts to the Body. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are examples of gifted members (4:8-11). The Lord gave these gifted members to His Body. He did this in the age of the apostles, and He continues to give gifted ones to His Body. The Lord made every believer a gift to His Body, and He made some believers apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers so that they can be given to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing the Gifts</h2>
<p>The gifts&mdash;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers&mdash;are produced by the Head for the Body. The work of the gifts is not to build up the Body of Christ directly; rather, their work is to perfect the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ (v. 12). Even though these four groups of people work in different ways, they all have one goal&mdash;the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The gifts do not build up the Body of Christ directly; instead, they perfect the saints to build up the Body of Christ. In the old and traditional way of Christianity the pastors, the clergy, give sermons and do the work of God. Only the clergy build up the church; the congregation does not build up the church. The God-ordained way is different. In the God-ordained way the church is not built up directly by a small group of gifted believers; instead, the gifts perfect the saints so that everyone can do what the gifts do. Everyone can do the work of the ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The main thing accomplished in the new way is the perfecting of all the saints. In the old way the saints were only required to listen to messages in the meetings. We practiced this for decades, but we did not perfect many saints. It is as if we conducted classes to spiritually educate the saints for decades, but no one graduated, and we did not produce many teachers. It was, therefore, difficult for the church to increase and spread. This situation proves that there is a problem with our practice. We must change and take the new way in order to perfect the saints.</p>
<p>Although the gifts work in different ways, the goal of their work is the perfecting of the saints. The apostles do three things: they preach the gospel in new areas to lead people to salvation, they establish churches, and they define and expound the truth. The apostles, however, also need to perfect other believers to do these things. This also applies to the prophets. They should not merely speak for God and speak forth God; they should also perfect others to be prophets. We also need the evangelists to perfect the saints. The evangelists need to know how to lead the saints, who are learning to preach the gospel by knocking on doors, to go into the midst of wolves and find the sons of peace (cf. Luke 10:3, 6). The brothers and sisters need to be perfected in all these areas. In addition, we need the shepherds and teachers to care for people by shepherding and teaching the saints. They also need to perfect the saints to be able to shepherd and teach others.</p>
<p>Hence, the new way allows the gifts in the church to perfect the saints. They perfect the saints to preach the gospel and lead people to believe in the Lord. They also perfect the saints to establish meetings in the homes of the new ones and to lead the new ones to testify for the Lord, to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, and to speak for the Lord. The saints also learn to care for one another, to nourish one another, and to function organically. If we are willing to humbly learn and faithfully exercise to do these things according to the way revealed in the Bible, we will be able to build up the Body that God desires. In other words, all the gifts&mdash;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers&mdash;must lead and perfect the saints to do these four things. Then there will be apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers among the saints, and the church will receive a great blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing the Perfected Members</h2>
<p>For the building up of the Body of Christ, all the perfected members need to hold to truth in love (Eph. 4:15). In other words, we need to hold God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the truth, the things that are true. When we hold to truth in love, we will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. We will also have something that is out from the Head for the building up of His Body. Every joint will be of the rich supply, and each one part will operate according to its measure so that the entire Body is joined and knit together. This causes the Body of Christ to grow up and expand&mdash;to build up itself in love (v. 16).</p>
<p>When all the members are perfected to grow in life and to function organically, they will be joined together and built up as one Body, and the Lord will have an organic Body for His complete expression. That will be a glorious and blessed situation. May all the saints clearly see this vision and pray for this vision so that they become blessed people in the God-ordained way, people who manifest their organic function and are being built up in the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<p>When we have this desire, we will enter into many things, and we will learn to pray, to speak for the Lord, to care for other believers, and to perfect them to do what we do. In addition, some saints will learn how to preach the gospel in new places, establish churches, and rightly expound the truth. This is how the believers who take the God-ordained way will function. They will be able to speak for the Lord, to preach the gospel, and to shepherd and teach others. They will also be able to perfect others to do the same thing. The church will spread, and the Lord will obtain a built-up organic Body. May we all have a clear seeing of the goal of the new way, and may we labor with one heart to diligently learn to walk on the God-ordained way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE STEPS FOR THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-3, 5-7; 19:5, 9; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor. 14:1, 4, 26, 31</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the goal of the new way is to build up the Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ the emphasis is on organic function, not organizational work. This can be compared to our human body relying on the inward organic function of every member for its existence, not on outward organizational methods. The church as the Body of Christ is completely organic. Every believer is an organic member of this one Body and has an organic function. The God-ordained way, which God has revealed to us in the Bible, builds up the Body of Christ through the organic function of each one part.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will look at the four steps in the practice of the new way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO GAIN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The first step in the practice of the new way is to preach the gospel. When we visit people to preach the gospel, we gain people for the Lord. We want people not merely to be saved; we want them to become building material for the Body of Christ. Hence, people need to repent, be regenerated, be transformed, and grow in the divine life. Regeneration, transformation, and growth in life are organic matters for the organic building.</p>
<p>Previously, when we wanted to preach the gospel, the church set a day for a big gospel meeting, and everyone passed out tracts and put up posters. All the brothers and sisters did their best to invite their friends, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues. We spent much energy to invite people to come hear the gospel, but we did not have good results. Such a method was not wrong, and it was not entirely useless. The Bible does record an incident when people were invited to listen to the gospel (Acts 10:21-24). However, if we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that the main way to preach the gospel is to go to the sinners.</p>
<p>The Lord wants us to be fishers of men (Matt. 4:19). This means that the evangelists are fishers of men. Where can we find fishermen who, instead of going to the rivers and oceans to catch fish, send out invitations asking the fish to come to them? The Lord Himself came down from heaven to seek man. He went from village to village and even visited people in their homes. Later He sent the twelve disciples to visit people (10:5; Luke 9:1-2), and He appointed seventy others and sent them out (10:1). The Lord Jesus sent them out as lambs in the midst of wolves (v. 3). It is not easy for a lamb to visit wolves. A lamb that visits wolves will not find it enjoyable but will encounter difficulty and even be reviled.</p>
<p>Those of us who visit people to preach the gospel have experienced meeting people who really were &ldquo;wolves,&rdquo; and they gave us trouble. However, sometimes the person who opens the door is happy to welcome us, and we know that this is a son of peace. He will receive the gospel and be baptized. The saints who knock on doors to preach the gospel have many stories about how they met such sons of peace.</p>
<p>There are now more than one thousand local churches on the earth, and most of them are practicing the new way of visiting people to preach the gospel. Since the second half of 1986, more than ten thousand people have been baptized because the saints visited them to preach the gospel. Some Roman Catholic congregations have been influenced by us, and now they are visiting people to preach the gospel. In the past, even though we invited twenty to thirty guests to hear the gospel, only two or three would actually come. Now when we spend two or three hours to knock on twenty to thirty doors, we are able to lead at least one person to salvation. This is a scientific method, and it is very effective. However, it is not that easy, because it requires us to pay a price and set aside our status.</p>
<p>When we speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to others, we must believe that the Holy Spirit is with us, and we must exercise our spirit. Some of the people we meet when we knock on doors are mean when they open the door, but after we speak with them, they not only repent, pray, and believe, but they also get baptized. Within a few minutes they are transformed from being a &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; to being a &ldquo;lamb.&rdquo; During the past year and a half several hundred people spent all their time to experiment with preaching the gospel by knocking on doors. As a result we have confirmed that this is the most practical and effective way.</p>
<p>The secret to our ability to go door to door and visit people with the gospel is that we must have thick skin. No matter how insulting people are to us, we should remain composed, and even if they curse us, we should not waiver. Before we go out, we must pray, thoroughly confess our sins to the Lord, and ask Him to cleanse us with His blood so that we can be filled with the Holy Spirit. In this way the Holy Spirit will be released, and we will be bold and full of authority. We will be able to announce to the heavens and the earth that we are preaching the gospel to sinners with the Lord Jesus Christ, and we will have the authority to command people to believe and be saved. We will even be able to command the demons to leave the houses that we are visiting, because the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18-20). The Lord has given us the authority to go and disciple the nations by baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and by teaching them. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the new way is proper. In order to preach the gospel to others, we must go to them. If we do not go, who will go? Whom can God send? God will not send the angels, because in the New Testament God did not become an angel; He became a man. God became flesh to live among men. If we are not willing to move, He has no way to reach people. Hence, we must bring salvation to people in their homes, just as the Lord Jesus brought salvation to the house of Zaccheus (Luke 19:1-10).</p><h2 class="head1">PERFECTING NEW BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The second step in the practice of the new way is to perfect the new believers. The people who believe in the Lord and are baptized through our preaching the gospel are new believers. They are newborn babes, and they need much care. This is perfecting. In the past we were lacking in this matter, because most of the saints did not receive the proper leading and perfecting to know how to lead and perfect the new believers. We did not have good results even though we visited the new ones and encouraged them to attend the meetings. We were not clear that God does not want to force people to attend meetings; instead, He wants us to bring the meetings to people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<p>Just as we visit people to bring the gospel and salvation into their homes, we should take the meeting to their homes to perfect them after they are saved. We cannot expect that only two or three meetings will be sufficient to perfect them. When a new baby is born, we cannot feed him merely two or three times and then stop. In the past not many of the people remained, because we were not clear about this. Now we have learned the lesson. When we researched this point in the Bible, we realized that after a person is saved and baptized, we should immediately meet with him in his home.</p>
<p>For this reason, we should not leave immediately after we baptize a person; rather, we should spend at least half an hour to an hour with him. We should use this time to lead him to know that Jesus Christ the Savior is now the life-giving Spirit, and that when he believed, the Spirit entered into his spirit to enliven and regenerate him. We should also show him the pertinent verses in the Bible. Then we should lead him to pray and call on the Lord so that he contacts the Spirit with his spirit. After this first meeting we should visit him again after two or three days and continue visiting him every few days for a month. During this month we should use ten meetings to lead him into the basic Christian knowledge and experience. This will give him a good foundation in the divine life.</p>
<p>After the first month we can visit the new ones once a week or at least once every two weeks to have a home meeting. We should have meetings with them for a year. During this time we should tell them that we are not preachers who visit people for a living; rather, we have simply received grace from the Lord and have been moved by the Lord&rsquo;s love to lead people to be saved, to grow in life, and to be perfected. The new believers need to know that we are the same as them and that we are all brothers in the church. They also need to know that when we meet together, everyone should function. We must lead them to do what we do in the meetings so that they gradually learn to pray, sing and speak the hymns, read the Bible, and speak the Lord to others. This is for the development of their organic function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ESTABLISHING GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The third step in the practice of the God-ordained way is to establish group meetings. We should first have meetings in the homes of the new believers. After one or two months, they will be willing to meet with other Christians. At this point we can bring together three to five families of new believers who live in the same neighborhood to establish a group meeting. As the new ones get to know one another, they will encourage and build one another up. They will also be joined together in love to fellowship together and care for one another. This will give everyone a chance to manifest their organic function by speaking and testifying for the Lord.</p>
<p>Human beings are social, and they like to be with other people, not by themselves. The best people to be with are Christians, because in a Christian gathering people do not merely avoid being polluted and doing evil; they can enjoy grace and learn the truth. When a few home gatherings form a group meeting, the saints will have more of an interest to read the Bible. They will be encouraged to love the Lord and gain experiences in their love of the Lord. In this way the members of the group meetings will be able to testify, and they will be able to take a step further to speak for the Lord in the district meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FUNCTIONING IN DISTRICT MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The fourth step in the practice of the God-ordained way is to function in the district meetings. We must gradually lead the new believers from the group meetings into the district meetings and help them enter into the church life. The content of the district meetings is rich because we break bread for the remembrance of the Lord, and we study the truth. The mutual fellowship and enjoyment allows every person the opportunity to function, to speak for the Lord, and to build up others. Hence, we should lead the new ones to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord in the district meetings. Then all the saints in the meeting will function organically by speaking to supply and build up one another. In this way we will build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>I hope that this overview of the new way will help us see that the practical steps for building up the Body of Christ are altogether different from the methods practiced in organized religion. In organized religion everyone donates money, and they hire a pastor whose responsibility is to devote all his time to take care of the service to God. The believers give material offerings, but they do not participate directly in the work of building up the Body of Christ. This, however, is not our practice. As soon as we lead someone to salvation, we begin to meet in his home, and we help him to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, pray-read the Word, and fellowship with the Lord. The more he grows in life, the more he can speak forth the Lord and testify for the Lord. He does not function for money or for any personal benefit. His organic function is the issue of the divine life and the Spirit within him. The brothers and sisters who function according to the operation of the divine life within them are living and organic.</p>
<p>After a new believer is saved and baptized, it takes about a year for him to go from functioning in the home meetings to functioning in the district meetings. When he begins to function in the district meetings, we can entrust him to the church to be built up in the Body of Christ. He has become a useful member who can go out to gain others. At this point we can go out to care for, lead, and perfect other people. This way can be compared to a master leading an apprentice. Many believers can be perfected this way. The Lord has led us to take the new way. This way is an organic way; therefore, the people gained in this way will spontaneously be organic. When we visit people to preach the gospel, we give them the grace that we have received. This grace has a life power and an organic function. If we continue to function in this way, the Body of Christ will be manifested in our local church. Our local church will be an expression of the universal Body of Christ functioning in a locality. It will be an organism, not an organization.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE PRACTICING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>We all love the Lord, and we care for His move. We know that the Lord wants to build up His Body and that the building up of the Body of Christ is not something that only a small number of gifted persons can accomplish. The building up of the Body of Christ requires all those who belong to the Lord to be constrained by His love to function together by visiting people to preach the gospel, by perfecting new believers, by establishing group meetings, and by functioning in district meetings. This is the only way for the Body of Christ to be built up.</p>
<p>The steps for the practice of the new way are set before us, and they are our heavenly duty. If one thousand saints in the church in Taipei receive this word and are willing to pay the price to spend their energy and practice the new way, the condition of the church will improve and the church will spread. At the same time, the Body of Christ will be built up.</p>
<p>In a local church with just one hundred people, we hope that thirty saints will be constrained by the Lord to rise up and accept the Lord&rsquo;s leading to practice the new way. These saints should form teams of three people that include an older person, a middle-aged person, and a young person. There should be brothers and sisters on each team who coordinate to visit people and preach the gospel. If the saints on a team go out at least once every other week for two hours each time, they will be able to lead one person to salvation in a month. In twelve months they will bring twelve people to salvation. This means that in one year ten teams can lead one hundred twenty people to salvation. The saints still need to lead the new ones from the home meetings to the group meetings and finally to the district meetings. Even if we lose two out of every four new ones, we should be able to keep sixty new ones. This is a sixty percent annual rate of increase. Furthermore, a locality with one hundred people should be able to support at least two or three full-time serving ones. The full-time serving ones should spend all their time practicing the new way. They should be able to gain fifty people in one year. This gives a total of one hundred ten people in one year. This is a considerable number.</p>
<p>Concerning the regular weekly meetings, we can make the following arrangements. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning we will have district meetings in which we break bread to remember the Lord, study the truth, and fellowship and testify. On Tuesday evening we will have the church prayer and service meeting to call on the Lord and strive together for the practice of the new way. Then on two other evenings during the week we can either visit people to preach the gospel or have home meetings and group meetings to bear the burden of caring for and perfecting the saints. If we are willing to meet in this way and labor faithfully, the church in Taipei will be organic. The entire church life will be organic, not organized. All the saints will participate in the church life, instead of a few people replacing everyone else. This will be a flourishing and blessed situation, and the results will be rich and glorious.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SPREADING<br />
TO THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You for Your leading. We praise You for blessing us. We also praise You for the grace You are exhibiting in the young brothers and sisters. Lord, Your church is looking to You. We are waiting on You and asking You to release Your heart&rsquo;s desire to us so that we may know Your will and touch Your way. We confess that we are unprofitable slaves who lack wisdom and are short in every way. Lord, we really need You. We need You to be our wisdom, our power, our daily grace, and our moment-by-moment strength. The only things that have eternal value are the things that You do through us. We stand against what we are and what we can do. We do not trust in ourselves. We trust in You as the resurrected Lord. We do not want to live in our natural man, and we do not want to do anything by our own strength. Everything we do apart from You is vain and useless. We look to You to operate within us so that we may become one spirit with You and be Your living witnesses. Lord, we are not merely going out to do a work; rather, we are going out as Your witnesses to prove that You are the true and living Lord, who died and resurrected. You denied Yourself and did not live by Your natural life; rather, You lived absolutely in the resurrection life. Care for us that we may live in the same way before You. When we go out, we want to be testimonies of Your resurrection so that the churches we establish will be golden lampstands. Lord Jesus, bless us. We look to You for Your leading that we may touch Your heart&rsquo;s desire. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE MATTERS NEEDING CONSIDERATION</h2>
<p>First, we need to consider how many days the saints should spend in the towns or villages for the spread of the gospel. The saints have spent two months spreading the gospel. Every team spent fifteen days in their first town. Some saints remained in the first town, and the rest of the team went to a second town and spent twenty days there. At the end of the twenty days, some saints remained in the second town, and the rest of the team went to a third town and spent twenty-five days there. Hence, every team went out for a total of sixty days. However, we may not be spending enough time in these places. According to our research, it is not good for us to have too few new ones, and it is difficult to care for too many new ones. Consequently, we should gain between forty and fifty people in every town. We need to beget the right number of new ones in order to properly care for the people we baptize. We need to feed, teach, and perfect them. It is therefore best for the saints to spend twenty-five days in every place. This means that all the teams will go out for two and a half months.</p>
<p>Initially, we said that our intention was to establish a church in the two hundred twenty-seven towns and villages that do not have churches. However, based on the observations of the full-timers who went out for the spread of the gospel, we have had further consideration, because certain places have a low population and the people live far apart. Most of the ones going out for the spread of the gospel are young sisters, and we need to consider their safety in these areas. Consequently, we will probably reduce the number of target localities and not go to all two hundred twenty-seven towns and villages. We will select the more important places and establish churches in them; we can then spread out from these localities in one or two years. Reducing the number of target localities means that the large cities like Taipei will not suffer. Otherwise, we would need to send some of the saints serving in Taipei to the towns and villages. These saints, however, would probably gain more people in Taipei than in the rural areas. Reducing the number of target localities will also enable us to increase the number of days we spend in every town to twenty-five days.</p>
<p>Second, it is not good to take time off during the two and a half months that your team is spreading the gospel. You should remain with your team the entire time. This is the only way we can accomplish the spread. God wants man to work for six days and to rest on the seventh, just as He worked for six days and rested on the seventh day. Hence, you should all consider this matter. Furthermore, when you rest, you should not do anything strenuous. According to the New Testament the Jews had something called &ldquo;a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey&rdquo; (Acts 1:12); they did not walk a long distance on the Sabbath. You need to be restricted on your day of rest and not engage in many activities, such as playing ball and running. If you engage in too many activities, you will be exhausted the next day, and instead of having a day of rest, you will have had a day of labor. To rest simply means to rest. It is best not to travel farther than the distance allowed on the Sabbath, but this is not a legalistic matter. Every team can determine the details for their day of rest according to the situation in their environment. It is best to keep the biblical principle, because the matters permitted in the Bible are beneficial, and the things forbidden in the Bible are not beneficial.</p>
<p>Third, the location of the meeting hall in the new localities must be appropriate. The meeting halls should not be close to major streets, because the noise from passing traffic will make it difficult to have meetings. Furthermore, some towns and villages have two sections; one section is elevated and the other is in a valley. Is it more convenient for the meeting hall to be located in the elevated section or in the valley? If the meeting hall is in the elevated section, everyone will need to walk uphill to the meetings, and if it is in the valley, those who live in the elevated section will need to walk downhill. The valley is a more convenient location. When choosing a location for a meeting hall, we should consider these things.</p><h2 class="head1">GAINING STABLE HOUSEHOLDS</h2>
<p>In our labor in the new localities, we need to gain households, because it is difficult for a church with only single saints to be stable. According to the Bible the practical church life is built up in the homes; hence, we must keep this principle in our work. We must do our best to gain two households with four people in each household. This is better than eight single people. We need to pay attention to this and spend the time necessary to gain families. After a household is baptized, we must spend more time to nourish the family members. We must spend time to perfect every household, just as we perfect and teach individual new believers. Even though a local church with a total of twelve people in six stable households may be small, it will be stable. Furthermore, it is more difficult for an entire household to move than it is for a single person to move. Therefore, there is a need for us to stabilize the households. In every town and village that we go to, we must gain households and maintain a sweet relationship with every family. We will gain many benefits from such a practice. As we go out to the different places to establish churches, we need to remember that the households are the greatest support to the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPENDING MORE TIME TO NOURISH THE NEW ONES</h2>
<p>We spent three terms in the full-time training, one and a half years, to research and experiment how to knock on doors. During that time we spent much time and money, and many people went out every day to knock on doors so that we could know the type of results to expect. In one and a half years we baptized a total of thirty-eight thousand people.</p>
<p>This is a large number of people. These people heard the gospel, confessed their sins, called on the Lord&rsquo;s name, prayed, and received salvation. However, only the Lord knows whether they will enter the kingdom. When we baptize people, we do not have the full assurance that they will enter into the kingdom. Nevertheless, in one and a half years we baptized thirty-eight thousand people.</p>
<p>We have now left the experimental stage, and we are in the stage of practicing. Consequently, our plans for spreading the gospel must be based on how long it takes us to baptize people. This means that a team of twenty people should spend fifteen days to knock on doors and preach the gospel and ten days to set up home meetings. We should not be excited when we baptize many people, because there is still the problem of how to nourish these ones.</p>
<p>It is easy to beget, but it is difficult to nourish. In the past we baptized people within three minutes. We cannot say that this is wrong, but we must consider the consequences. If we continue begetting new ones, who will nourish them? When the teams go to their first town, there are twenty full-timers on the team. However, only two full-timers remain in the new locality when the team goes to the next town. This means that the many new ones become a heavy burden to the two full-timers. If they are unable to care for all the new ones, some of the new ones will be left to die. Up to this point we have only considered baptizing people quickly; we have not considered what will happen to them after they are baptized. It is a problem for the ones we baptize to be left with no one to nourish them.</p>
<p>Hence, we should not be quick to baptize too many people. In every town the teams should have at least ten days to lead home meetings and not knock on doors. This will enable us to stabilize the newly baptized saints. We must labor to preach the gospel and baptize people during the first fifteen days, but we should not baptize too many people. It is best if we baptize only forty to fifty people. For this reason, we should not be too quick to baptize people. Instead, we should speak with them to touch their spirit, and we should listen to them. If a person is a son of peace, we should baptize him immediately.</p>
<p>A person who is baptized too quickly can deny his baptism when we visit him a few days later. In order to avoid this situation, we must learn not to baptize people too quickly. If we baptize only twenty people after laboring for two weeks, we will need to spend more days to gain another twenty people. This may require us to go back to some of the people we have already contacted in order to baptize forty to fifty new ones. Therefore, there must be enough serving ones on every team. This way of laboring is solid.</p>
<p>Some people should be baptized quickly; however, if we are not clear whether we should baptize certain people, we should wait before we baptize them. As the full-timers go out in their teams, we will continue to learn, and we will also adjust our method based on their experience.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING NOT TO EXPRESS OUR OPINIONS QUICKLY</h2>
<p>Everyone has an opinion, unless he is a stone. It is impossible not to have an opinion, and opinions have their place. We are pretending when we withhold our opinion. However, we must express our opinions appropriately and at the right time, or they will generate unnecessary problems. It is best to wait a day before we express an opinion so that we can be sure that we feel peaceful about expressing it. If we do not have the peace, we should not express our opinion; rather, we should wait until we have the peace.</p>
<p>When responding to mail, I often put my letter in an envelope without sealing it. Sometimes I wait two days before I mail a letter, and during the night I consider whether my wording was appropriate and my answers were proper. This is a great protection. I may wait even three days before mailing certain letters. During this time I pray and ask the Lord whether the decisions I made in the letter were correct. It is not wrong for us to have opinions, but we should not be too quick to express them. It is best to wait for some time. The Lord&rsquo;s Spirit will lead us inwardly, and we may even receive a confirmation in the environment.</p>
<p>We may feel that something is right and good, but if we are too quick to express our opinion, we may get a wrong result. According to a proverb, we should hold back half a sentence and not speak it even though what we want to say is at the tip of our tongue. Another proverb says, &ldquo;Diseases enter through the mouth, and misfortunes issue from the mouth.&rdquo; Proverbs 10:19 says, &ldquo;When there are many words transgression does not cease, / But he who restrains his lips is prudent.&rdquo; If we do not exercise restraint when expressing our opinions, we will get into trouble. We should, therefore, do our best not to speak too much, and we should not speak too quickly.</p>
<p>A co-worker who does not speak is being pretentious, or he is being a politician instead of a faithful, coordinating member of the Body of Christ. Members who coordinate faithfully must speak the truth and say what they have seen. However, they should be careful when they express themselves. For example, if we have an opinion while we are in a meeting with others, it is best for us to express it slowly or not at all. Most of the time we are wrong when we express our opinion quickly. Therefore, instead of expressing our opinion, it is best to wait. However, if we are clear, we should speak, but we should not be abrasive in our tone. Our speech should be seasoned with salt (Col. 4:6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SISTERS NEEDING TO STAND FIRMLY<br />
IN THE POSITION OF A SISTER</h2>
<p>In their fellowship the brothers said that some sisters are too strong. Strong sisters are a lesson to the brothers. Our way of dealing with any situation is the cross. In Genesis 45, when Joseph&rsquo;s brothers were returning to Jacob, Joseph charged them not to quarrel on the way (v. 24). To quarrel is to argue, and when we argue, we express our opinion. The best way to overcome our opinions is to refrain from speaking, no matter how strong and stubborn others may be. The sisters may be strong when they express their opinions, but after two hours they are no longer strong.</p>
<p>However, the sisters need to remember that they are sisters. The Bible says that the man is the head of the woman (1 Cor. 11:3). Hence, the sisters must always remember that no matter how strong they may be physically, they are still sisters. Therefore, they should be gentle and exercise restraint when they speak. Instead of speaking eight sentences, they should speak only five. If the sisters can also lower their tone when they speak, others will not feel that they are too strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BROTHERS TAKING THE LEAD<br />
BUT NOT LORDING IT OVER OTHERS</h2>
<p>Some brothers are faithful and diligent to take the lead. Sometimes they are not polite in their dealings with those around them, because they want everything to be perfect. This can cause them to be controlling and to rule over other saints. However, according to the Bible, the elders should only oversee; they should not lord it over others (1 Pet. 5:1-3). Hence, the brothers should only oversee and not rule over the saints. To rule over others is to lord it over them, to exercise lordship, and to enslave the saints. These things are wrong.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the sisters should cover their heads; on the other hand, the brothers need to take the lead. However, the brothers should lead the saints without ruling over them. The Bible says that the brothers should take the lead, and the Bible also says that the sisters are weaker vessels (3:7). The brothers must always be considerate of the sisters as weaker vessels, because they have weaknesses that the brothers do not have. Their weaknesses are according to God&rsquo;s creation. Hence, it is good for the brothers to consider how the sisters were created when they touch any matter related to the sisters. Even though the sisters are also human beings, they are different from brothers. They are different in their constitution and their nature. The brothers should not deal with the sisters as if they are dealing with brothers. In everything the brothers do, they must recognize that the sisters are weaker vessels.</p>
<p>We can hit a board of wood many times without breaking it; however, a pane of glass will break the first time we hit it. In the same way, it does not matter if a brother hits me, because I will not break. However, when we deal with a sister, we must first know her condition before speaking with her. In conclusion, it is proper for the brothers to take the lead, but it is wrong for them to assume the headship. There is only one Head&mdash;our Lord Jesus.</p><h2 class="head1">NOURISHING PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY<br />
AFTER BAPTIZING THEM</h2>
<p>During the time when we were researching how to knock on doors, as soon as a person was baptized and changed his clothes, we would rush out the door to baptize the next person. This is no longer our practice. It is best to spend some time to nourish a person immediately after he is baptized and then go back to visit him the next day. We need to visit the new believers many times during the first month, because it is easy for them to become sick or to die prematurely. It is best to use the first thirty days to stabilize the new believers.</p>
<p>For this reason, those whom we baptize must be visited at least ten times in the first month after their baptism. Otherwise, they may die prematurely. During the past decades we baptized many people, but most of them died prematurely and few have remained, because we did not learn this lesson. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain&rdquo; (John 15:16). The secret to bearing remaining fruit is to nourish them. This can be compared to a baby being fed milk immediately after it is born. After we baptize someone, we must nourish him immediately and then continue to nourish him during the next thirty days.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING A SEPARATING LINE<br />
BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS<br />
IN THE COORDINATION</h2>
<p>Someone asked whether a brother and a sister can coordinate together. This must be avoided. Even though this does not break the law, it violates the principle in the Bible. We must not allow the single brothers and single sisters to have too much personal contact. It is best for them to have as little contact as possible. There should be a distance between the brothers and the sisters. This has been our practice for many decades. We do not approve of two members of the opposite sex being alone together in a room, especially if the door is closed and the room has no windows. This is forbidden. Hence, we should not think that it is a matter of convenience for a brother to give a sister a ride in a car in order for her to do her shopping. It is fine for a brother to accept a ride from a brother and for a sister to accept a ride from another sister, but it is not acceptable for a brother and a sister to ride together alone in a car. It is absolutely against our principles for a single brother and a single sister to do anything together. We must maintain this testimony.</p>
<p>People who have not received the Lord are not concerned when a man and a woman walk together or do something together, but when a brother and a sister walk together, they lose their testimony. However, this does not mean that unbelievers do not have standards concerning male-female relationships. Hence, they criticize the Christians who behave as they do. They know that the morality of Christians is very high and that Christians cannot be like other people. We cannot necessarily do things that other people do, even if it is legal. Some legal things are not up to our standard of morality.</p>
<p>We must not allow a brother and a sister to do things by themselves alone. A husband and wife can go out together, and no one will say anything because they are married. But there should be a distance between a brother and a sister who are not married. Just as the meal offering could not be mingled with honey (Lev. 2:11), the brothers and sisters must have a living testimony.</p>
<p>This is especially important when we go to the towns and villages to preach the gospel, because the neighbors are watching us. They know that we are a group of people who are preaching Jesus, so they will watch us. Therefore, the married saints must have a proper relationship so that other people can see that Christians are different. Male-female relationships are an important aspect of morality. In human ethics and morality the relationship between a husband and wife is crucial. The Bible condemns anything that damages the marital relationship. Nothing damages God&rsquo;s creation and the man God created more than improper relationships between males and females. We must remember this.</p>
<p>Even though I am an old man, I would never allow a sister to take me to get my hair cut when I cannot find a brother to take me. I would rather delay an errand than go against this principle, even though I am already elderly. May we all pay attention to this matter. We cannot avoid contacting people when we serve the Lord; hence, we must maintain a proper testimony when we contact members of the opposite sex. Otherwise, in our service to the Lord, we will encounter problems. We must be very careful in this matter. This especially applies to the brothers. The brothers must remember to keep their contact with the sisters pure and in the light. They should not fall into a situation in which others can criticize them in this area.</p>
<p>Today some women do not seem to have any sense of shame. Shamefacedness is a virtue, and females must have some sense of shame. It is part of the God-created female disposition. It is wrong for a female, especially for a girl who is eighteen or nineteen years old, to be flirtatious or to wear clothing that does not cover her. Women should have a sense of shame. The sisters must remember that they are sisters and that they need to be preserved.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago the China Inland Mission sent many people to China. They sent at least ninety young sisters from England. These young sisters were met by an elderly Western sister in Shanghai whose commission was to help them preach the gospel in China. In those days the young women in the West liked to wear modern skirts that were shorter than the old-fashioned skirts, which were long and reached the floor. This elderly sister would invite the young sisters for afternoon tea and snacks. After tea this elderly sister would spend time to speak with the sisters. While she was speaking, she would continually pull at her skirt below her knees. After pulling at her skirt a few times, the young sisters began pulling at their skirts, because they realized that their skirts were short and did not adequately cover them.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, it is a shame, not a glory, for the fallen human body to be exposed. It is a shame, not a glory, for a person to expose his back or chest. In the Old Testament times women even covered their heads. Today women in Islamic countries cover their entire face. In principle, it is better for less of the body to be exposed. When we cover ourselves, we cover our shame. After the fall man&rsquo;s first sense was to be ashamed of his nakedness; therefore, Adam and Eve made loincloths to cover their shame (Gen. 3:7).</p>
<p>When we go out to spread the gospel, we must be careful. We are all co-workers. In our service it is difficult to avoid contact between brothers and sisters; therefore, we must understand the situation and maintain these principles. Brothers must remain in their position as brothers and not be loose in their speech. Sisters must remember that they are females and keep the feminine virtue of shamefacedness. In this way, the Lord will preserve us.</p><h2 class="head1">NOURISHING AND CARING FOR OTHERS<br />
BEING CRUCIAL</h2>
<p>If the people listening to our gospel are materialistic and despise spiritual things, we should not press them. When we go out to preach the gospel, unless we have much assurance, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s leading, it is best not to force people. The worldly people know that material things are worthless, and some religions even teach separation from the world. Hence, there is no need for us to teach this. The people we speak to may have a successful business, or they may be mature and already know that material things are worthless and that they should not be occupied by them. Hence, it is best if we do not speak about these matters.</p>
<p>Even if we have a clear leading and the spiritual authority to speak a serious word, we still must be careful how we express things. For this reason, it is best to be positive and preach the Lord Jesus. With a new one we can read Philippians 3:8, which says, &ldquo;I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.&rdquo; There is no need to touch the fact that the new ones are materialistic and not spiritual. We should simply speak the truth to them and give the word of the truth the opportunity to shine in them and enlighten them. This will help them.</p>
<p>We should not consider saving people through knocking on doors as the most important item in our work. Instead, we should consider that visiting people to care for them and to nourish them is the most important item. We should not think that when we baptize a person, we have gained him. Baptizing a person is the same as giving birth to a child. We cannot say that our job is finished after a child is born. We must keep him alive by nourishing him. Hence, we must consider caring for people and nourishing them as the crucial items in our work. Wherever we go to spread the gospel, we must pay attention to these items.</p>
<p>If the new ones have the time, we should do our best to spend much time to speak to them. The more time we can spend with them, the better. In principle, those who work for the Lord should have time for the new ones. We should not be in a situation where we do not have enough time, especially since we are going to the towns and villages to speak to people. If a new one is available, we should be happy to spend the time to speak to him, even if we end up speaking to people from six o&rsquo;clock in the morning until six o&rsquo;clock in the evening. The people in the towns and villages are usually not very educated, but we should not despise them and think that the truth is too deep for them to understand. We must not have such a concept. It is also wrong for us to teach only deep truths. In speaking the truth, we must be progressive and not despise anyone. We must respect everyone. In order for people to be edified when we speak, we should speak normally, without adding deep points or speaking shallowly.</p>
<p>When a person says that he is already a Christian, we should learn how to use one or two sentences to find out if he is really saved. If he is genuinely saved, we should check to see if he is open to receive us. If he is not open, we should let him go. If he is open, we should meet with him, just as we meet with a new one in order to nourish and care for him. If we feel that he is not genuinely saved, we should treat him like a gospel friend and help him receive salvation.</p>
<p>We must also strengthen the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings. If the entire team of twenty people is exercised in a meeting, the meeting will be strong. If we are not strong, we should not expect the new ones to be strong. Hence, whether or not the meetings are strong depends on us. This is very important. In a period of twenty-five days we will have at least three Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings with the new ones. We should be a pattern to the new ones in every meeting to help them function in the meetings in the future. We must not be loose in any meeting, and we should bear the responsibility in the meetings. When every team member functions, the meetings will be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S WITNESSES<br />
IN JERUSALEM, JUDEA, SAMARIA, AND<br />
UNTO THE UTTERMOST PART OF THE EARTH</h2>
<p>In addition, when we go out to knock on doors, we are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. In Acts 1:8 the Lord said, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; We are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses. When we preach the gospel, we must begin with Jerusalem as our center, pass through Judea and Samaria, and then go to the uttermost part of the earth. We begin with the center and gradually make our way to the circumference. This means that when we knock on doors, we should take the meeting hall as our center and begin in the areas around the meeting hall. We should not skip the homes that are nearby and look for people who live farther away. Only after we preach the gospel in the areas around the meeting hall, which is our Jerusalem, should we go to Judea, then to Samaria, and finally to the uttermost part of the earth. In this way we will preach the gospel to every part of a town or village.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CONCERNING<br />
THE SPREAD TO THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES<br />
AND FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
THE STEPS OF THE NEW WAY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>
<p><em>Question: After we establish a church in a locality, how should we manage the financial matters?</em></p>
<p>Answer: When dealing with financial matters, it is best to have more than one or two people handling money. It is best for three people to coordinate together for the sake of the testimony. It is even easier to manage financial matters when there are six people on a team. If there are only two people on a team, a local brother or sister should be brought into the coordination. There must be three people present whenever the offering box is opened. In addition, we should have a formal ledger in which we record the date and amount of the general offerings and the designated offerings. Designated offerings include any offerings that need to be passed on to a locality or a saint. Every offering must be clearly recorded in a detailed way. We must also record the total amount of the offerings. Then the three saints responsible should sign under the total amount.</p>
<p>In relation to designated offerings, we must clearly record to whom the offering is designated and when it is delivered to him. If the offering is sent through postal money order, we must retain the money order receipt. A short letter of explanation and a receipt should be enclosed with the money order. The letter of explanation should ask the recipient to sign the receipt and mail it back to us when he receives the funds. The returned receipt and the money order receipt should be filed in our records. These are accounting procedures. In this way, if after three months the saint who made the offering is worried that the offering was not delivered, we can find the record of the offering and show the saint the receipt we received from the recipient. Without such procedures the church will suffer loss if we cannot give the saints a satisfactory answer regarding designated offerings.</p>
<p>In every locality there are many saints who understand accounting; thus, these procedures should not be difficult. Those who serve in this function in the localities should be faithful and keep a detailed record. We should never allow only one person to open the offering box, and there must be a proper place to keep the key to the offering box. We should never carry the key to the box on our person, nor should we allow someone to casually take the key. Of the twelve disciples of the Lord Jesus, Judas was a thief (John 12:4-6). This same problem has also occurred in the church life; therefore, we must be very careful when we deal with money so that we do not fall under suspicion. There must also be a proper record of when the money is deposited. The deposit slips and receipts should be kept as evidence.</p>
<p>The decisions on how to manage the finances of a public organization are quite important. The financial decisions in the new localities should be made by the co-workers on the team plus one or two of the more experienced local saints. They should discuss matters to decide how to use the offerings and then convey any decisions to the accountant. They must not give oral instructions concerning the dispersing of funds, whether by cash or check, to the accountant; rather, they should give the accountant a written record that is signed by two or three saints. The accountant must receive something in writing before he gives cash or writes a check, and he should always obtain a written receipt for every transaction. A petty cash box should also be prepared. The amount of money to be kept as petty cash should be decided by the saints responsible for financial matters. These funds should be given to one person. The amount used for petty cash must be recorded in the general ledger. There must also be an account book to record how the petty cash is spent. The miscellaneous weekly small expenses, which do not require an official approval from the saints responsible for finances, should be taken from the petty cash. For example, if there is a blackout, money can be taken from the petty cash to purchase candles for the meeting hall. It is best to obtain a receipt or a cash register slip for all such purchases. The owners of small shops may not automatically give us a receipt because this will make them liable to pay sales tax. Hence, we should be willing to spend a little more money for the sake of obtaining a receipt; as Christians, we need to be faithful.</p>
<p>We Christians must obey the law and pay taxes, not evade taxes. It is not proper for us to evade taxes in order to save money for the church. A few years ago there was a dispute in a certain locality concerning the funds used in building a meeting hall. After I came back to Taiwan in 1984, I met with the elders, bookkeepers, accountants, and the saints who were involved, and they all felt it was a complicated problem. Therefore, I said that in order to resolve the issue, the church should go through its records and ask a tax authority to assess our records. If we had not paid enough in taxes, we should pay what we owed, and we should gladly pay any fines for delinquent taxes. This suggestion resolved the problem.</p>
<p>If we are careless and do not pay enough in taxes, we must pay the delinquent taxes; we should also be responsible to pay any penalties incurred. In any event, we should not do anything illegal in order to save a few dollars. We must obtain a proper receipt or cash register slip that includes sales tax. This is our Christian testimony to people in the world.</p>
<p><em>Question: We have a burden to perfect some households. Is it appropriate for us to live with these families?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is very good that there is a burden to perfect some households, but with respect to living in their homes, we should be a little reserved. Before we live with a family, we must first observe the relationships between parents and children, between husband and wife, and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. If a brother is going to stay with a family, there must be a husband in the household; a brother cannot stay in the house if the sister&rsquo;s husband is not at home. Likewise, for a sister to stay with a family, the situation in the household must be appropriate. It is best not to stay with a family if the husband and wife argue, because our presence will create more problems. If the wife is absent for a period of time or if she has passed away, even if there are children remaining, a sister should not live there. We should never be alone in a house with a member of the opposite sex. We must avoid such situations.</p>
<p>When we enter the home of a new believer, we must learn how to interact with the people there. Problems easily arise when people live in close quarters. In order to avoid these problems, we must learn some lessons. First, we must be careful how we conduct ourselves. We should be regulated in our schedule and pay attention to close doors and turn off lights. We cannot live in someone&rsquo;s house and remain active into the middle of the night. This will put our host in a difficult situation. Second, we must be diligent and help with the chores. We can sweep the house, tidy the rooms, or clean the bathroom. However, we must not do things on our own; instead, we should do chores according to the habits of the family. Otherwise, it will seem as if we are correcting the family. Neither should we take the broom from our host when she is sweeping. It is best to find another broom and sweep together with our host. It is pleasant to eat with our host, but we should not forget to help wash the dishes. However, we should not take over the dishwashing; we should be alert and quick to help our hosts when they do the dishes. We should also bring our own apron and not expect our host to take off her apron when we want to help with the dishes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not easy to stay in someone&rsquo;s home. Everything is convenient in our own home, where we cannot get into trouble, but it is not so easy when we are in another person&rsquo;s home. There are many ways for us to get into trouble, and we can inadvertently offend people. Therefore, we must give the matter of moving into someone&rsquo;s home careful consideration. We should not take this matter lightly, because it is easy to enter a home, but it may be difficult to leave.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who go out to the rural places to spread the gospel contact people every day; therefore, they must be careful to maintain their standing. They should not carelessly make friends with people, and they should avoid natural affection. Some people have tempers like tigers; they erupt very easily, and no one likes them. Other people are like little lambs, and everyone loves them. No matter what type of person we contact, we should not have natural affection when we serve. We are all brothers and sisters, and there is only love and care for the brothers and sisters among us. Hence, we must not develop friendships out of natural affection. Some sisters have affection for all the sisters they have brought to salvation, and they become good friends with them and even share shoes with them. This is not sinful, but it is too much. It is not appropriate. Some brothers get along very well with other brothers, and they share their shirts with them. Every team will now live in a locality for six months and will have plenty of time to contact the local saints; hence, we must remember that we cannot develop natural affection. We only have the love that exists among the saints. It may be effective to stay in people&rsquo;s homes, but we must be extremely careful when we contact people.</p>
<p><em>Question: How can we maintain a high morale?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Strictly speaking, in our living we should be like the sun that rises at a regular time. The rising and the setting of the sun are not related to any factor of high or low morale. A proper Christian life should also not be based on morale. Does the sun have a high morale or a low morale? The Bible compares Christ to the sun (Mal. 4:2). This means that those who follow Him should be like the sun. Consequently, we should not be affected by morale. The sun rises every day, whether the day is clear, cloudy, or rainy. None of these affect the morale of the sun. The sun rises regularly in the East, and it sets regularly in the West. Proverbs 4:18 says, &ldquo;The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, / Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.&rdquo; We Christians are like the sun, and we should not have a morale that can be lifted up by excitement or emotions. We should be beside ourselves to the Lord (2 Cor. 5:13), as if we are the dawning light which shines brighter and brighter. Judges 5:31 contains a prayer: &ldquo;May those who love Him be like the sun / When it rises in its might.&rdquo; When the sun is in its might, it is &ldquo;beside itself.&rdquo; We should always be beside ourselves, just as the sun is in its might, but this is not related to morale. We are all the shining sun rising in the East; hence, we must be revived every morning. Every morning we must have morning revival.</p>
<p>A proper morale is not a matter of emotions, but this does not mean that we do not have emotions. For example, all true Christians cry; anyone who cannot cry should not be considered a genuine Christian. Even the Lord Jesus cried. Jesus wept in the situation with Martha and Mary at the death of Lazarus (John 11:35), Jesus wept for Jerusalem (Luke 19:41), and He also wept in the garden of Gethsemane before His death (Heb. 5:7). We should consider how long it has been since we cried. This is related to our Christian life. It is wrong to cry all the time; the sisters should avoid crying frequently. However, it is a dreadful matter if a person has never cried after being saved. Frequent crying, however, is an expression of a weak vessel. Crying can be compared to the rain; if it rains frequently, the weather is bad. Hence, we must learn not to cry constantly.</p>
<p><em>Question: How should we help new believers who are under pressure from their relatives?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The Lord Jesus also endured pressure from His relatives, because He did not take the time to eat when He was preaching. The Lord Jesus did not respond to His relatives (Mark 3:20-21, 31-35; Luke 8:19-21). Therefore, we must let new believers know that they should not be concerned about how others treat them and that they must endure persecution. The path we take in following the Lord is different from the path of people in the world. Our relatives are in the world; hence, they will not approve of the way we take. This can be compared to the Israelites and the Egyptians. The Israelites were shepherds, but because this was an abomination to the Egyptians, the two peoples could not be together. The people in the world take a road that is different from the road we take. We should clearly explain to new ones that they must endure persecution. They must also pray for their relatives and believe the Lord&rsquo;s promise: &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&rdquo; (Acts 16:31). We must believe the Lord&rsquo;s word, and we must endure the temporary persecution from our relatives. We should also learn to pay the price.</p>
<p>According to our experience in mainland China, Muslim relatives are the strongest opposers. There are two kinds of Muslims in China, the Han Chinese who converted to Islam and those of the Muslim race. The members of the Muslim race look like Caucasians. It is true that a person from the Muslim race who believes in the Lord can be killed. In Chefoo a Muslim believed in the Lord, and his relatives wanted to kill him, but the Lord protected him. Many people have been martyred for the Lord over the centuries. We should tell their stories to new believers. We should not worry that they will be frightened away; on the contrary, the stories of the martyred saints can stir up new ones and strengthen their faith. As Christians, we should not care for our own lives. Today because many Christians are weak, they preach a weak gospel and have a weak faith. However, the gospel we preach is strong and will stir up much persecution.</p>
<p>The New Testament says that parents will deliver up their children to death, and children will rise up against their parents (Matt. 10:21). Hence, if we want to help new ones take this way, we must testify to them that those who believe in the Lord should not fear hardships, opposition, or persecution. They should consider these matters to be normal.</p>
<p><em>Question: How should we help a new sister whose husband has not believed in the Lord?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The relationship between a husband and wife is mysterious; therefore, we must not make loose decisions regarding their relationship. We should not loosely touch a situation in which the wife believes in the Lord but the husband does not. We should simply preach the gospel and minister Christ. We should exhort the wife to pray for her husband and explain that a change in her behavior is a testimony to her husband and thus is the best way to convince her husband. We should also use the Bible to teach the sister. We can use verses such as 1 Peter 3:1, which says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands, that even if any disobey the word, they will be gained without the word through the manner of life of their wives.&rdquo; A wife&rsquo;s manner of life can become a strong, subduing tool that will cause her husband to submit.</p>
<p>If the husband is saved but the wife is not, we should speak according to the same principle. We should exhort the brother to rely on the Lord and to pray for his wife. If we have the Lord&rsquo;s leading and a word of wisdom, we can say something deeper; however, we should be careful in what we say. In principle, we must be very careful when we touch the situations in the households of other people, especially when it involves the relationship between a husband and wife. All other relationships are easy to deal with, but the relationship between a husband and wife is the most difficult to resolve. Sometimes brothers and sisters will speak openly about the situation in their own homes, but we must be careful because sometimes it is better not to know these things. There have even been situations when sisters who serve have spoken about the things their husbands have done. This is inappropriate and can damage people. Hence, we should never think that getting deeply involved in the family matters of the saints is the way to care for them. It is best if we do not know too much. It is sufficient for us to know that they have problems; we do not need to know all the details. We must be very careful when dealing with the problems between a husband and wife.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STEPS OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The First Step&mdash;Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>We want to fellowship concerning the new way that the Lord has shown us. The new way includes three steps; the first step is preaching the gospel. After four years of thorough research, we have discovered that it is wrong to think that it is best to save more people when we knock on doors to preach the gospel. If our goal were merely to save people from eternal perdition, then it would be better to save more people. However, God wants to gain a group of people among His chosen ones to be the living members of the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body. This Body is not according to the common understanding of the church. In order for the new believers to become living members who are built up together as the Body of Christ, we should not preach a gospel that merely leads people to salvation. We should first consider how many people we can take care of and then preach the gospel to save people according to that number. If we are able to care for four or five people, we should gain seven or eight people through preaching the gospel and give proper care to these seven or eight people.</p>
<p>After one month of caring for the seven or eight new believers, some of them may begin to avoid us even to the extent of denying the Lord. At this point we can knock on more doors to gain more people. There should always be seven or eight people under our care. We must keep this principle. No matter where we go, we should always have seven or eight people under our care. This will not be too many people for us to nourish in home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Second Step&mdash;Nourishing the New Ones</h2>
<p>In caring for the new believers, we should nourish them immediately after they are baptized. Nourishing is the second step of the new way. Immediately after a person is baptized, we should have a home meeting to nourish him. In other words, we should nourish him on the day that he is baptized. It is difficult to understand the function of nourishing, and there are many important details related to nourishing. After we baptize a person, we should stay with him and nourish him in an organic way. We should not be formal; rather, we should calmly fellowship with him and explain that we call him a brother because he is a member of the household of God.</p>
<p>We must help the new believers know that the Lord Jesus died on the cross by giving up His body and shedding His blood for us in order to become our Savior. He passed through death, burial, and resurrection. In His resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit to enter into those who believe into Him and who receive Him. When we call on the Lord, the Spirit enters into us to give us a sweet, pleasant feeling. This is an experience we did not have before we were saved, and it proves that we are saved. The inward sense that the Lord gives when we call on His name is His operation within us. When we call on the Lord, we are breathing, just as we breathe in fresh air.</p>
<p>We should also let the new believers know that they have a spirit within them. God is Spirit, and we have a spirit; hence, we touch the Spirit and contact the Lord by calling on the name of the Lord. We should not use our mind, our thoughts, or our emotions to call; rather, we must call from our spirit. From the deepest part of our being we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This kind of calling on the Lord is also praying.</p>
<p>While a new one is calling on the Lord, we should encourage him to express what is in his heart. If he feels that he wronged his mother in the past, he can call on the Lord and confess his sin. If he feels thankful for all that the Lord has arranged, he should offer thanks to the Lord. There is no formal rule concerning prayer. We simply help the new one know that the Lord is the Spirit, that he has a spirit, and that by exercising his spirit he can contact the Lord Spirit. We should lead him to pray in this way and then explain prayer to him. Then we should lead him to pray again and speak some more. In this way he will be nourished and perfected.</p>
<p>There are no regulations or forms in the home meetings. We should simply speak freely with the new ones. The meeting should not last longer than one and a half hours, but this is not a regulation. It is better to nourish a new one immediately after he is baptized than to wait and nourish him one week after his baptism. Furthermore, after a person is baptized, we should tell him that the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting is important and invite him to attend the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting to worship the Lord with us. We should even visit him before the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In this way we will have our third contact with him on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. It is easy to retain people if we practice in this way, and the ones we contact will be solid.</p>
<p>Next, we need to make appointments to have regular home meetings with the new ones. The new ones may be willing to have a meeting three times a week. They may want to meet every other day, or they may want to meet twice a week. In the home meetings we must get rid of the old way of meeting and the ordinances. We must not give the new ones the impression that there are regulations or rituals in the home meetings. From the first meeting we must give them the impression that Christian meetings are in the spirit and that everyone worships, prays, and calls on the Lord in spirit. Then when a new one is by himself, he will know how to pray in spirit and how to call on the Lord. In Matthew 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;Where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; (v. 20). There are no rituals when we gather together. Sometimes we begin the meeting with prayer, at other times we may read a few verses, and at still other times we may sing a hymn. No matter how we begin the meeting, the prayer, reading, or singing must be living, not stiff. Let us take singing as an example. There is no need to sing a hymn from beginning to end; we may sing only one verse. The important thing is to be living. If we meet in this way, after two or three months the new ones will be able to do what we do. They will go out and help others in the same way that we helped them.</p>
<p>As we contact new ones, they will open themselves to us. Perhaps they will ask us questions. They may ask what they should do about the worship of ancestors. We must answer these questions seriously; we should not merely feed the new ones without teaching them. We may say, &ldquo;There is only one God in the universe, and He is Jesus in whom we have believed. He should obtain all our worship. We respect our ancestors, but we should not worship them, because worship is reserved for God alone. We worship only God, and we respect our ancestors and our parents. Chinese people often speak of doing great things to glorify our ancestors, and the best way to glorify our ancestors is to do honorable things. Only the Lord within us can give us the power to do honorable things and to make us upright people. This is the only proper way to glorify our ancestors.&rdquo; In this way we help the new ones with the truth.</p>
<p>The new ones may ask how to deal with their statues of Buddha. We must help them to see that their statues are idols, and that Satan, the devil, is behind every idol. On the one hand, we must speak the truth to them, and on the other hand, we must lead them to clear the past. We should quote some verses in the Bible and show them the verses. We may use Exodus 20:3-5, which says, &ldquo;You shall have no other gods before Me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, nor the form of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water beneath the earth. You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them.&rdquo; This will help the new ones grow in life. The new ones may ask us a question at any time, so we must be prepared before we go to visit them. If they do not have any questions, we can ask them a question. When we sing hymns, we should not be formal and stiff. We can even begin singing on the way to visit the new ones. We do not need to wait to enter their door before we sing. We must be living in everything we do.</p><h2 class="head2">The Third Step&mdash;Establishing the Small Groups</h2>
<p>After meeting with the new ones in this way, we should bring them to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting and to the small group meeting. This is the third step. If several households in a neighborhood are saved, we can introduce them to one another and help them to visit one another. Then we should help them gather together for a small group meeting. There is no need to make arrangements in advance concerning the time to meet or in whose house to meet. We should drop the old traditional, legalistic way of doing things. If a few families cannot meet together at one time, two households can meet together. This is a sufficient number to begin a small group meeting. We need to break through all the forms of worship to have new and living meetings.</p>
<p>In the small groups the first thing we should do is fellowship with one another. We must lead the new ones into fellowshipping together. When everyone comes together, we must fellowship by asking others questions and answering questions concerning ourselves. After the fellowship we should pray and then visit another household. The small group meeting should begin in one home and end in a second home. When we knock on the door of the second home, we can begin singing a hymn while we are still standing outside the door. This will cause the people inside to have a spontaneous response. This is true morale. When everyone is sitting down, we can fellowship about the problems we encountered that day and pray for one another. After the prayer we should help the new ones to care for one another. For example, if someone is sick, we should pray for him and show concern for his health. This is the way to care for one another. If anyone has any questions after this, everyone can participate to answer the questions. Such meetings will not be stiff and formal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we should not wait for anyone to take the lead in the small group meetings, nor should we wait for others to begin speaking. Every person can speak; hence, there is no need to make any arrangements or follow any rituals. Everyone should function organically. After fellowshipping, we must pray. Prayer will produce an atmosphere of mutual care. If there are any questions, everyone should participate in answering the questions. No specific person should answer all the questions; rather, every attendant in the meeting can say something. If the new ones wait for us to answer the question, we should encourage them to answer the question and not wait for us. When we do respond, we should be brief and speak clearly. We must avoid having one person give the entire answer. If only one person answers a question, he will occupy the entire meeting, and others will not have the opportunity to speak. Hence, every person should only take about three minutes to answer a question. After one person speaks, another person should add something, and then another can add more. In this way, everyone will have an opportunity to speak, and the riches within the saints will spontaneously come forth.</p>
<p>We must develop the habit of allowing everyone to speak freely and to exercise his spirit. This requires much learning. Even though we use the term <em>small group,</em> it is possible that we do not have the proper understanding of a small group. The local churches have not fully turned in this matter.</p>
<p>We can learn the truth through the mutual asking of questions in the small group meetings. This will bring in the pursuit of life. This means that the small group meetings have mutual fellowship, mutual prayer, mutual care, mutual learning of the truth, and the mutual pursuit of life. These are the five items of the small group meetings. The content of the small groups is broad and all-inclusive. If a small group meets fifty-two times in one year, and if the members learn something every time they meet, that meeting will spontaneously produce teachers. Furthermore, there should not be too many saints meeting in the small group meetings. At the most there should be twenty people. This will give everyone a chance to function.</p>
<p>A new believer may ask, &ldquo;Why is the Lord Jesus the Lord and Jesus and Christ? What is the meaning of these names?&rdquo; Everyone who is in the meeting should speak a little to answer the question. Perhaps one brother will say, &ldquo;He is the Lord of heaven and earth. He is the Creator; hence, He is the Lord. No founder of a religion has ever dared to call himself the lord. Confucius and Mohammed never dared to say that they were lord because only Jesus is the Lord.&rdquo; Then another brother may add, &ldquo;Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we did not have a lord. In addition, only believing in the Lord Jesus is called believing in the Lord, because in the entire universe only He is Lord.&rdquo; Then a sister might add, &ldquo;I can testify that before I believed, my husband was unable to be my lord even though he was very good to me. I had to bear so many things by myself. Today I am saved, and I have the Lord; no matter what problem I encounter, the Lord can lead me through it.&rdquo; These words are both testimonies and teachings.</p>
<p>The truth among us is very rich. Another brother may add, &ldquo;The name Jesus means &lsquo;Jehovah the Savior&rsquo; or &lsquo;the salvation of Jehovah.&rsquo;&rdquo; Another saint might continue and say, &ldquo;<em>Jesus</em> is the Greek word for the Hebrew word <em>Joshua.</em> Joshua brought the Israelites into the good land of Canaan, where they obtained all the riches of the land. Hence, Jesus is not merely our Savior; He is also our Joshua, who leads us into the good land of Canaan to enjoy all its riches.&rdquo; Then another person may say, &ldquo;<em>Christ</em> means &lsquo;the anointed One.&rsquo; In Greek His name is Christ, and in Hebrew it is Messiah. God anointed Him, so today He is our Lord, our Savior, our Joshua, and our anointed One. All of God&rsquo;s riches are in Him, and because we are members of His Body, His anointing also reaches us.&rdquo; Such short answers are very rich, and they will nourish the new ones and build them up.</p>
<p>Some of the saints among us may have listened to messages for twenty years or more, but they still cannot explain what it means for Jesus to be the Lord or what the name Jesus means. However, after attending such small group meetings, all the saints, regardless of how long they have been saved, will have a clear understanding of what <em>Jesus</em> means and what <em>Christ</em> means. These answers do not merely teach the truth; they also contain the supply of life. At the end of the small group meeting a more experienced brother can add a few words to explain that the Lord Jesus Christ is God, even the embodiment of the processed Triune God. When we speak in this way, we are prophesying. Then in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting we can use three minutes to speak this prophecy again so that all the brothers and sisters will be edified.</p>
<p>Such a small group meeting is different from the small group meetings we held in the past. Those who bear responsibility in the small group meetings can learn how to lead their group according to its condition. If a group lacks new ones, we suggest that the group preach the gospel by knocking on doors in order to gain new ones and have people to visit. By doing this, we promote the gospel. Or we can visit the saints who are ill or the brothers and sisters who have not been in the meetings for a long time. A group meeting can divide into teams in order to visit people. If someone has missed the meeting for two or three weeks, we can arrange for someone in the group to bear the responsibility of caring for him. In general, every aspect in the practice of the church life must be done in the small groups. The potential of the small groups is limitless. If we practice the small groups in this way, we will have the increase; we will preach the gospel, visit people, and care for people. When the number of those attending our small group increases, we can split the group into two smaller groups.</p>
<p>After six months of meeting in this way, the new ones will learn how to meet in the small groups, and they will also be clear about what they need to do. After the group is split and two new groups are established, we can go out and lead more new people to salvation. After another six months we will again be ready to split the group meeting. Then what began as one group meeting will become three or four groups. This is the spread and the increase of the church. In this way the church will continue to increase.</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel, having home meetings, and having the small group meetings constitute the church life. After six months of meeting in this way in a small group, everyone will know one another, and we can split the group in order to maintain the freshness. Otherwise, an old flavor may creep into the meeting. If the group is split, the members will still have a fresh relationship when they see one another on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Related to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings, there should not be too many saints in the meeting. A meeting with forty or fifty people is large enough. Then the meetings will be fresh and living, and everyone will have many opportunities to function. The gospel teams that go out to the rural places to raise up churches must take this way.</p><h2 class="head1">FORMING NEW GOSPEL TEAMS</h2>
<p>The new gospel teams will now be composed of six people. These six people will spread the gospel in one town. The brothers coordinating the gospel work in Taiwan decided that every locality where we are spreading the gospel will be given a van. The brothers are in the process of locating places for the gospel teams to live and are obtaining vans. We hope to establish at least one hundred localities, and we want every locality to have a van. There will also be slogans painted on the van that say, &ldquo;God loves the world&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo; When we have a large blending meeting, saints from the new localities can come in their gospel vans.</p>
<p>Every team will live in a locality for six months. If five or six local saints can join a team, the team can divide into two teams. However, we should not depend on the local saints. It is best to let them volunteer to coordinate with us. If they do not volunteer, we should continue our labor. In principle, the six people on a team will split into two groups and knock on doors five days a week. We should immediately establish a home meeting in the homes of the new ones. If we will practice this, by the seventh week we will have at least sixty new believers, and we will not need to continue knocking on doors. We must then lead these new ones in the home meetings and the small group meetings. After meeting with the new ones for four weeks in home meetings and small group meetings, they will be firmly established, and at least two-thirds of them will remain and stand for the Lord.</p>
<p>If we baptize too many people, we will be unable to spend sufficient time to labor on them, and therefore there will be no way to keep them. According to our statistics, about one-fourth of the people who are baptized remain and come to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings. In other words, we may baptize forty people, but less than ten come to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings. The rest of the ones who are baptized do not remain, because we do not have enough serving ones to spend sufficient time to labor on them. Therefore, after much consideration we have decided that we must substitute time for manpower. Instead of having a team of twenty people spend twenty-five days to preach the gospel in one place, we will have a team of six people spend six months in one place.</p>
<p>If the six people laboring in a locality lead sixty people to salvation, they must spend the time to labor on the new ones and raise them up. After half a year they should be able to retain forty or fifty people. Then a church will be established, and these forty to fifty people will be remaining fruit. After meeting with the new ones in home meetings and small group meetings for another six months, the new ones will be perfected and can &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; to do the same things that the team members do.</p>
<p>This time there will be a total of sixteen teams. After half a year each team will send back four people, and two people will remain in the new locality. This means that sixty-four serving ones will return and thirty-two will remain. Every newly established church should have forty new ones. Hence, there will be a total of six hundred forty new ones in sixteen localities. The thirty-two serving ones who remain in the localities will lead the six hundred forty new ones. This should not be too difficult. At least thirty new ones in the new localities should be able to do the same things that the full-timers do. Hence, the sisters should not be too concerned as to whether they remain in a new locality or return. The six people on a team must be built together and strive together for the spread of the gospel. They must also support one another, and they must know all the new believers. In this way, when some of the team members leave, the ones who remain will not be strangers to the new ones. Everyone will know everyone else.</p>
<p>During the coordination in the teams, the sisters frequently speak too much and have strong opinions. Actually, we all have this sickness. However, this makes it difficult for the team leaders, and they are troubled. The team leaders fellowshipped with me about this problem. Initially, everyone in the team is polite, but as the members spend more time together, everyone&rsquo;s peculiarities are manifested. Therefore, we must exercise to learn the lessons of life. The initial time in the teams is a honeymoon. Consequently, we are able to get along. However, as time goes on we begin to argue and are miserable. In order to avoid the arguing, we must be in life; otherwise, even if everyone signs a contract agreeing not to argue, it will not help.</p>
<p>For this reason, we no longer want to have teams with twenty people. Everyone will be reassigned to teams of six people, and each team will have a nice house and a van. It will not be appropriate for the arguing to continue. Furthermore, the brothers must be more polite to the sisters and not lord it over them. The brothers must give the sisters some freedom. It is not a problem for the brothers to oversee, but they should not lord it over anyone. We should try this way to see how it works. If after a period of time things still do not work, we can make further adjustments. We hope that we can resolve our many practical problems and difficulties so that we will have the peace to labor. The brothers have made all the preparations for the teams so that the teams can gain the results.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we go out to spread the gospel, we should take some ministry books with us. These books are not for us to sell and make money but for us to use as tools. We must use the literature as helpful tools because everyone is literate.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SPREAD OF THE GOSPEL<br />
AND THE GOAL OF THE NEW WAY</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPELIZATION OF TAIWAN</h2>
<p>We are full of joy and thanksgiving to the Lord that in an age in which everyone loves himself and desires a prosperous future, one hundred thirty saints are willing to disregard their future for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s interest and go to the towns and villages for the spread of the gospel. The first group that went out consisted of one hundred saints. Recently, thirty more saints joined them. This brings the total to one hundred thirty saints.</p>
<p>By being willing to take this narrow way to witness for the Lord, these young saints have shown that they are absolute and consecrated to the Lord. In addition, their testimonies show that their work in the spread of the gospel has been effective. They did not go out to speak empty words or abstract ideas. Rather, their speaking enabled the Holy Spirit to work in people, and this operation of the Spirit caused people to change. The testimonies of these young saints also show that they are gospel propagators and that the Lord is in them. They are full of Christ. When they went out to preach the gospel and lead sinners to salvation, they were distributing, dispensing, Christ into people. The Christ who is in these young saints is the real Fruit-bearer. He is the enlarging One, the multiplying One. He is the One establishing the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT SITUATION OF<br />
THE WORK OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The first wave of saints raised up fifteen churches in sixty days. On average, they baptized fifty people in each locality. According to their records, the full-timers baptized seven hundred fifty to eight hundred people in two months. A little less than one-fourth of the people they baptized are remaining fruit; that is, they are in the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting and have entered the church life. This means that there are about one hundred fifty new ones in fifteen new churches.</p>
<p>In addition to the new ones, there are some brothers and sisters who formerly were scattered. These brothers and sisters were like orphans without a home or without a proper dwelling place, because there was no church in their town. But the one hundred full-timers went to the towns and villages and established fifteen churches in two months. Consequently, the scattered saints have found a dwelling place in the new churches; they have returned home. Hence, in every new locality there are local saints in addition to new believers. In some places there are only a few local saints, but in other places there are more than twenty local saints. These fifteen places now bear the testimony of the golden lampstand; that is, there is a church in these localities. We believe that by the end of this year, there will be a twofold increase in these new localities. This is the present situation of the spread.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING<br />
HOW TO IMPROVE THE PRESENT SPREADING</h2>
<p>In considering the practical situation, we feel that there is much room for improvement; we need to endeavor to do better. We will first reduce the number of persons on each team from twenty to six. In addition, every team will have a base. The saints responsible for making arrangements are renting and furnishing places that will be suitable to use as a base. By the time the second wave of saints is ready to set out, there will be twelve towns or villages ready for them. The second wave will have twelve teams with six members on each team. This is a total of seventy-two people.</p>
<p>The first wave consisted of one hundred full-timers. We estimated that they could establish fifteen churches in two months. After a locality was raised up, two full-timers remained in the new locality to continue laboring. This means that thirty saints remained in fifteen new localities. After the new localities were raised up, an additional thirty full-timers joined the labor. Therefore, there are a total of one hundred thirty saints laboring on the island of Taiwan for the propagation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. These saints are about the same age and are balanced in every aspect. We should all rejoice and give thanks to the Lord for these saints.</p>
<p>We dare not say that such a spread of the gospel is an unprecedented move for Christianity in the Far East, but we can say that at least in Taiwan, such a move has never occurred before. One hundred thirty young saints are willing to hand themselves over for the propagation of the gospel. These are college graduates who have gone through substantial spiritual training and are willing to come forth for the Lord&rsquo;s move. It is truly marvelous that in this day and age so many full-time serving ones can be produced from among college graduates.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons I returned to Taiwan in 1984. America is a large country with numerous colleges and universities, but because the universities are scattered, it was difficult for us to concentrate our work in one place. However, the Lord has particularly blessed the situation in Taiwan, in that the island is small, and the people are educated. As a result, it is easy to concentrate our effort on the campuses. For this reason, we have been able to gain hundreds of college students in Taiwan. If it were not for the hundreds of college students who are joining Calvary&rsquo;s hosts, the Lord&rsquo;s spreading work would not be able to proceed.</p>
<p>In August 1986 we began the first term of the full-time training. There were two terms in 1987 and also in 1988. We have finished five terms, and we are presently in the sixth term. Several hundred brothers and sisters were gained through the first five terms. Prior to the current move for the spread of the gospel, some saints returned to their jobs after the training. Even though it will not be easy to locate these saints now, we can use them as reserves. When the need arises, they can be enlisted. From this we can see the Lord&rsquo;s sovereign preparation.</p>
<p>Our heart rejoices to see one hundred thirty college graduates who are trained and can be sent to labor in various places. In the past decades we labored much on the campuses, but we never saw such a sight. This is different from our scattered labor of the past, in which everyone did his own work. Now we are trained, and we go out in teams. Moreover, before the saints go to specific destinations, there is detailed planning, much prayer, and sufficient preparation. Then the saints are sent out at the same time.</p>
<p>Within two months we saw the effectiveness of this work. We are full of thanksgiving, but we feel that there is still the need for improvement. Therefore, we are reducing the size of the teams from twenty people to six. Even though we have one hundred thirty young people laboring in the spread of the gospel, and they have already spread to fifteen places, giving us fifteen bases, we have insufficient manpower to guard what has been established. This is our present problem. Therefore, the additional thirty brothers and sisters will be used to strengthen the fifteen bases. This will give us four full-timers in every locality to care for the new church. Initially, some places had only two young sisters overseeing the new church but no brothers. This situation made it difficult to care for the new saints, and it caused concern for the security of the sisters. Now two more saints are being added in each place, and this doubles the manpower to labor together in coordination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from now on the four people in each base will not be moved to another place; they will labor in one place for four months. It is rather precarious for newborn babies to have their nannies changed frequently. Hence, we are adding two more &ldquo;nannies&rdquo; to each team. The original two &ldquo;nannies&rdquo; already have two months of experience. Four saints will now labor continuously for four months, and they will not take a leave of absence without a legitimate reason so that the ones who are under their care can grow normally.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In every place where the spread is going on, there are about forty to fifty newly baptized believers. The four full-timers need to work on these new ones until they are stable. The full-timers should persistently work on them step by step. After that the full-timers can knock on doors and gain more new ones. The number of new ones should increase steadily over time. We hope that after four months there will be about forty saints in each locality who are regular and steady in the church life. We can then move two of the full-timers to another place, and two can remain in the new locality for the long term. We hope that in every locality some saints would be produced as responsible ones and that several suitable homes would be available for the church life. These new saints will be able to bear the local burden with the serving ones.</p>
<p>As we said earlier, accommodations in the twelve new bases are ready for the second wave of full-timers; hence, the second wave can set out immediately. Twelve teams with six members each will labor in these twelve places for four months. In other words, a total of seventy-two persons will labor in twelve bases for four months. This means that after four months we will have spread to a total of twenty-seven new places on the island of Taiwan. There are four full-timers stationed in each of the initial fifteen places, and the twelve new places will have six full-timers each. Each of the first fifteen places had two people laboring in them for two months, and they will have four people laboring in them for another four months. In this way the manpower is balanced and evenly distributed in every place. This is the situation of the twenty-seven new places for the spread.</p>
<p>If we continue spreading according to this pattern, in 1991 we will conclude this stage in the work of evangelizing Taiwan. There will be one hundred newly established churches and two full-time serving ones in every church for a total of two hundred full-timers. We began with one hundred full-timers and an additional thirty full-timers joined them. We need to continue adding more full-timers until there are two hundred full-timers laboring in the new churches. We should send the full-timers out in waves. In 1991 there will be one hundred new churches with two serving ones stationed in every church. This will bring us to the end of the first stage of evangelizing Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE GOSPEL OVERSEAS</h2>
<p>By the end of 1991 there will be two hundred trained young brothers and sisters in one hundred new churches. Depending on our need and the situation, we will then decide whether we should continue the spread. We are presently laboring mainly in larger townships that have a population of over thirty thousand people. Later we will labor in the towns that have a population of over ten thousand people. In most of these smaller towns people tend to be scattered instead of living in clusters; hence, we feel that it may not be effective to establish bases for the work in these towns. Our future direction will be to use the one hundred churches as bases and spread out from them. This will be the second stage of evangelizing Taiwan.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the full-timers who graduate from the full-time training will most likely stay in Taipei. We hope that they will form teams of six to labor in the various communities in Taipei, just like the full-timers who are laboring in the towns and villages. The labor of the full-timers in Taipei to gain enough fruit for a district meeting will be equivalent to establishing a church in one of the towns. Furthermore, the newly trained graduates can also replace those who have labored six months or longer in the towns and villages. This will release some from the first wave of full-timers to go overseas. The United States will be the first place that they will go to labor overseas. All the full-timers should be prepared to learn either English or Spanish. Then after the full-timers have labored in America for a few years, perhaps some can go to the Spanish-speaking countries where there is a vast field for the work.</p>
<p>There are many colleges and universities in Taiwan, and people on this small island live in a clustered environment. This makes it easy to spread the gospel and to gain college graduates who can receive the full-time training. This spontaneously makes Taiwan a place that can produce full-time workers. I believe that in six or seven years there will be three to five hundred full-timers going out from Taiwan; some will go to North America, others to Central and South America, and still others to Africa. In this way we will be able to evangelize not only Taiwan but also the Americas and even all of Africa. This is a good prospect, and we should all endeavor toward this prospect. In particular, those who are laboring on the campuses in Taiwan need to gain college students with this in view.</p>
<p>We hope that the full-time training will produce at least sixty full-timers every year. After five or six years three to five hundred saints will have gone through the training. These saints should go to various places for the spread of the gospel. The &ldquo;apprentices&rdquo; can be produced in Taiwan. After these apprentices receive the training, they will go to the towns and villages to labor for six months to one year, and then they will go to labor overseas. Every new group of apprentices who are raised up will follow in the footsteps of those who have gone before them. This will be a blessing to the island of Taiwan. We hope that in relation to this spread all the churches will be in coordination and that all the co-workers will understand that this is our goal. Then the churches in Taiwan can enter into an atmosphere of propagation and increase for God&rsquo;s pleasure and satisfaction. Furthermore, through this process some saints will mature in their experience and growth in life, and their human experience will reach a certain measure of maturity. The trainees who mature can be sent overseas to evangelize Latin America and Africa. May the Lord fulfill this plan.</p><h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL PROBLEMS IN SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We need to consider two practical problems that we have encountered. First, as much as possible we must avoid the practice of sisters baptizing people. When we knock on doors, we should not let the sisters baptize males, but the sisters can be allowed to baptize females. Suppose after preaching the gospel in a home that both the husband and the wife are willing to be baptized. The sisters can baptize the wife, and if there is no brother present, the sisters should make an arrangement for the husband to be baptized later. They can even arrange for the husband to be baptized in the meeting hall. Under no circumstance is it appropriate for our young sisters to baptize a male. Even if the sister is older, it is still not appropriate for her to baptize a male. During baptism, a person&rsquo;s clothing might not cover his entire body. It is therefore best to avoid such a situation.</p>
<p>Second, I hope that every locality will have a gospel van and a telephone. The first wave of saints who went to the towns and villages were equipped with two ten-passenger vans per team. In every locality there should be at least one ten-passenger van. Transportation in the rural areas is not convenient; buses do not run frequently. Therefore, these vans can be used to transport saints. Most saints do not own cars, and it may take them one or two hours to walk to the meeting. This is burdensome. It would be wonderful to have a vehicle that can transport ten saints to the meeting in one trip. In a locality where forty people meet together, if half of them require a ride, we will only need to make two trips. This is needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if each of the one hundred newly established churches has a van, there will be one hundred gospel vans. The vans will all be of the same make and the same shape with a logo, such as &ldquo;God loves the world&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; painted on them. When these one hundred vans travel from town to town, the townspeople will know that these are the gospel vans of the local churches.</p>
<p>Every church must have a van and a telephone. Then when the sisters go to preach the gospel and a person is willing to be baptized, they can contact the brothers to come and assist them in the baptism. These are some matters that we should pay attention to and for which we should be prepared.</p>
<p>In addition, we should not be timid or frightened when we preach the gospel to people who are older, more experienced, rather accomplished, or famous. We should not feel that we are too young, inexperienced, or unqualified to speak to them. We should be bold and speak Christ to everyone. We should preach the gospel and dispense Christ. Even if the person we are speaking to is the head of a big company or a college professor with a wealth of human experiences, he does not have Christ or the experience of Christ. We can boast that we have Christ. They may have something that they can boast of, but we have even more of which to boast.</p>
<p>We should simply present Christ to people. This should be our exercise and our practice. In Philippians 3:8 Paul said, &ldquo;I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.&rdquo; This verse should help us deal with different kinds of people. We should read Philippians 3 and pray over the verses to apply these verses to ourselves. We need to experience Christ as our riches and as everything to us. I trust that this experience will help us in speaking to people who have positions in society.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STEPS OF THE WORK OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>By improving our arrangement in the work and by taking care of housing, we have taken care of the full-timers in every way. However, we are still concerned about the steps of our work. The record in the Bible shows that there are four major steps in a Christian&rsquo;s work for Christ. The first step is to preach the gospel. The second step is to nourish people after they are saved. The third step is to gather the new believers whom we are nourishing into small group meetings so that they may know one another in the Lord and fellowship together. A small group can begin with seven or eight people and gradually increase in number until it can be split into two groups. The fourth step is to bring the new ones to participate in the church life. In particular, we must bring them to the big meeting on Lord&rsquo;s Day morning for them to practice prophesying together with all the saints.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we need to preach the gospel to lead people to salvation, and we need to nourish the new believers. Then we should connect a new one with eight or nine others in a small group for mutual care and perfecting. We also need to bring the new believers to the church meetings. In particular, they need to prophesy in the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting for the building up of the church. In the past we emphasized knocking on doors to visit people and baptize them, but now we must emphasize these four steps.</p><h2 class="head1">THE USE OF OUR TIME</h2>
<p>When the full-timers were in the training, Monday was always a day off. However, during our time to spread the gospel, if we use this day to go on an outing, we will not get any rest, and we will be more exhausted afterwards. In the Old Testament the children of Israel kept the Sabbath. On this day they were not allowed to walk very far; hence, in Acts there is the phrase <em>a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey</em> (1:12). We must not follow the way of people in the world and go on an outing as soon as we have a day off. After going on an outing, people are generally exhausted, and they do not have the energy to go to work or school the next day. This is the wrong way to spend our day off.</p>
<p>The full-timers are busy working from Tuesday through Saturday, and they are busy meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Moreover, their pursuit is mainly corporate. Hence, they need one day every week to be calm before the Lord in personal prayer in order to contact and fellowship with the Lord. There is a genuine need for the full-timers to spend one day in personal fellowship with the Lord. In addition to this, they also have miscellaneous personal matters to take care of, for example, taking their clothes to be cleaned and buying personal items. These things should be done on Monday, on their day off. This does not mean that they cannot sit in a park or take a walk but rather that they should not go too far or exhaust themselves. A place that is close by and quiet is all that is needed to fellowship with the Lord. They can also visit their family to take care of family matters. In summary, the full-timers should not walk farther than a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey, because this violates the principle of rest.</p>
<p>The full-timers should spend their mornings reading the Bible, studying the truth, or reading spiritual books for the pursuit of life. They should also spend some time to learn a foreign language. The more languages a servant of the Lord knows, the better. For example, if I had not labored diligently to learn English seventy years ago when I lived in China, I would be unable to deal with our present situation. The present need is for the full-timers to learn English, Spanish, and other languages. Those with a burden for Korea should learn Korean. Korea needs a group of Chinese brothers and sisters to join them in the coordination. This also applies to Japan. However, the most important languages are English and Spanish; English is the common language of the world, and there are many Spanish-speaking people in the world. In addition to this, the trainees must continue to improve their Chinese. Perhaps the Lord will use them in the future for the publication work. In any event, those who want to serve the Lord must spend time to learn languages.</p>
<p>The full-timers should use their afternoons and evenings for the work. They should use their time to go out and knock on doors if they do not have a prayer meeting or a small group meeting. They should go out five days a week in gospel teams of three saints. If one gospel team of three can gain five people in one week, the entire team of six saints can gain ten people. If the teams gain ten people in one week, they should be able to gain one hundred people in the first ten weeks. However, this number will be reduced because the full-timers will need to nourish the newly baptized believers in home meetings immediately after they are gained. They will also need to help these new ones form small groups. Hence, the full-timers will spend their time spreading the gospel through three activities: preaching the gospel by knocking on doors, nourishing the new ones in home meetings, and teaching and perfecting the new ones in small group meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING OUR BEST TO NOURISH, PERFECT, TEACH,<br />
AND CULTIVATE THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>It is possible for the full-timers to baptize seventy or eighty people in ten weeks. The second wave of teams will spend a total of one hundred twenty days to spread the gospel. During the first seventy days, or ten weeks, the teams should emphasize knocking on doors. The teams do not need to knock on doors during the remaining fifty days. However, this is not legal. It is possible that more people will be baptized, because the new ones will bring people to be baptized. In any case, during the four months of spreading the gospel, the teams should baptize about eighty new ones either through knocking on doors or through the contacts of newly baptized saints.</p>
<p>The eighty newly baptized believers should be under our step-by-step care for one hundred twenty days. We must first nourish them and then perfect, teach, and cultivate them. The work of nourishing is accomplished through the home meetings. We need to meet with people in their homes, not in large groups. Two people should coordinate together for a home meeting. Gradually, the new ones in a home meeting will be led into a small group meeting. The small group meetings are all-inclusive, having every aspect of the church life. Therefore, as a result of being in a small group, the new ones are brought into the reality of the church life. Finally, there is the prophesying in the church meetings.</p>
<p>The teams in the second wave should baptize eighty or ninety people during the first ten weeks. The six members on a team must labor on these eighty or ninety people. We must first do a nourishing work, and then we must perfect, teach, edify, and cultivate the new ones in the small groups. After being under our care for fifty days, the new ones should be stable and should remain. In the past even though we baptized thousands of people, not many remained, because we did not nourish, teach, perfect, or cultivate them. We are now doing things differently.</p>
<p>In nourishing and perfecting the new ones in the home meetings or the small group meetings, one household can be visited in the afternoon and another in the evening. This is a minimum of two households a day. During the last seven weeks, when the teams are not knocking on doors, they must spend all their time to nourish, teach, perfect, and cultivate the new ones in home meetings and small group meetings. During these seven weeks, the full-timers can form several teams, and each team can visit at least two households a day to care for two people. Regardless of whether the full-timers are nourishing or perfecting, they can care for two people a day and ten people in five days. If the teams practice this, more than half the people under their care will remain.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONTENTS OF NOURISHING<br />
IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We should nourish a person immediately after he is saved. This is not according to our former practice of baptizing someone and then immediately rushing off to baptize another person. From now on we must change our practice. Immediately after baptizing a person, we should remain in his home and feed him his first meal. Then we should visit him the day after his baptism and visit him again a few days later. By visiting a new one in this way, we should be able to meet with him at least ten times in the first month. All we should do is visit and feed the new ones. When we visit the new ones, we must feed them with the word of the Bible. We can do this with <em>Life Lessons.</em> However, we must use <em>Life Lessons</em> organically, not mechanically.</p>
<p>We must avoid being rigid and using formal methods. For example, at the beginning of a home meeting we always say, &ldquo;Today we are going to read <em>Life Lessons.</em>&rdquo; This is unnecessary. As soon as we enter a new one&rsquo;s home and sit down, we should exercise our spirit by praying or singing out loud so that our spirit rises up. We should even begin singing when we leave our home and pray while we are in the car. Then the meeting will begin before we even arrive at the new one&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>It is best to sing hymns while we are waiting at the door. Then when the new one hears us, his spirit will be stirred up, and the home meeting will begin spontaneously. After we enter the home, the new believer may say, &ldquo;I am so glad you came. I have a question to ask you.&rdquo; By this mutual asking and answering we may be led to a particular lesson in <em>Life Lessons</em> that is an appropriate response to the question. It is not necessary to read the entire lesson. It may be sufficient to read one point and the important verses. After half an hour the new one will be nourished. We should not leave as soon as the new one is nourished; instead, we should fellowship with him and talk to him. This is not a worship service; it is the best meeting.</p>
<p>Sometimes we will be able to answer a new one&rsquo;s questions simply by reading <em>Life Lessons</em> with him. Every lesson in <em>Life Lessons</em> has a hymn at the end that is appropriate to sing in coordination with our speaking. If we use the hymn, we will not be rigid and our method will not become a ritual. When we are spreading the gospel in the rural places, we must do things absolutely according to the new way. We are taking a new way; we are not doing a reforming work. Moreover, if we apply these methods mechanically, they will become old. We must instead be renewed daily and have a fresh spirit to supply others with Christ every day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIAN MEETINGS BEING PRAYING, SINGING,<br />
READING, AND SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In Christian meetings we pray, sing, read, and speak. These are the elements that compose our meetings. In addition, there is fellowship, petition, and mutual care. When we visit people in their homes, we must stir up their spirit, but in order to do this, our spirit must first be stirred up. In the past when we visited people, we did not understand the matters of exercising our spirit or releasing our spirit, because we had not received any leading related to this. Actually, <em>releasing the spirit, exercising the spirit,</em> and <em>using the spirit</em> are terms that we invented. When we were still in mainland China, Brother Nee emphasized and frequently used the phrase <em>use your spirit.</em> At that time we did not yet have the phrases <em>exercise your spirit</em> and <em>release your spirit.</em> We did not begin to use these until we were in Taiwan.</p>
<p>When we visited people in the past, we knew that we should dress neatly and take our Bible. We knocked on doors in a formal way, and when people answered the door, we were polite and formal. However, our formality became stiff and rigid, and as soon as things are rigid, they become dead. After we sat down and our host also sat down, we would look at one another, not knowing what to do or say. After a while we would select a hymn, and after singing the hymn, we prayed. This was a formal ritual. These were meetings according to the natural human concept of worship and service. It is difficult for a person&rsquo;s spirit to be moved in such a meeting.</p>
<p>However, when we researched the Bible, we saw a different situation. In Acts we saw that the saints sang hymns, praised, and rejoiced spontaneously. In chapter 4, when Peter and John were released from jail, they went to the brothers, who immediately rejoiced, praised, and prayed out loud. After praying, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness (vv. 23-31). What caused the disciples to speak with boldness? When Peter and John were in custody, the Jewish Sanhedrin charged them not to utter anything at all nor teach based upon the name of Jesus (vv. 17-18). But the more the Sanhedrin exhorted and charged, the more the apostles praised. After praising, they were filled with the Holy Spirit. This enabled them to speak even more boldly. In chapter 5 the apostles were arrested again and reminded of the charge &ldquo;not to teach based upon this name&rdquo; (v. 28). However, Peter and the apostles said, &ldquo;It is necessary to obey God rather than men&rdquo; (v. 29). This shows that the disciples were freed from formality.</p><h2 class="head1">ORGANIC PERFECTING<br />
IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We must remember these points when we go out to spread the gospel. We are wrong if we are merely using these methods to mechanically lead people to salvation. We should not do this. Our commission is to preach the gospel and bring people into the new way. The new way is the only way that has organic edification and building. As we have already fellowshipped, organic building requires organic preaching, organic nourishing, and organic perfecting. Preaching the gospel is organic, nourishing new ones in home meetings is also organic, and perfecting them in small group meetings is even more organic. The new way is entirely organic.</p>
<p>The small group meetings include teaching, edification, building, and perfecting. In the original Greek, the word <em>perfecting</em> in Ephesians 4:12 means &ldquo;equipping.&rdquo; When a person enters the military, he is trained, taught, made to practice, and thus he is equipped. However, <em>perfecting</em> has the meaning of both equipping and supplying. A soldier is not only equipped with the skills necessary to fight; he is also supplied with a gun and bullets. Then he can fight the battle. This is the meaning of perfecting, and this is achieved in the small group meetings.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the small group meetings emphasize fellowship, and this fellowship should not have regulations. On the other hand, the meetings emphasize prayer. We must pray immediately after we fellowship. Prayer brings in mutual concern and care. Therefore, there should not be many people in a small group meeting, and everyone must function. Suppose there are two hundred people in a church, and they attend only the big meetings. Even though they can greet one another, there is no way for them to know one another&rsquo;s situation. However, because there are no set forms or regulations in the small group meetings, everyone can function and speak. After fellowshipping about many things, we will have a burden to pray. We may pray for a sister who is sick or for a brother who lost his job. When everyone prays in one accord for five minutes, there will be a concern and care for one another. Fellowship brings in prayer, and prayer brings in mutual concern and care. This is what we should do in the small groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the small group meetings the brothers and sisters can ask questions. Some questions will be concerning our living, concerning life, and other questions will be related to the Bible, concerning the truth. For example, someone may read 1 Corinthians 11 and not understand what is written concerning cutting one&rsquo;s hair or shaving one&rsquo;s head and concerning long hair and head coverings. If he asks a question, everyone should corporately answer the question. Instead of only one person responding to the question, everyone should give a short answer. After everyone has answered, an older or more experienced person should give a concluding word. In this way there is mutual perfecting and edifying. In addition, during the mutual fellowshipping, praying, and caring, everyone functions.</p>
<p>The goal of the small groups is to perfect the saints to do the same things we do. If we have twenty people in our group, after five or six months of perfecting, many of them should be able to do what we do. Hence, after six months we can explain that everyone in the group is ready to &ldquo;graduate,&rdquo; and therefore we should split into groups of three to five people to form new small groups.</p>
<p>Some people may say that three to five people are too few to form a small group. This is true. Therefore, they must first preach the gospel by knocking on doors. After one week of knocking on doors, they may have three to five people who require their care. They should establish home meetings and then bring the new ones into small groups. Then the new ones will not only have the nourishing of the home meetings but also the perfecting of the small group meetings. The believers we gain are the first generation, and they will do what we do. After six months they can go out to gain the second generation; then in another six months, another generation will be produced. By this continuous reproduction there will be a constant spread and increase. If we are faithful to practice in this way, our numbers will double within one year. Our numbers may more than double, because it is especially easy to increase in the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF THE NEW WAY&mdash;PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 says, &ldquo;He...gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; According to these verses, after we are perfected by the gifted members, we become gifts. This can be compared to a university professor who teaches his students so that they can become teachers when they graduate. This is the goal of the new way, and this is what is revealed in the Bible. However, according to our past practice, we would baptize a person and then not care for him for several weeks. If we did care for him, the most we would do is encourage him to come to the Lord&rsquo;s Day meetings. Hence, people have listened to messages on the Lord&rsquo;s Day for ten to twenty years without experiencing much growth in life. While the saints may have experienced some growth in life, we did not perfect anyone.</p>
<p>The new way does not merely involve preaching the gospel, establishing home meetings, nourishing new ones, and starting small group meetings with mutual fellowship, prayer, and care. It also involves teaching the truth and pursuing the growth in life. The new way is all-inclusive. All the basic exercises and pursuits in the church life are in the small groups. Eventually, everyone in a small group &ldquo;graduates&rdquo; and is able to go out and start a small group meeting. They first preach the gospel and set up home meetings. Then they can set up a small group meeting in the same way that we do. As a result, the second generation, third generation, and the following generations will be the same as the first generation. In other words, one small group will become two small groups, and then it will become four, eight, and eventually twelve small groups. In this way the gospel will be thoroughly preached. Moreover, everyone will be able to preach the gospel, prophesy, and establish churches; that is, everyone will function as an apostle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LONG-TERM VIEW OF GOSPELIZING TAIPEI</h2>
<p>After Taiwan is gospelized, the full-time serving ones who graduate from the training will not need to go anywhere for the spread of the gospel; they will remain in Taipei. Presently, six full-time serving ones go to a town or village to establish a church, but when the full-time serving ones remain in Taipei, they will go to a district to establish a district meeting. If they practice in this way, the new ones they gain will do the same things that they do. We also look to the Lord for the perfecting of the five thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly in the church in Taipei so that they can go out in teams of six to spread the gospel in the communities and raise up district meetings. Among these five thousand saints, there are about one thousand elderly saints who need to pray much for the Lord&rsquo;s new way. Apart from the elderly saints, the young people who are under the age of eighteen are able to knock on doors, but they are not experienced. If we do not include these two categories of saints, there are about three thousand saints who can go out to knock on doors.</p>
<p>Most of these three thousand saints either work or are housewives; they are not full-time serving ones. Hence, these three thousand saints can function like one thousand saints. They can form one hundred sixty teams with six saints on a team. These teams can labor in a new district to start a district meeting. In this way six people can spend one year to establish a meeting with forty people. This is marvelous.</p>
<p>If we will be faithful to practice this, all of Taipei can be gospelized within one year. During the first six months we will labor to produce the first generation, and in the second six months we will produce the second generation. If we continue in this way, we will not merely gospelize Taipei, but we will spread to every corner of the city. There will be Christians everywhere, and we will hear people singing hymns and praising everywhere. There are many large apartment complexes in Taipei. Eighteen teams can labor in one apartment complex and sing hymns there. This will bring about a wonderful revival.</p>
<p>There are presently one hundred thirty full-time serving ones whom we will send out with our blessing. They have truly received mercy to be the pioneers to open new frontiers. I believe that these serving ones will establish a pattern for the church in Taipei to learn. The population of the city of Taipei is equivalent to two hundred towns with a population of ten thousand people each. Therefore, if we want to gospelize Taiwan, we must also gospelize Taipei. Even though we have set aside Taipei in order to send the full-time serving ones to the countryside, we must be clear that Taipei is still crucial.</p>
<p>The church in Taipei needs three hundred full-time serving ones in addition to the five thousand saints in the church. According to our fellowship, when we subtract the number of elderly saints and teenagers from the five thousand saints, there are three thousand saints who are equivalent to one thousand full-time serving ones. If we apply ourselves, we will succeed. Just as the six-member teams that went to the towns and villages have been successful, the work in Taipei will be successful with six-member teams. We need to testify concerning this in every meeting hall and encourage the saints to follow this pattern for spreading the gospel by going out in teams of six. If the saints will follow this pattern, we will have good results in Taipei.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING WITNESSES OF JESUS CHRIST</h1>
<h2 class="head1">WITNESSING THE CRUCIFIED AND<br />
RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2>
<p>According to the revelation in the book of Acts, everyone who is raised up and sent out by the Lord is a witness of the Lord. Acts 1:8 says, &ldquo;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&rdquo; Here the word <em>witnesses</em> is not related to our normal understanding of a witness who gives testimony in a legal case in a law court. In the New Testament the meaning of a witness is primarily to bear a living testimony of Jesus Christ in His crucifixion and resurrection. This is repeatedly emphasized in the book of Acts (v. 22; 2:32; 5:32; 26:16).</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITNESSING THAT CHRIST LIVES IN US</h2>
<p>How can we be the living witnesses of the Lord Jesus? Being a living witness does not merely involve saying that Jesus has resurrected. The fact that we are here is proof that He has resurrected. We are His living witnesses. If Jesus had not resurrected, we would not be able to live the way we do today. We would still be alive, but we would not live as we do today. When Peter stood and spoke for God, his expression, spirit, and fearless attitude demonstrated that the living Jesus was within him (2:14-36). When Peter was speaking, he was a living witness of the fact that the crucified and resurrected Jesus lived within him. If Jesus had not resurrected, He could not live within Peter.</p>
<p>Many Bible readers do not have this understanding of the word <em>witness;</em> even our understanding is not this deep. In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; This is the meaning of being a witness. A witness is a person who has Christ living in him. The chorus of a hymn says, &ldquo;He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today! /...You ask me how I know He lives? / He lives within my heart&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #503). His living in us proves that He has resurrected and that He is living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A LIVING IN DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The life that Jesus lived on earth was not a living in the natural life but a living that was in death and resurrection, a living that passed through the cross. His death involved many things. The death of Jesus was not merely during the few hours He spent on the cross; He was dying during the more than thirty years that He was on earth. In fact, He died daily. The living of Jesus on earth was a living that continually passed through death. This death delivered Him from everything that was outside of God.</p>
<p>Death is a great deliverance. When we die, we are delivered from every form of disturbance, entanglement, and pressure. As Christians, we are troubled by the world, sin, and Satan. Sin includes not only outward sinful acts but also the sinful nature within us. Within us, our natural man is composed of the self, the flesh, lusts, and our sinful nature. Hence, there are three outward items that trouble us and four inward items that bother us. One of these items, sin, exists outside of us and within us. These seven items bother us continually.</p>
<p>As witnesses, we must live a witnessing life. This is a life that lives out the living of Jesus in death and resurrection. The Lord&rsquo;s death delivers us from the world, sin, and Satan; it also delivers us from the self, the flesh, lusts, and indwelling sin.</p>
<p>The Bible refers to the spread of the gospel and also to the spread of the kingdom of God. The spread of the gospel is actually the spread of the Lord Jesus, but how does He spread? After the Lord Jesus was raised from the dead, His spread involved His delivering His seekers from the world, sin, Satan, and the self. The Lord Jesus did not live by the lust of the flesh, and He was delivered from the self. In the Gospel of John the Lord repeatedly said that He did not speak from Himself, nor did He do anything by Himself; He was not the source of anything that He did (6:38; 12:49; 14:10). This is to be delivered from the self. The Lord lived a life in death that had no relationship with the self. He did not have sin, the flesh, or lust. When we go out to spread the gospel, we should live this kind of living so that people can see that we have passed through death; in us the world has been judged, Satan has been destroyed, and our self, the flesh, lusts, and sin are also judged.</p>
<p>Someone asked about staying in the home of the new believers. We should all know that to stay in someone&rsquo;s home is not the same as merely staying in a physical house. There is absolutely no problem with a house, but there can be a problem with the people living in the house. Suppose a couple, their elderly mother, and four children live in a house. It will not be a simple matter for us to live with these seven people, because the world, sin, Satan, the self, the flesh, lusts, and the sinful nature are with us. These seven problems are also with every person in the house. We can imagine the situations that can arise when eight people live together under the same roof.</p>
<p>A newly baptized believer may rejoice over his baptism and want to receive us into his home. However, we should not think that his baptism has terminated these seven problems. We still have these seven problems. Some saints were baptized more than ten years ago and have participated in the church life for seven or eight years. They may even have served the Lord full time for several years, yet they are not completely freed from these seven problems. They are not clean; they still have germs. We are full of germs. When a surgeon operates on a patient, the entire operating room must be sterilized. Moreover, the doctor must wear a sterilized garment and gloves, and the patient must be cleaned. If the operating room and the people involved are not clean, the patient may catch some germs during the operation, and this may result in a more serious condition. Thus, if we stay in the same house with others, who have the same germs that we have, how can we expect not to have any problems?</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING A CRUCIFIED LIFE</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 1:5 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;You know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.&rdquo; This means that Paul lived a life in death and resurrection. He lived a life of witnessing the crucified and resurrected Christ. In fact, as Paul was living among the saints in Thessalonica, the crucified and resurrected Christ was living there. Paul was a witness of the Lord Jesus. He was constituted a witness through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Paul was crucified with the Lord Jesus (Gal. 2:20); he died together with Christ (Rom. 6:8). Hence, it was no longer Paul who lived; even though his name was still Paul, the person living was not Paul, because Paul was crucified with Christ.</p>
<p>From the human point of view, in the physical realm, the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus took place at the end of His thirty-three and a half years on earth. However, from God&rsquo;s point of view, in the spiritual realm, the Lord Jesus lived a crucified life from the day He was born; He lived a life under the shadow of the cross.</p>
<p>Even though the Gospel of Luke puts more emphasis on the human living of the Lord Jesus, it does not say whether the Lord cried when He was six months old. However, all babies cry because they cannot express themselves otherwise. When they are hungry, they cry, and when they are thirsty, they also cry. They cry when they are cold and when they are not feeling well. All mothers know this. The cries of a baby are related to the needs of the flesh. We have been living in the flesh since we were born. However, we believe that even when the Lord Jesus was a baby, He was bearing the cross. Throughout His life the Lord Jesus lived a selfless life, a life without &ldquo;I.&rdquo; This is death. He died every day until He was actually put to death on the cross. The cross was the sum total, the completion, of His death.</p>
<p>Throughout His life the Lord Jesus lived a crucified life. Without death there is no life; death causes life to multiply. When the Lord was living a crucified life on earth, God was living out from within Him. God lived out is resurrection. Resurrection did not merely occur after the Lord entered into death and came out of the grave. Resurrection was manifested in the crucified life He lived on earth. This life allowed God to live out from within Him. This is resurrection.</p>
<p>In John 11:25 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life.&rdquo; The Lord is life because He is resurrection. If He were not resurrection, He could not be life. In His human living the Lord died daily. Not one moment passed by without His being under the killing of the cross, and not one moment passed by without His living in resurrection. God was expressed in the Lord&rsquo;s living because the Lord died to His self. He lost His soul-life so that the living God could be expressed. This is resurrection, and this is the living of the Lord Jesus. Hence, when we go out as witnesses of Jesus, we should live this One. We should live like Him, dying daily and daily living out God.</p>
<p>Young people are more temperamental than older people and have more difficulty with the lust of the flesh, but older people can also have more problems than the younger ones. We can send out one hundred thirty young people to spread the work, but we dare not send out even three older people. Young people are more flexible and can adapt to their environment. If we send out older saints, within the first week they might return full of complaints. This does not mean that only the older saints are difficult; every one of us has problems. Little children are difficult, and young people are difficult. People in their thirties are difficult, middle-aged saints are difficult, and even the elderly saints are difficult. A person is a hard case regardless of whether he is young or old. If we see this, we will not be so quick to criticize others. What ground do we have to criticize others? We are not better! At best, we are &ldquo;a pot calling the kettle black.&rdquo; Thus, there is no need to fight with any saint or even with our own family, because we are all the same. This can be compared to the saying, &ldquo;In the whole world, all crows are black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In general, people between the ages of twenty and thirty-five tend to have fewer problems. It is easy for a person who is over fifty to become a problem to others. A church that is experienced in providing hospitality knows that it might receive criticism from guests who are close to the age of sixty. However, when the guests are young people in their twenties, they are more flexible; they do not care whether it is hot or cold, whether the window is open or closed, or whether they have a blanket. The young people do not care for any of these matters; neither do they criticize.</p>
<p>We should not judge one another and say that this sister has a strong disposition or that that brother is stubborn. Someone may be strong or stubborn, but we are often stronger and more stubborn. Others may be strong on the outside, but we are strong within, or they may be stubborn outwardly, but our stubbornness is within. Others are frank and express themselves without any guise, but we hide everything within. Our hardness can even resist a nuclear bomb. Therefore, we must all learn from Paul, who said, &ldquo;When I came to you, brothers,...I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:1-2).</p>
<p>Whether we are strong inwardly or outwardly, the cross is able to solve every problem. No matter how old a person is or where he goes, if he is on the cross, he will not be a problem to those who receive him, because the cross has solved the problem of his self. To a person on the cross, cold water is as good as hot water, and food that is overdone is as good as food that is not well cooked. Everything is all right to him. If we are guests and the blanket we are provided with is not warm enough, we can wear heavier clothes to bed. However, we should not let our host know; otherwise, he may give us his blanket, which will be a trouble to him. When we travel, we should take everything we need so that we do not cause our host any trouble. In summary, a person who has passed through the cross will not criticize or judge others; even if he must suffer a little, he will not speak, because a dead person has no feeling.</p>
<p>If we are such a crucified person, we will have no problems when we live with other people. Furthermore, we will give people a good impression, an excellent testimony; we will testify of the crucified and resurrected Christ. People will say that although we are only in our twenties, we live the life of a crucified Christian. This is what it means to be a witness, and this is a strong testimony. Hence, when we go out for the propagation, we must remember not to offend people while we preach the gospel. We can be eloquent when we preach the gospel. However, if we are not on the cross, after we stay in a new one&rsquo;s home for two weeks, he will see through us and will no longer receive us into his home. This would be a great failure.</p>
<p>We must have a living that is the living of Jesus Christ; we must be His witnesses. We are testifying of One who died and resurrected. He is in us today. He is repeating His life and His living within us. It is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us. If we are such people, we can stay in anyone&rsquo;s home, and there will never be problems. We will not cause any problems for our hosts. Whether their children cry or whether they rise early or late, we will not be bothered, and our sleep will not be affected. Whatever people do or say will not affect us because we are on the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>In 1934 I was invited to give a conference in Ping-Yang, Chekiang Province. At the time I was suffering from a serious ulcer, and all the saints knew this. One day the saints asked a brother to prepare steamed buns for me. When I saw the bright, shiny buns, I knew that they were not fully cooked. I was worried, because half-cooked buns are bad for people with ulcers. However, I could not refuse the buns, so I ate a few bites. I knew that if I ate a whole raw bun, I would not be able to give the message that night. The brother who prepared the buns kept asking me to eat and even removed the other food from my plate. If I became angry with him, I would have been unable to give the message that night. Hence, I turned in the depth of my being to experience the cross. But I still had to eat the buns, so I changed my way of eating and chewed the raw bun until it became very soft, and then I swallowed it. This example shows that things are not always convenient when we go out in the work. We must learn to live under the shadow of the cross.</p>
<p>When Brother Watchman Nee was about twenty years old, he was invited to speak in Hsuchow, Anhwei Province. His hosts prepared a Western-style bed that was made of wire netting, but they put only a sheet and a pillow on the netting without a mattress or blankets. Brother Nee slept the whole night on the wire-bed. He did not say anything to his host. He could not even sleep on the floor, because it was a mud floor. This is to bear the cross. When people found out about the bed, they said, &ldquo;This Mr. Nee preaches the gospel at a young age, and he is truly bearing the cross.&rdquo; Brother Nee could have requested bedding, but how would this have affected his testimony of a crucified living? We can request what is rightfully ours, but we will not have the experience of dying with Christ in His crucifixion.</p>
<p>When we go out for the propagation, we should all be witnesses of Christ. A witness of Christ is a person who daily lives under the shadow of the cross by being in death and resurrection. Stanza two of <em>Hymns,</em> #631 says, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d have Christ formed within me, / I must breathe my final breath, / Live within the Cross&rsquo;s shadow, / Put my soul-life e&rsquo;er to death.&rdquo; The chorus says, &ldquo;If no death, no life, / If no death, no life; / Life from death alone arises; / If no death, no life.&rdquo; When we go out to spread the gospel, we are spreading God&rsquo;s kingdom; that is, we are spreading Christ. To spread Christ means that Christ is lived out through us. When we daily live a crucified and resurrected life under the shadow of the cross, Christ can be lived out from us, and life can flow out from us.</p>
<p>Prayer: Lord, You are the One sending us out to bear fruit. We cannot bear fruit, but You can. It is only through Your death and resurrection that we can accomplish anything. O Lord, we look to You for the sake of the brothers and sisters who are going out. We ask that wherever they go and with whomever they coordinate, they would pass through death and resurrection; they would die daily and be in resurrection to enjoy You, experience You, live You out, and flow You out to others. This is the blessing we want for them. We are not asking for outward prosperity or for the success of the work. We want You to have a way to go forth from us. Lord, we bless them. We look to You and wait on You on their behalf. We pray that You will cause them to enjoy You bountifully as the crucified and resurrected Lord, as their life and their bountiful supply within, so that they will not have any lack or shortage, but rather they would experience Your riches every day.</p>
<p>Lord, we pray that when the outward environment is difficult, You will make their inward enjoyment sweeter. We know that the experience You give us and the coordination You arrange for us are for us to know You and Your resurrection power so that we would stay in the mold of Your death and be daily conformed to Your death. Lord, as You are leading us to go forth this time, we pray that You would cause us to receive grace and blessing and that You would also cause us to glorify You. Enable us to gain a profit, that is, to gain You as our everything. Lord, may this spread not only be the going forth of the gospel but even more the going forth of Yourself. We pray that You would go forth to fill the island of Taiwan, including every town and every village. When people see the gospel vans and the ambassadors of the gospel, may they think of You and smell Your fragrance. May their inward being long for You, be inclined toward You, and receive You.</p>
<p>Lord, bless Taiwan, and bless every village and every citizen in Taiwan through these brothers and sisters who are going out for the spread of the gospel. Cause Your name to be known to every family and every household in Taiwan so that they will receive You and be saved. Use the brothers and sisters to bring Your gospel to every home. Through their speaking, singing, praying, and calling on Your name in the homes, kindle the fire of the gospel in all the villages in Taiwan. May Your presence be with the brothers and sisters. Propagate Yourself, shame Your enemy, eliminate all the superstitions and heresies, shatter all the idols, and bind the evil one behind the idols. Lord, we declare Your lordship. Be King and reign over the island of Taiwan. May the truth and freedom reign. Lord, hear our prayer, execute our prayer, and pour out Your blessing. Amen.</p></body></html>
