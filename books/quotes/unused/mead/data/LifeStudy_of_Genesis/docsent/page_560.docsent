   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c Producing Kings, Rulers, and Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 10 says, "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The scepter here denotes the scepter of the kingship or of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 45:6 says, "The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The scepter, a symbol of the kingdom, refers to the kingly authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the scepter in verse 10 refers to Christ's kingdom, Christ's kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For the scepter never to depart from Judah means the kingship will never depart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hebrew poetry is written in pairs; hence, "the ruler's staff" in this verse is synonymous with "the sceptre."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Undoubtedly the ruler here is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Hebrew word for ruler in this verse means lawgiver.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the One who gives the law, for He has the staff and the scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the Ruler who has the authority, the staff and the scepter of the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse says that the ruler's staff will not depart from "between his feet."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The words "between his feet" are a poetic term denoting seed or posterity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, they refer to Judah's descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the tribe of Judah will always have kings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 1 Chronicles 5:2, Judah has the kingship, and rulers come out of his posterity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>d Having Shiloh</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This authority will continue until Shiloh comes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word Shiloh means "Peace bringer."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most good Bible teachers agree that Shiloh refers to Christ in His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Christ comes the second time, He will come as the Prince of peace, as the One who brings peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time, the whole earth will be filled with peace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 10 also says, "And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The peoples here are equivalent to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the second coming of Christ, all nations will submit to Him and obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 2:1 through 3 and 11:10 indicate that from the beginning of the millennium at the Lord's second coming, all nations will obey Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They will come to Him to receive God's instructions.</S>
