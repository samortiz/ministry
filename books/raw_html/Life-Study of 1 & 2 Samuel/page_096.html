<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In His Victory over the Jebusites</H2><P>A number of matters in 2 Samuel 5:6-25 are evidence that God had established David and had exalted his kingdom. The first of these is recorded in verses 6 through 8, where we see that David was established by God in his victory over the Jebusites.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In the Building of Zion<br>as His Stronghold and of Jerusalem<br>and in His Becoming Greater and Greater</H2><P>David's being established by God is seen also in the building of Zion as his stronghold and of Jerusalem (v. 9). Furthermore, "David became greater and greater; and Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him" (v. 10). This indicates that David had God's presence. In serving the Lord, we need to have the assurance that we have His presence. If we are really following the Lord for the fulfillment of His economy, we will certainly have His presence. If in any matter we do not have the inner sense that the Lord is with us, we must be careful and consider our way. Saul first lost the presence of God (1 Sam. 16:14). That should have helped him to reconsider his way, but he did not. In the Lord's recovery, whenever we do anything, we must take care of the sense of the Lord's presence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Hiram King of Tyre Supplying Him<br>Materials for the Building of a Palace for Him</H2><P>Hiram king of Tyre sent David materials and workmen for the building of a palace for him (2 Sam. 5:11-12). This was a further strong evidence that David's being established as king over Israel was really of God. Such an assurance is very important and is necessary in our working for the Lord. We all need to learn the lesson of caring for these two things: the inward presence of God and the outward confirmation in our environment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Begetting More Children,<br>Including Solomon, in Jerusalem</H2><P>According to verses 13 through 16, in Jerusalem David begot more children, including Solomon.</P>
