   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 22 Date:July 23, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER T. G.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After I was saved, I studied the Bible but did not understand very much.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later I read 1 Peter 4, and I was touched by it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was quite seeking in the local church and often experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes I would jump, weep, or laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I often went out with brothers to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1940 the Japanese bombed us, and three bombs fell into my house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My wife was killed, but the Lord comforted me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1942 the Japanese bombed us for the second time, and my home was destroyed again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was in debt and began to work as a water carrier to repay my debt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1943 there were harvest proceeds derived from ancestral lands, but I could not collect them because the lands were in my son's name, and he had been adopted by someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Later I became sick, and my life was in danger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On top of that I was criticized and misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For four months I was short of food and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later I moved to Tai-Shun, Chekiang.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cost of living was much lower there, and I lived for a year in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT God's Ways and God's Acts</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our brother has received the Lord's supply through His guidance and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we have to know that the Christian pathway consists of two things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First, there are God's acts, such as God leading His children through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, there are God's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what one sees behind God's acts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way of God is the pathway of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God has His way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's thought, method, and will reflect His way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Israelites only knew God's acts, but Moses knew His ways Psa 103:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, God guided the people of Israel by means of wonders and miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These were God's acts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the same time, Moses knew God's ways, that is, God's method of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, we have acts, which are outward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second, we have ways, which are inward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has certain ways of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can say with utmost respect that God has His "temperament."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In their exodus and through the ten plagues, the supply of manna, the living water in the wilderness, and all the other things, the people of Israel saw God's acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet Moses knew God's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every time God moved His finger, Moses knew what He was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One's inner understanding has to be enlightened before he can know God's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our brother needs to know not only God's acts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He needs to pray to have his inner understanding enlightened to know His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people can relate God's outward acts to others; but they do not know God's inward ways.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's acts are mainly for delivering us out of tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During the war many brothers and sisters experienced deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can only say that they experienced God's acts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But many have not seen God's ways.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the four Gospels men saw the wonders and miracles, but they did not see the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a man only sees the outward blessings without having adequate inner light or knowledge of the inner way, he cannot help others to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Jews witnessed many miracles of the Lord, but few knew the inward things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is also a big problem in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not enough just to have outward blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to ask God to enlighten our inner understanding to know His ways.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way we will make progress ourselves, and we will lead others on.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must be enlightened within before we can take the straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May the Lord grant us to know His acts on the one hand and His ways on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These are two aspects of the Christian pathway.</S>
