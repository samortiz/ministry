<h2 class="head2">Needing to Be an Overcomer</h2>
<h2 class="head3">God Calling the Overcomers</h2>
<p>The final seven epistles from the Lord to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3 speak very clearly regarding the desolation of the church. At the end of each of the seven epistles, the Lord calls His believers to be overcomers in the desolation of the church; this call is also a command. Different grounds, doctrines, and ways are worthless, because having the proper ground, doctrine, or way does not make a person an overcomer. In order to be an overcomer, one must be an overcoming person.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that since God&rsquo;s people came into existence, there has been a group of people called the overcomers. In principle, whenever the majority of God&rsquo;s people failed and were in desolation, a minority stood in the proper position, representing all of God&rsquo;s people in carrying out His ministry. These ones are called overcomers.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the first time the overcomers are clearly seen among God&rsquo;s people is at Mount Sinai, when the Levites preserved God&rsquo;s testimony by standing on His side against idol worship. God&rsquo;s original intention was that all His people, Israel, would be priests to serve Him (Exo. 19:6), but at Mount Sinai most of them fell into desolation by worshipping the golden calf (32:1-8). The Levites rose up to maintain the testimony of God on behalf of all the Israelites. They took the position that all the Israelites should have taken. Therefore, God gave the priesthood exclusively to the Levites. From then on the Levites were the overcomers among God&rsquo;s people (vv. 25-29); they were responsible for the Ark, which was in their midst. When the children of Israel moved in the wilderness, the Levites carried the Ark (Deut. 10:8). When they stopped, the Levites surrounded the Ark (Num. 1:50, 53). God&rsquo;s testimony was upon them and among them.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel crossed the Jordan River, the Levites were the first to step into the water, and they stood in the river until all the Israelites crossed over safely on dry ground (Josh. 3:14-17). Thus, there was a small group of overcomers among the Israelites who maintained God&rsquo;s testimony. When they entered Canaan, all the Israelites should have fought for the kingdom of God, but they lost their position as warriors. A very small group of people, particularly Gideon and his three hundred mighty men (Judg. 7:7), fought for God in place of all the Israelites. When Israel lost its standing, these three hundred stood as overcomers. Later, Samuel and David were overcomers. Before the captivity Elijah, Elisha, and Isaiah were overcomers; Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were overcomers during the captivity; and Ezra and Nehemiah were overcomers after the captivity. These men were clearly overcomers during the desolation of Israel. Some bore God&rsquo;s testimony while suffering persecution. Others maintained and recovered God&rsquo;s testimony in the face of Gentile idols after the captivity to Gentile lands.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the entire church was up to God&rsquo;s standard on the day of Pentecost, standing in the proper position and maintaining the testimony of God. Regrettably, this condition did not last long, and soon the church became degraded and desolate. However, Paul and Timothy were overcomers in the desolation. Paul says in 2 Timothy 1:15, &ldquo;All who are in Asia turned away from me.&rdquo; Demas, Paul&rsquo;s co-worker, loved the world and left Paul (4:10). Although Paul saw the desolation of the church, he still spoke for the Lord; even when he was imprisoned, in chains, and in danger for his life, he was not afraid or upset. He was an overcomer who stood in the proper position of the church to maintain the testimony of God.</p>
<p>When John wrote the seven epistles in Revelation, the church for the most part had fallen into desolation. At this time the Lord began to call out overcomers. The overcomers stand in the position in which most of the believers should be standing in but have lost. The entire church should be standing as a testimony, fighting for God; however, it is not, and most members of the church have fallen. The desolation of the church has continued and progressed over the past two thousand years. Nevertheless, in every age there is a small number of people who answer God&rsquo;s call and stand in the proper position of the church to maintain the testimony of God and fight for His kingdom. This group of people is the overcomers.</p>
<p>Thus, in the seven epistles in Revelation the Lord&rsquo;s call to the overcomers is a very important teaching. The Lord&rsquo;s final commandment is that the believers be overcomers. The overcomers are the man-child brought forth by the woman in Revelation 12:5. The woman signifies all of God&rsquo;s people; she is the aggregate of all those whom God has saved through the ages. The man-child signifies the few who are strong in the church, the overcomers. Revelation 12:11 says, &ldquo;They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.&rdquo; The overcoming believers in this verse are the man-child brought forth by the woman, and they are also the overcomers spoken of in the seven epistles in chapters 2 and 3. In chapters 17 and 18 they follow the Lamb to fight; in chapter 20 they follow the Lord to reign with Him (vv. 4, 6). The overcomers are the saints who take the place of the defeated believers to fulfill God&rsquo;s intention in the church.</p>
<p>During the desolation of the church, the Lord&rsquo;s only desire is that we would be overcomers. The Lord does not want us merely to preach the truth or stand on the proper ground of the church; He wants us to overcome. If we do not overcome, there is a problem with the truth we hold, the way in which we walk, and the ground upon which we stand. It is not enough to hold to orthodox truths and walk in the way of the church; we must also be overcomers.</p>
<p>The five requirements the Lord has given, including dealing with the conscience, discerning the nature of people, matters, and works, dealing with our motives and discerning the motives of others, living in the fellowship of life no matter whom we contact or are related to, and paying attention to the anointing, are related to being an overcomer.</p>
