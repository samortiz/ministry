   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Foolish Wanting to Borrow Oil</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>from the Prudent</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 8 says, And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This word implies that even after resurrection the foolish believers will still need the fullness of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Going out proves that the lamps of the foolish virgins are lighted, having oil in them, but not having an adequate supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The foolish virgins represent the believers who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God dwelling in them, but who are not filled with the Spirit of God so that He may saturate their whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Answer of the Prudent</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 9 says, But the prudent answered, saying, Lest there be not enough for us and for you, go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that no one can have the fullness of the Holy Spirit for others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may borrow many things, but we cannot borrow the infilling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is like eating.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one can eat for you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The prudent virgins told the foolish ones to go to those who sell and buy for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who sell oil must be the two witnesses during the great tribulation, the two olive trees and the two sons of oil Rev 11:3-4; Zech 4:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During the great tribulation, the two sons of oil, Moses and Elijah, will come to help God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To buy indicates the need of paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fullness of the Holy Spirit is obtained at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with the self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not pay this price today, we must pay it after resurrection, Those who do not pay the price do not have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, the foolish virgins will realize that they need to love the Lord with all their heart and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They will see that they need to give up the world and deal with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bridegroom Coming</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and the Ready Ones Going In</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>with Him to the Marriage Feast</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 10 says, And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word came refers to the Lord s coming to the air 1 Thes 4:16 , a part of His parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who are ready must be those who are invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb Rev 19:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be ready 24:44 by always having oil in our vessel, always being filled with the Spirit of God in our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To watch and be ready should be our daily exercise for the Lord s parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To go in with Him refers to the rapture of the resurrected believers to the air 1 Thes 4:17 during the Lord s parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The marriage feast in verse 10 is the marriage dinner of the Lamb Rev 19:9 , which will be held in the air 1 Thes 4:17 during the Lord s coming, His parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It will occur before the manifestation of the kingdom as a reward of mutual enjoyment with the Lord to the believers who are ready, who have been equipped with the fullness of the Holy Spirit before they die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After those who are ready go in with the Bridegroom to the marriage feast, the door is shut.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not the door of salvation, but the door to enter into the enjoyment of the Lord s marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Foolish Virgins Coming Later,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>but the Bridegroom Not Knowing Them</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 11 and 12 say, And later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I do not know you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The later coming of the foolish virgins refers to the later rapture of the resurrected believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They paid the price for the extra portion of oil, but they obtained it too late.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Time means a great deal here, for when they came, the door was shut.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they asked the Lord to open to them, He said, I do not know you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To not know here indicates not to recognize, not to approve, as in Luke 13:25; John 1:26, 31; 8:19.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The foolish virgins had their lamps lighted, went forth to meet the Lord, died, and were resurrected and raptured, but were late in paying the price for the fullness of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because of this, the Lord would not recognize or approve of them for participation in His marriage feast.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They missed this reward dispensationally, but they do not lose their salvation eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In telling them that He did not know them, the Lord was saying, I do not appreciate you or recognize you, and I do not approve of the way you lived on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Also, I do not approve of your coming so late.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, they are rejected from the enjoyment of the kingdom feast.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>13.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Watching</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 13 concludes, Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Chapter 24:40-44 refers to the rapture only of the living believers who are ready.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Chapter 25:1-13 is needed to cover the rapture of the dead and resurrected ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we read this portion of the Word, we see how watchful we need to be.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To be watchful and ready is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No other book warns us as often as the book of Matthew does.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I can testify before the Lord that for more than forty years I have been warned by this book.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever I have been a little careless, I have remembered the warnings contained in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yes, we all are virgins, but are we foolish or prudent?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all need to answer this question for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whether we are prudent or not depends on whether or not we have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit in our vessel.</S>
