   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Thummim Being an Object Engraved</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Remaining Four Letters</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Added to the Breastplate</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because there were four letters missing from the breastplate, another object the Thummim was added.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word Thummim means perfecters, or completers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without this object, the Hebrew alphabet on the breastplate of the high priest would have been short of four letters and would not have been complete.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Thummim was added, four letters were added, and thus the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet were present.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Urim Being an Illuminator</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Inserted into the Breastplate</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, there was the need to add another object the Urim.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Urim means lights, or illuminators.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The High Priest Going into</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>the Presence of God with the Breastplate</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>to Read God s Instructions and Make Decisions</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>according to the Shining of the Engraved Letters</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every time the high priest went into the presence of God, there were two kinds of plates on him: one was the shoulder plates, representing strength, for bearing God s people, and the other was the breastplate, which implies caring in love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord cares for us by holding us in His bosom and supplies us with power by bearing us on His shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today the elders should also hold the saints in their bosom and bear them on their shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The bosom s holding is an expression of love, and the shoulders bearing is a supply of power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every time the elders draw near to God, they need to wear these two kinds of plates; that is, they need to bear the saints upon themselves as they come into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The elders receiving of God s revelation reflects the receiving of revelation through the letters on the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many years ago I read an article concerning the Urim and the Thummim written by a Hebrew scholar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The author of this article said that in Joshua 7 Achan s sin was probably discovered through the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He stated that when the high priest came to seek God, he was able to put words and sentences together through the illumination of the letters on the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, through the Urim and the Thummim the high priest discovered that the one who sinned belonged to the tribe of Judah; then he identified the household and finally the person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The principle related to the use of the Urim and the Thummim is that the elders administration of the church is not through human government.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, it is a divine government, a theocracy, not a democracy or an autocracy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The elders must submit to God s authority and seek God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How does God lead the elders?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, He speaks through the Bible; second, through the Holy Spirit; and third, through the saints as an alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the elders come before God, they must bear the brothers and sisters on their shoulders and hold them in their bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As they bear the saints in God s presence, God enlightens and enables them to read the condition of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The longer the elders stay before God, the more they will understand God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is an excellent type in the Old Testament, and when it is realized in the New Testament, it preserves the principle of God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Serving as New Testament Priests</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>in Caring for the Brothers and Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>by Bringing Them into the Presence of God</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>in Order to Read Their Condition</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>and Seek God s Instruction</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are three means by which the elders administrate the church: the Bible, the Holy Spirit, and the saints as an alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our experience confirms these points.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the elders take care of God s children, they need to seek God s guidance; they need not only the Bible and the Holy Spirit but also the brothers and sisters as the alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that they need to bear the brothers and sisters before God and read the condition of every brother and sister before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way the elders will know what God wants them to do and what God s present will is in the church life.</S>
