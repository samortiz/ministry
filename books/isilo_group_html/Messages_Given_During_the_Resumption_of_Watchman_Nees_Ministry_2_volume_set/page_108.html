From that time on, God began to have distinct recoveries on the earth. This, of course, does not mean that the recovery began with Luther alone. At the same time that he was raised up, other people saw the same things that he did. He is merely taken as a representative of the recovery in that age. Before his time, the truth had become a kind of tradition, the apostolic ministry had become a system of popery, the oneness of the church had become an ecclesiastical ecumenism, and spiritual authority had become political authority. The church was taken captive to Babylon. The prevailing thought at that time was that the church ruled over the world; it declared that the whole world belonged to God. As a result, the Catholic church brought unconverted people into the church. As long as a person was a Roman citizen, he was automatically a member of the church. Spontaneously, infant baptism came in at that time. Originally, Christians were people who took the voluntary way of poverty. Christians and poor people are always linked together. But when the church opened its door to the world, voluntary poverty was lost, and the church became rich. Under normal circumstances, there should be two kinds of poor people in the church. One kind is the naturally poor ones, and the other kind is the voluntarily poor ones. Today in the church, we have the first kind of poor people. But there is no second kind of poor people. On the contrary, there are rich people in the church, and the church is filled with affluence. However, although many people are rich in material goods, they are poor in faith, and the inward spiritual content among them becomes more and more depleted.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF VOLUNTARY POVERTY</H2><P>Since the time of Clement, the truth became less and less clear. On the one hand, men became more and more capable of analysis and expositions, but at the same time they lacked life and did not have much grace or righteousness. Even at the time of Augustine, the truth was still unclear. Historically speaking, the church was always on the decline. Eventually it fell to such a low degree that reactions rose up within the Catholic church. One of these reacting ones was Francis of Assisi. He was dissatisfied with the outward riches of the church. He himself was originally a rich man, or at least the son of a rich man. Within a few days, he sold everything and gave to the poor. He himself began to practice a life of voluntary poverty. However, the things he wrote are unreadable. You may tolerate a line or two of his writings, but by the third line they become intolerable. Although we cannot tolerate his writings, the practice of voluntary poverty is nevertheless a right one.</P><P>In the church, those who receive little should not be in want, and those who receive much should not have an excess (2 Cor. 8:12). It is not a sin to receive much, but it is a sin to receive much and to have excess. If a man knows the Lord, he will invest everything in the Lord. If a man says that he loves the Lord, yet will not invest in the Lord, his love is false. The Lord says that the poor we always have with us (John 12:8). He did not say that we always have the poor brothers with us in the church. Rather, He says that the poor we always have with us. Among the brothers and sisters, it is not difficult to be without want. As long as those who have excess would give away, poor brothers will not appear among us. The Lord's principle is not to keep, but to give. If we all give, there will not be unnecessary riches in the church. It is abnormal that some people are too rich in the church. All excess riches have to be given away. In the world, people would throw away their lives in exchange for money. But in the Bible, God wants our lives instead of money. We cannot be a Christian in an uncertain way. Our God is not uncertain; He is very specific. He wants not only our money, but our lives also.</P><P>Later, in Moravia God raised up Count Zinzendorf of Saxony. He was originally an aristocrat and a man of learning. For the Lord's sake, he set aside his estate to receive all kinds of believers. Through his work, the Moravians were raised up. Out of this group, many people were sent to foreign lands. The number of those sent out from them exceeds that sent from any other group and ranks highest in terms of percentage. After this, there was Sister Eva, who was a German. She also took the way of voluntary poverty.</P><P>In the last century, the Brethren were raised up. They were very strong in the truth. Although they did not like to talk very much about themselves, a few dozen of their leaders also sold all their possessions at one time to follow the Lord. For a Christian, the question of money must be settled once for all. If it is not settled, the Lord cannot have a way to go on. What is the meaning of degradation in the church? It means that the principle of economy has come into the church. Once the principle of economy comes in, everything will be reckoned according to value, and the Lord will have no way to go on.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_107.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_109.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 108</div><br></body></html>
