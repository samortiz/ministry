<p>All saved ones can testify that God&rsquo;s presence is in the meetings of the church. Of course, we also have God&rsquo;s presence when we pray and when we read the Bible. However, we know that those experiences cannot equal the presence of God that we experience in the meetings of the church. When we pray, we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. However, when the church gathers together to pray, we experience the glory of Jehovah filling the tabernacle. Sometimes we do not remember the message we heard in a meeting, but we know that we touched the presence of God, and thus the glory of Jehovah filled our midst.</p>
<p>After a meeting we often sense that the world has no power over us and that sin has lost its ground in us. Moreover, we are able to live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Then after two or three days, we gather again for another meeting, and again we see something glorious and touch something real. This kind of experience does not happen only in the large meetings. We often have such experiences. When the condition of the church is normal, the church is full of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Then even if there are no meetings, we can still sense that the saints have been built up to be the glorious house of God. The church has an atmosphere that causes people to sense that God is present.</p>
<p>Hence, if someone is seeking God, we should be bold to say, &ldquo;Go to the meetings of the church!&rdquo; When Christians meet together in the Lord&rsquo;s name, the people who go into their midst meet God. This happens not only in the large meetings. Even when three or five saints gather together to speak for God, people sense that God is in their midst. This is a wonderful condition, because the glory of Jehovah fills our midst.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Raising Up of the Tabernacle</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Standing of the Boards</h2>
<p>In Exodus the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle after the tabernacle was raised up. The erecting of the tabernacle depended upon one crucial matter&mdash;the standing of the boards. The tabernacle had a total of forty-eight boards: twenty boards on the south, twenty boards on the north, six boards on the west, and two boards for the corners in the rear (26:18, 20, 22-23). Each board was ten cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width (vv. 15-16). The forty-eight boards had to stand and also be united.</p>
<p>The boards were able to stand firm because each board had two tenons, and under each tenon was a socket, which was made of a talent of silver (vv. 17, 19, 21, 24-25; 38:27). Under the two tenons of each board there were two sockets, and each socket had a hole to contain a tenon. In this way the boards were able to stand firm. The silver sockets are very meaningful. Silver signifies the work of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and the sockets signify stability for standing. We can stand firm before God because of Christ&rsquo;s redemption. The redemption of Christ is our foundation. It is the solid base for our standing in God&rsquo;s dwelling place. We are standing firmly on the foundation of Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Uniting of the Boards</h2>
<p>Not only were the boards standing; they were also united. The tabernacle was erected by means of the standing and uniting of the boards. Once the tabernacle was erected, it became God&rsquo;s house. A house cannot be called a house until it is built. Piles of wood and stone are merely materials; they are not yet a house. Only when the materials are standing and joined will they become a house. The glory of God filled the tabernacle because the tabernacle was built up. This shows that God&rsquo;s glory will be in the midst of God&rsquo;s children when they are built up. The building does not involve individuals but all God&rsquo;s children. They are joined together not by human organization but by God. God&rsquo;s life and nature join God&rsquo;s children together.</p>
<p>Every board was one and a half cubits in width. This is very meaningful. The numbers three and five are basic numbers related to God&rsquo;s building. Genesis 6 contains the record of the building of the ark by Noah. The ark was three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high (v. 15). The basic numbers of these dimensions are three and five. The dimensions of the tabernacle are also composed of these basic numbers. For instance, there were ten curtains divided into two sets of five (Exo. 26:1, 3), and the depth of the tabernacle was thirty cubits. Both the curtains and the depth of the tabernacle contain the basic numbers of three and five. Concerning the standing boards, the length of each board was ten cubits. Ten is a multiple of five. For example, the ten virgins consisted of five who were foolish and five who were prudent (Matt. 25:1-2). Hence, ten cubits is made up of two sets of five. Each board was one and a half cubits wide, which is half of three. This means that a board is not a complete unit. This is similar to a couple. Neither a husband nor a wife is a complete unit; they are halves. Only when the husband and the wife are joined together can they be a complete unit.</p>
<p>We need to see that as boards, none of us is complete. You are one and a half cubits, and I am one and a half cubits. We need to be matched with another to make a complete unit. The number of the boards in the tabernacle was not an odd number but an even number: twenty boards on the south, twenty on the north, six in the rear, and two extra boards for the corners. All the boards were coupled; they were matched with others. It is wonderful that three and five are the basic numbers in God&rsquo;s building. This indicates that we are not complete units. We are one and a half cubits. We are only half a unit. We need a brother or a sister to match us. In the tabernacle no one can stand alone; all are in twos. There were not twenty-one boards nor were there nineteen boards. There were twenty boards, six boards, and two boards. All the boards were in pairs. This means that we cannot stand alone. We need to be matched with another board.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ Making His Home in Our Heart and the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 41</div><br></body></html>
