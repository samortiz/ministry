   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 7:39 says, "But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the time the Lord Jesus was speaking these words, "the Spirit was not yet"; this means that the Spirit was not there yet because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, I was greatly troubled by this word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I simply could not understand how the Spirit could not have been there when Jesus was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many years later I read Andrew Murray's book, The Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter five of this book is entitled "The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That chapter shocked me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through that chapter my eyes were opened to see why the Spirit was not yet there when the Lord Jesus was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before the Lord's crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God consisted only of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, after the Lord's resurrection, many items were compounded into the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, after the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God was composed not only of divinity, but of many other crucial items as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the time of John chapter seven the Spirit of God was there, possessing merely divinity, but the all-inclusive Spirit, including all the other items, was not there yet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SPIRIT OF GOD BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit of God was there from the very beginning Gen 1:1-2 , but the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , was not yet at the time the Lord spoke the word recorded in John 7, because He was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After His resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day He was resurrected John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit is now another Comforter, who is the Spirit of reality promised by Christ before His death John 14:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, He had both the divine and human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, He is now the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ as the living water for us to receive John 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although I was enlightened through the reading of Andrew Murray's book, I was not able to give others a thorough definition of the all-inclusive Spirit until Exodus 30 was opened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this chapter we have the matter of the compound ointment Exo 30:22-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In typology we have a type of the Spirit of God in the Old Testament, and this type is the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you read the Old Testament carefully, you will see that several times olive oil is used to indicate the Spirit of God Psa 45:7; Isa 61:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Exodus 30, four spices are compounded into a hin of olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, in Exodus 30 we do not see simply the olive oil, but a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A hin of olive oil is the basic element of this compound, and four spices are added to it: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When these spices are added to the oil, the oil becomes an ointment, a compound of five elements, the oil plus the four spices.</S>
