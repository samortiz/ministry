   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Ministering Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for the Edification of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and for the Building Up of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostles teaching does mainly one thing it ministers Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we need any exhortation, that exhortation must be related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, Christ, the Person Himself, should be our exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even our admonishing should be Christ, the living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever we say, whether it be a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, an exhortation, or an admonition, in essence and in totality must be the ministry that ministers Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ must be the center, the centrality and universality, the element, the essence, the substance, and altogether every part of what we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We exhort others because we want to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may realize that there are certain aspects in the saints family life or daily living that are void of Christ and short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, we may exhort the saints, not just with some ethical or moral teaching but with Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may point out to the saints that they are short of Christ in a particular area and fellowship with them so that they can mend their situation with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the proper exhortation and admonition, and this kind of ministering of Christ is for the edification of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word edification in the Bible includes ethical and moral instruction and building up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mainly, to edify is to build.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of the Chinese understand the word edification strictly in an ethical and moral sense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the goal of whatever we minister of Christ to the saints is not only to give them some ethical and moral instruction but also to build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our speaking according to the teaching of the apostles is ultimately for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever we speak in the meetings a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, an exhortation, or an admonition should be for the goal of building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>NOT TEACHING THINGS DIFFERENT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>FROM THE APOSTLES TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul tells us in 1 Timothy 1:3-4 that we are not to teach things different from the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The different things listed by Paul are in three categories: myths, unending genealogies, and the law 1 Tim 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law is the basic and fundamental teaching and thought of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In nature and in function, the law is good Rom 7:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To teach the Old Testament in the way of teaching the law, essentially speaking, is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But dispensationally speaking, it is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law belongs to the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It has nothing to do with the New Testament dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the Apostle Paul did not allow for the teaching of the law even though it was according to the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The law is scriptural essentially but not dispensationally.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Genealogies are extensions of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some Jewish scholars, in their overstudy of the Old Testament, liked to dig out things contained in the genealogies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of genealogical study can create many debates.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A teaching concerning genealogies is not as basic or fundamental as the teaching of the law and it is an extended understanding of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Myths are even further extensions of the Old Testament and refer to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, true or false stories, and fictions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They might include Jewish stories of miracles, rabbinical fabrications, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may not teach the law or the genealogies of the Old Testament, nor would we fabricate stories as myths.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we still can teach things that are different from the apostles teaching today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The keeping of the Sabbath as taught by the Seventh Day Adventists is a different teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They say that the believers in the New Testament age should still keep the law, and one of the commandments of the law is to keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They claim that if we do not keep the Sabbath, which is on Saturday, we break the law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Surely the Sabbath is mentioned in the Bible but this is not the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The apostles teaching tells us that the feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are shadows, but the reality, the body, of these shadows is Christ Col 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ today is our Sabbath Matt 11:28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus took the lead to purposely break the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On two consecutive Sabbath days He purposely broke the Sabbatical regulation, offending the Pharisees to the uttermost Luke 6:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He declared to the Pharisees that He was the Lord of the Sabbath v. 5 . He was the One who set up the regulation of the Sabbath, and He was also the One to cancel it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As the Lord of the Sabbath, He had the authority and the right, the full position, to establish the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He also had the full right in the Gospels to discard the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When He said to keep the Sabbath, the Sabbath should be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now that He has discarded the Sabbatical regulation, why should we keep it?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus took the lead to break the Sabbath because the Sabbath was a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The reality of a person s shadow is the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ is the reality of the shadow of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before He came, there was the need of the Sabbath day to typify Him, to foreshadow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now that He is here, the shadow is not necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I may send you a picture of me before I come to visit you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I arrive, would you still pay all your attention to the picture and forget about me?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That would be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now that Christ Himself is here, we can discard the picture, the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now we have a new day called the Lord s Day, the day of the Lord, in the New Testament Rev 1:10; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This shows us that a teaching may be seemingly according to the Scriptures, and yet be altogether not a part of the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Certainly what we teach that is natural according to our culture or tradition is not according to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not teach Chinese, British, French, German, American, Japanese, or Korean things in our church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But even if we teach something in the Old Testament dispensation, this teaching is not according to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We cannot teach things that belong to the old dispensation set up by God because we are now in the new dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What we teach in our Christian meetings according to the God-ordained way should be absolutely within the limit of the apostles teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>FOCUSING ON THE ECONOMY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What we speak in the church meetings should focus on the economy of God 1 Tim 1:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This economy is altogether concerning two items: Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2b and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The focus and the crucial center of whatever we speak must be Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have to fully learn the truth concerning Christ and the church so that our meetings will never get outside the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our speaking in the meetings should always be focused on Christ as the definition, the explanation, and the fullness of the very God and the church as the definition, the explanation, and the fullness of the very Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God is embodied in Christ and Christ is fully expressed in the church this should be our central vision in all of our teaching and has to be the focus, the very crucial center, of all our speaking.</S>
