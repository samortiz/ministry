<h1 class="title">REWARD AND GRACE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 4:4-5; 6:23a</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Wages are justly received
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Wages are earned through working.</li>
	<li>Wages are a payment according to righteousness, according to the work a person renders.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Grace is freely received
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Grace does not require working.</li>
	<li>Grace is freely bestowed, and not earned.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s sin earns him the wages of condemnation and death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the eyes of God, all of man&rsquo;s behavior is sin, and this behavior is man&rsquo;s work. Man does no other work but to sin. Therefore, before God we have done only the work of sin.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s work of sin earns the wages of death. Thus, the Bible says, &ldquo;The wages of sin is death.&rdquo;</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s grace is freely bestowed through the righteousness of Christ
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through the righteousness of Christ, grace came to us. The redemption of Christ has already fulfilled the righteous requirement of God, thus enabling God to bestow grace upon us.</li>
	<li>Grace is bestowed upon us through the redemption of Christ. This is possible because His redemption reckons us righteous.</li>
	</ol></li>
