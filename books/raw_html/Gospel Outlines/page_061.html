<h1 class="title">THE FOUNTAIN OF CLEANSING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Zech. 13:1</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man&rsquo;s sins
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>From the time of Adam&rsquo;s fall until now, the human race has been in sins and evildoings.</li>
	<li>Point out the fact that man is born in iniquity. Give examples to prove that man is born in sin. There is no need to teach a person to commit sin, because sin grows out of man&rsquo;s corrupt nature.</li>
	<li>Also point out in a solid way the fact that man commits sins. Bring out a few things to prove the point, such as lying, stealing, covetousness, and craftiness.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s righteousness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s righteousness causes Him to judge the sin of man.</li>
	<li>According to God&rsquo;s righteousness, all men are under God&rsquo;s condemnation, and all should perish in the lake of fire.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s love
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s righteousness causes Him to condemn men, but God&rsquo;s love causes Him to come to save men.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s love prepares the way of salvation for men. Expound these two points.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s saving way
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is both righteous and loving. These two aspects caused God to accomplish a saving way for us. This saving way not only fulfills the purpose of His love, but also meets His righteous requirements.</li>
	<li>God caused the Lord Jesus to shed His blood on the cross in order that He might redeem us from our sins. Such a redemption shows God&rsquo;s love on one hand and God&rsquo;s righteousness on the other. Because God loves us, He gave His Son for us. Because God is righteous, He required the sacrifice of His Son in our stead.</li>
	<li>The Son of God shed His blood on the cross for our redemption. This blood became the fountain of cleansing. This blood not only cleanses away our sins and evildoings according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, but also causes us to realize God&rsquo;s love, so that we will no longer partake of such evil-doings.<br />
	<em>Repeat this point.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to be cleansed from sins
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are sinful.</li>
	<li>Receive the Lord Jesus and the redemption of His cross.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
