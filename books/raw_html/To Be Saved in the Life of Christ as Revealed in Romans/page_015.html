	<h2 class=head2>The Transfiguration of Our Body</h2><p>God’s glorifying us is also considered by the apostle Paul as the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21). This is carried out in the virtue of the divine life, to save us from our body of humiliation. Our body will be transfigured by the power, the virtue, of the divine life. The divine life is within us today transfiguring us. Actually, transformation is a form of transfiguration. When the inner life transforms us from within, this is a kind of saturation. This saturation is a kind of transfiguration. When the divine life saturates our entire being, it transfigures us, changing us metabolically. This metabolic change is not merely an outward change in form. It is brought about by a new element being added into our being. This new element discharges the old element. Thus, we are changed and transformed. Such transformation takes place by the life saturation, the life power, the virtue, of the divine life.<h2 class=head2>The Redemption of Our Body</h2><p>The transfiguration of our body is also considered by the apostle Paul as the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). This is carried out through the indwelling Spirit of the firstfruit, which is the foretaste (Rom. 8:11, 23a). The indwelling Spirit transforms us by saturating us all day long. This saturation is the sealing, the “inking,” of the Spirit (Eph. 1:13). The Holy Spirit seals us with the divine ink, and the Spirit Himself as the ink carries out a continuous inking within us. This inking transfigures us, and one day the form of our body will be changed to the uttermost. That day will be the day of the redemption of our body, the day of the glorification of our body. That day has not yet come, but today we have the indwelling Spirit as the firstfruit, the foretaste, of God as our portion. Day by day, something within us is sealing, inking, and saturating us. The Spirit seals us unto the day of redemption (Eph. 4:30), unto the redemption of the acquired possession (Eph. 1:13-14), unto the redemption of our body. The Spirit’s sealing is for and issues in the redemption of our body. In this sense, the redemption of our body will not be something which happens in a sudden way, as if by accident. Today, we are under the inking, the saturating of the inner life, by the indwelling Spirit. Thus, bit by bit, we are being redeemed. One day our entire being will be fully redeemed. The matter of our rapture, the redemption of our body, is a matter of maturity. We have the divine life and we are growing in the divine life. The full maturity of the divine life in us is the redemption of our body.<h2 class=head2>By the Saturation of Our Body of Humiliation with the Glory, the Expression of the Divine Splendor, of the Divine Life in Christ</h2><p>The transfiguration of our body is by the saturation of our body of humiliation with the glory, the expression of the divine splendor, of the divine life in Christ (Rom. 8:30c). Glory is the expression of the divine splendor of the divine life. We have the divine life within us, and this divine life has its splendor. In the Bible this splendor is called glory. When we are glorified, we will be saturated thoroughly with the splendor of the divine life. This glorification is the transfiguration of our body, the redemption of our body<h2 class=head2>The Completion of the Divine Sonship</h2><p>Our glorification, the transfiguration of our body, and the redemption of our body are also considered by the apostle Paul as the completion of our divine sonship. At the time when we will be glorified by God and our body will be transfigured and redeemed, we will be manifested as the sons of God to the fullest extent. Because our whole being, including our outward body, will be saturated and permeated with the divine splendor, everyone will see that we are the sons of God. This is the completion of our divine sonship. God’s glorifying us, the transfiguration and the redemption of our body for the completion of our divine sonship, will be the consummate step, the final step, of our being saved in the divine life of Christ. In this way, the book of Romans comprises all the items of God’s redemption and God’s saving in His full salvation.
