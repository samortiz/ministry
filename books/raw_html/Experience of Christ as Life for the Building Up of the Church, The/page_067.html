<P>We cannot find one instance of the word church in 2 Corinthians in the sense of the universal church. There are altogether eight verses with the word churches. Have you ever noticed them? I venture to say that many have not. They have noticed the church, but not the churches. They have begun, but they have not advanced. Second Corinthians is not the beginning; it is the advance in the local churches.</P><P>Do not think that I am boasting or being critical. It is a fact that many Christians know the church but not the churches because they have not improved. It is abundantly clear in the Word that the churches are a step beyond the church. With the church we are in doctrine, in theory, but with the churches we come into the practice and reality. Many speak about the church as the Body of Christ, about the Body life and the Body ministry. Some speak of the New Testament church. But where is the reality of the local church life? Some even speak despitefully of the local church. If they are right, we had better remove 2 Corinthians from the New Testament. This book is full of the local churches.</P><P>Every truth in the Bible develops progressively, and the truth of the church is no exception. The church was first mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16 (v. 18). That was the seed. But immediately after chapter sixteen, the Lord touched the local aspect of the church. In chapter sixteen there is the church, while in chapter eighteen there is the church in a locality, the church to which you can go. If you have some problem, you must "tell it to the church" (v. 17). Then in the book of Acts, we see the growing up of this seed into all the local churches&#151;the church at Jerusalem (8:1), the church at Antioch (13:1), etc. Following this, in the Epistles there is the definition of the church. Finally, in 2 Corinthians and in Revelation, the local churches are strongly emphasized. The local churches are the harvest of the truth concerning the church.</P><P>With the teaching regarding this matter in the Bible, there is no ambiguity. It is exceedingly clear. By constant repetition and emphasis the Lord has driven this matter home. The final confirmation is in Revelation 1:11: "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea." There are seven cities with seven churches&#151;not seven churches in one city, but seven churches in seven cities. There should be one church in one city, and one city for one church. Nothing could be clearer.</P>
