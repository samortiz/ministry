   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO PARTIES FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all know the sad story.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the glorious God came into man s spirit, Satan, the enemy of God, came into man first.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The devil came into the human body through Adam when he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consequently, sin, personified as a person, is dwelling in the members of our body and rules as an illegal master, forcing us to do things that we dislike.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the sin mentioned in Romans 6, 7, and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This sin is none other than Satan, the evil, sinful one in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he came into our body, our body was transmuted, or changed in nature, and thus became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The flesh is the corrupted, ruined, and damaged body, in which the evil one dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This flesh threatens to dominate the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The human spirit has become a base from which God can spread Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same principle, the corrupted body, the flesh possessed by Satan, has become the base from which he can do his devilish work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan takes his place in the flesh to influence the soul, and then through the soul to deaden the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The direction of all satanic work always begins from the outside and works toward the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the divine work always begins from the center and spreads toward the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may illustrate this by the following diagram.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The soul cannot stand against Satan, who is much stronger than the human soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our condition before we were saved was that our soul was poisoned by Satan through the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we heard the gospel and were enlightened in our mind and in our conscience, we became contrite and broken in spirit, repented, and opened ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consequently, He gloriously came into our spirit to be our life in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although Satan, the enemy, has taken the flesh as a base from which to fight inwardly toward the spirit, the glorious Lord uses the spirit as a base from which to fight outwardly toward the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are very complicated because we have become a battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are the universal battlefield for the universal battle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan and God, God and Satan, are fighting one another within us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan is fighting toward the center, while God is fighting toward the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is our attitude toward this battle?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We cannot be neutral; we must take sides.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the outward part of man is the enemy of God, and in the inward part is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Between the two, in the middle, is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Satan is in the corrupted body, God is in the regenerated spirit, and we are between, in the human soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are very important persons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can change the whole situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we take sides with Satan, God, in a sense, will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, God can never be defeated, but by our taking sides with Satan, it seems that God is temporarily defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if we take sides with God, the situation will be glorious, and Satan will be utterly defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With whom will you take sides?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to listen to the Lord s words in Matthew 16:24: If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In other words, we must put the soul to death on the cross, for the soul is the self.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must always deny the self, always put the self to death, always cross out the self.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What will happen when the soul has been crossed out?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the soul has been put to death, only God and Satan are left.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By crossing out the soul, we have burned the bridge for the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Satan is in the flesh, because he is sin incarnated in the flesh, and the self is in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both sin and the self are illegally married to each other; in fact, they had their wedding day long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All the trouble within us is due to the fact that the self is married to sin, and the two have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when we were saved, God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit came into our spirit as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the flesh, the corrupted body, there is sin; in the soul, the threatened soul, there is the self; and in the regenerated human spirit there is the divine life, the eternal life, which is the regulating life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To live and walk by the soulish life means to live and walk by our self, which involves us in marriage with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This marriage means that we are not a free person but are under the bondage of the evil one as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The evil one in our flesh will rise up to snatch and defeat us and bring us under his captivity, making us a most wretched person Rom 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If, however, we deny the soul, the self, and live and walk by the spirit, Christ as life will regulate and saturate our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>THE CROSS DEALING WITH THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After we have been regenerated, we should not live and walk and do things by our self anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As long as we live by our self, we will be under the bondage of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Perhaps you may say, I don t think I live or do things by my self.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, you need to discern your spirit from your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you do this, you will see how much you are in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You say that you are not living or doing things by your self, but I would ask, By what are you living?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>By the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Probably you will answer, No, I am not living by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then, are you living by the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You may say, I doubt it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you are living neither by the flesh nor by the spirit, by what are you living?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The answer is that you are living merely by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You may say, I don t like to commit any sin; I don t like to be fleshly; I don t like to cooperate with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I love God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I like to follow the Lord and walk in the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I like, I like, I like...</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This indicates that you are still in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You need to tell the Lord where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You yourself doubt very much that you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you are not in the flesh or in the spirit, you are in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Praise the Lord that you are not in Egypt, for you have experienced the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You have been delivered out of Egypt, but you have not yet entered into the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You are still wandering in the wilderness of the soul.</S>
