Both Book II and Book III conclude with the same glorious event. Such a conclusion, however, is not found at the end of Book I of the Psalms, because at that point the message of the Psalms is not yet complete. At the end of Book II everything is completed. We have Christ in the deeper experiences of the saints, and we have the house and the city; therefore, Christ is set forth as the One who is coming to reign over the entire earth. After the desolation, then, in Book III, we have the restoration of all that was gained in Book II. Therefore, Book III must contain all that was originally found in Book II. In Book II we had the house and the city with Christ reigning over the earth, and now in Book III, in the restoration, we have the same thing-the house and the city, with Christ reigning over the entire earth. In Book III, everything in Book II has been restored: the enjoyment of God is restored, the experience of Christ is restored, the appreciation and love for the house and the city have been restored, and Christ reigning over the entire earth has been restored. Therefore Book III is nearly the same as Book II. This is very significant.<h2 class=head1>SONS OF A REBEL COMPOSE SONGS OF RESTORATION</h2><p>Now let us consider briefly the authorship of the Psalms. Many Christians presume that all the Psalms were composed by David. As far as Book I is concerned, this maybe true; at least most of the Psalms in Book I were written by David. But have you noticed that all the Psalms from Psalm 42 through Psalm 48-all these deeper and more precious Psalms-were not written by David. Psalm 68, that glorious and climactic Psalm, was indeed written by David. Psalm 72, however, was written by Solomon, and Psalms 73 and 80 were written by some other author. Notice now the authorship of Psalms 42, 45 through 48, 84, and 87, which include some of the deepest Psalms of Books II and III. All these deeper Psalms were written by the sons of Korah. This is remarkable. Numbers 26 gives us the background of these men: &#8220;This is that Dathan and Abiram which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the Lord: and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died...notwithstanding the sons of Korah died not&#8221; (vv. 9-11). This chapter makes reference to the rebellion of a group of God&#8217;s people under the leadership of Korah. When God intervened to vindicate and judge, Korah was devoured, but his children were spared. Had they died, we would not have all those wonderful, deeper Psalms, which we have mentioned. The sons of a leading rebel composed all those Psalms concerning God&#8217;s restoration. This is a real restoration.<p>When I first realized this, something leaped within me. We can tell the whole universe, &#8220;Satan, look at this; I do not care how much you can do; you may even cause some brothers to be rebellious. But, look out, some of their sons will be spared to write the deeper Psalms of God&#8217;s restoration.&#8221;<p>Almost all of the deeper Psalms, the Psalms which are so sweet and precious to us, were written by the sons of Korah. The sons of Korah wrote Psalm 42:1, &#8220;As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.&#8221; The sons of Korah, not David or Solomon wrote Psalm 45:1, &#8220;My heart is bubbling over with a good thing. I speak what I have composed touching the King.&#8221; Can you imagine this? Psalms 46 and 48, those marvelous Psalms on the city of God, were written by the sons of Korah. The Holy Spirit does not mention their names, but refers to them only as the sons of Korah. Regardless of what the enemy can do, the Lord always wins a glorious victory! It was the sons of Korah who wrote, &#8220;How lovely are thy dwelling places&#8221; (Psa. 84:1). How much blessing has been brought through the sons of Korah to so many saints by Psalm 84. Psalm 87, that gem of a Psalm concerning Zion and those who are born there, was written by the sons of Korah. Satan may say, &#8220;Look, I caused this one to be rebellious.&#8221; But we may tell him, &#8220;Just wait, some sons of Korah will come out. What you destroy, God will raise up again, and the psalms of God&#8217;s restoration will be composed by the sons of Korah, the sons of the leading rebel.&#8221;<p>Whenever I read Numbers 26 as a youth, I hated Korah. But almost all the deeper Psalms were written by the sons of this rebel. This is God&#8217;s marvelous, miraculous doing. What assurance we may have that God is going to recover the local churches and that eventually many sons of rebels will compose some praising psalms! Just one Korah rebelled, but many sons came out of him and became composers of the deeper Psalms.<p>To compose a hymn or write a psalm requires many experiences. This proves that the sons of Korah had gained many deeper experiences of Christ, of the house, and of the city. They were firstly deeper in the things of God (Psa. 42), then deeper in the experiences of Christ (Psa. 45), then deeper in the experiences of the city (Psa. 46, 48, and 87), and even the deepest in the experiences of the house (Psa. 84). This is solid confirmation and assurance that one day the Lord will recover all things. One day He will return and reign over the whole earth. The local churches are for that.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Church Revealed and Typified in the Psalms &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
