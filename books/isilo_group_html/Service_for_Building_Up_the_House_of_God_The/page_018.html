<p>We must guard against restricting the Spirit. Although we are learning many spiritual lessons, such as submitting to authority, keeping the order in the work, and not being independent, there is still the danger that we may restrict the Spirit. The work of the Spirit is often contrary to our expectations. He does not abide by the boundaries that we define. We often want the Spirit to abide by our rules, but He does not abide by our rules. The Spirit often makes exceptions to our ways.</p>
<p>There are examples in the Old Testament. Samuel was not a descendant of Aaron and should not have been a priest. The word of God, however, came not to Eli the priest but to Samuel (1 Sam. 3). The Spirit left the priestly circle to do something new. Samuel did not have any experience, and the elderly Eli did not understand. Samuel heard God call him but did not understand, so he ran to Eli and said, &ldquo;Here I am, for you called me,&rdquo; but Eli said to him, &ldquo;I did not call. Go back and lie down&rdquo; (v. 5). When God called Samuel a second time, Samuel went to Eli again, and again Eli told Samuel to go back and lie down (v. 6). It was not until the third time that Eli perceived it was Jehovah who was calling Samuel (v. 8). Although Eli was old, he feared God and did not restrict His work, because he told Samuel to then say, &ldquo;Speak, O Jehovah; for Your servant is listening&rdquo; (v. 9).</p>
<p>David is another example. God rejected Saul from being king over Israel and found a young man, David, to replace Saul (16:1-13). Saul and David&rsquo;s older brothers despised the young David and did not think that he was useful. However, God does not work according to our expectations.</p>
<p>God does not raise up useful persons only among elders, deacons, or co-workers. He can make exceptions. God often does things in secret; He does a hidden work in man&rsquo;s heart. The co-workers and the responsible ones should not be so proud as to say, &ldquo;God does not have anyone whom He can use besides us co-workers and responsible ones.&rdquo; Such a dangerous attitude is a snare.</p>
<p>Just as the wind blows where it wills, so also is the Holy Spirit. For the past two thousand years no one has been able to confine the Spirit. When we are comfortable and think that we know everything, the Holy Spirit may raise up someone else. The Spirit does not like pride or display and is not subject to our control. He needs us to be subject to His authority; we cannot restrict Him.</p>
<p>The Spirit is not subject to regulations. Peter, John, and James in the early church did not understand this matter. Although they considered themselves to be ministers in the New Testament age, God unexpectedly chose someone outside their circle. The Spirit went to Saul of Tarsus, who opposed the Lord and was persecuting the church. The Lord said to Saul, &ldquo;It is hard for you to kick against the goads&rdquo; (Acts 26:14). The Lord was determined to use Saul. A goad is a sharp-pointed stick on a plow for subduing the cattle yoked to the plow. If the cattle are stubborn or not submissive, they are prodded with the goad. Many times a cow kicks at the plow and hits the sharp-pointed stick. The Lord said, &ldquo;It is hard for you to kick against the goads,&rdquo; meaning, &ldquo;It is better to submit conscientiously.&rdquo; The Spirit not only reached a person who was rebellious but also captured him.</p>
<p>After his salvation Saul was brought by the Spirit to Jerusalem. The disciples in Jerusalem feared him; they did not believe that he was a disciple (9:26). The disciples could not believe that the Spirit would raise up such a person as Saul. If I were Peter or James, I would have said, &ldquo;Lord, I am really puzzled. Why did You raise up this man from among our persecutors?&rdquo; The Lord would have said, &ldquo;No doubt you are puzzled, for My ways are higher than your ways. Do not think that you can limit Me to your small circle. I will jump out whenever you try to restrict Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our attitude should be that everything is in the hands of the Spirit, not in our hands. When we define the way that God should work, He will often leave our restrictions and go to someone else. It does not matter whether that person was opposing God and loving the world. Hence, to define a boundary for the Spirit is to restrict His work. If we restrict the Spirit, He may react and set us aside. As a result, we will lose the flow of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Spiritual matters are not in our hands. We must learn to be faithful but not restrict the Spirit. The Lord must have a free way, and we must not be loose. We must learn the lessons on life and know the flesh. We do not have the freedom to do what we think is right. We must not be persons who live according to the flesh. In relation to the work of the Spirit, David and Saul of Tarsus did not live according to the flesh, and they were not presumptuous, unruly, or rebellious. Saul of Tarsus persecuted the believers, but he was chosen by God. This seems to be contradictory.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there should not be any control among us. Spiritual control restricts the work of the Spirit. On the other hand, we should not be presumptuous. The absence of control does not mean that we may be loose and express our opinions freely. This is the flesh. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, may we be those who know the Spirit and do not restrict Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Service for Building Up the House of God &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
