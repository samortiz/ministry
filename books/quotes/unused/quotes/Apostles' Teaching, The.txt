Many Christians have never heard a message regarding the apostles' teaching, and it may be that they have never even heard such terminology
John Nelson Darby and other Brethren teachers stressed that we must continue in the apostles' teaching and in the apostles' fellowship
If we intend to continue in the fellowship of the apostles, we must first continue in the teaching of the apostles
If a president does something that is contrary to the Constitution, he will no longer be justified in remaining in office
During this past year some said that the church is the church of the saints, just as a democratic country is a country of the people
It is sad that nearly all of Christianity does not know the apostles' teaching or even that there is such a thing
While God was speaking in the Son, one day the Son told His disciples, 'I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now
It is as though the Lord Jesus was saying, 'When the Spirit of reality comes, He will bring you into all the reality
In the Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation, God spoke further, in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles
Paul was used by the Lord in his speaking to complete the word of God, especially concerning the mystery of the Triune God
Paul completed the part of God's speaking that concerns the mystery of the Triune God, but John completed the entire speaking of God
The first step of His plan was to become incarnated, to get Himself mingled with man in order to enter into man
The all-inclusive death of Christ also dealt with Satan, the serpent , and with the world , which is hanging on Satan
The resurrection of Jesus Christ testifies that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God in Him and with Him
Our being justified in Him is the objective justification, and our being justified with Him is the subjective justification
The resurrection of Christ also imparted the divine life into the believers of Jesus Christ and begot them as the many sons of God
Finally, this resurrection consummated the Triune God and made the Spirit of God the ultimate consummation of the Triune God as the Spirit
Through incarnation He obtained the human nature; yet He was still short of something in that He had never entered into death
Even after He died on the cross, the Triune God was still short of something because He had not yet entered into resurrection
The Spirit of God is now released, and the Spirit of God is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God as the Spirit
The Spirit is the Bridegroom, and the regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite man is the bride
At the end of the Bible there is a wonderful couple who constitute a wonderful story of the Bridegroom with the bride
After Mary realized who He was, she tried to touch Him, but He would not allow her to do so because He had not yet ascended to the Father
At that time the angels came to declare that Christ would come back in the same way as they saw Him ascend to the heavens
The great image in the prophecy in Daniel chapter two has a head of gold breasts and arms of silver an abdomen of brass and two legs of iron
We may not like blood and flesh, but God desired to partake of man's blood and flesh so that He could be the same as we are
Over the centuries Christians have disputed over the kind of water-hot, cold, fresh, or salt water-in which people should be baptized
In this country there are nine very skilled Supreme Court justices who have the responsibility of interpreting the Constitution
A recent publication was put out by some opposing ones indicating that God's economy is in opposition to deputy authority
A few brothers and sisters have caused a division in the Lord's recovery, and they are speaking and writing quite freely
If something had happened among them like the situation we are encountering today, they would have promptly excommunicated the instigators
Although through the years we have suffered from the dissenting and opposing ones, we would not pursue the practice of excommunication
The quarantine is exercised to keep that member safe and to keep the whole family from being contaminated with the illness
If we say that we are for Christ and the church, we must know what Christ is, and we must know what the church is
The sixth and seventh sections of God's New Testament economy concern the kingdom and the New Jerusalem, respectively
Between these two ends are Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, the outpouring of the Spirit, and the kingdom
The resurrection of Christ testifies that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God in Him and with Him
The resurrection imparted the divine life into the believers of Jesus Christ and begot them as the many sons of God
Finally, the resurrection consummated the Triune God and made the Spirit of God the ultimate consummation of the Triune God as the Spirit
The secret part was for Christ to be presented to God as the firstfruit of the harvest and for God to taste His freshness in resurrection
He resurrected to be the life-giving Spirit and to be the firstborn Son of God, generating us to be the many sons of God
He did not yet have the element of humanity or the element of death and although He was resurrection He had never experienced resurrection
He now has the divine element, the human element, the element of death, the element of resurrection, and the element of ascension
If you compare God before His process and God after His process, you will find that there is quite a difference
Even in His death, the process lasted six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning to three o'clock in the afternoon
The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God
According to the New Testament, when Christ ascended to the heavens, He received the Holy Spirit from the Father and with the Father
The Lord Jesus poured out this Spirit, who is one with the Father, in such a way that the Lord was one with the Spirit and with the Father
Eventually the One who poured out was the One who was poured out, and this One is the Triune God in His consummation
We all were baptized in that consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, and we all were baptized into one Body
Suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
To be baptized into the Triune God is to be baptized into Christ, because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God
The corporate baptism of all the believers into the one Body was applied to us at the time we believed into Christ
Such insistence becomes a different teaching and a wind of teaching that blows the saints away from the Body of Christ thus causing division
All the believers were baptized into one Body in order that they might be the Body of Christ having Christ as the Head
My reply to him was that that vine was not nearly the size of the true vine that is spreading all around the globe
Because of this, it is sometimes possible to recognize a person even though he is turned away so that his face is not visible
In the New Jerusalem, all the saints, including the Old Testament and the New Testament saints, become the consummated wife of Christ
The universal new man is being consummated by being renewed through the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man
Whether we are Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English, Dutch, or American, we all have our particular racial character
If day by day we put off the old man and put on the new man, the only character we will possess will be the character of Christ
Lord, we thank You for the cleansing of Your precious blood, and we thank You that we are gathered into Your name again
The source of these aspects of the Body is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God
As the processed Triune God, He poured Himself out as the Holy Spirit to baptize all His chosen ones, the believers in Christ, into one Body
The church must be of God as the essence, of Christ as the element in life, and of the saints as the human components
Since it is uniquely one in the whole universe the church is universal comprising all the believers in Christ in all times and in all places
The Old Testament saints, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Moses, David, and Isaiah, were not members of the New Testament church
Once we clearly see that which is the teaching of the apostles, we can see that which is not the teaching of the apostles
The entire New Testament concerns God's New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem
The second thing is the all-inclusive death of Christ, the third is the resurrection of Christ, and the fourth is the ascension of Christ
The fifth item of God's New Testament economy is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body
In this message we shall begin to consider an additional aspect of the one Body-the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens
Very few students of the Bible know what the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens is
In this message we shall cover the kingdom of God, and in the next message we shall consider the kingdom of the heavens
The kingdom of God is the realm of God's governmental administration, which like His existence, is from eternity to eternity
The divine life was only partially revealed in the Old Testament, but the divine life is a particular characteristic of the New Testament
If we desire to enter into the New Testament section of the kingdom of God, we must be born of the Spirit; we must have another life
To enter the animal kingdom, we must have the animal life, and to enter the vegetable kingdom, we must have the vegetable life
By our physical birth we were born into the kingdom of man, and by the divine birth we, as men, are born into the kingdom of God
The realm of God's governmental administration has a section of the divine life in the New Testament economy of God
Mark 1:15 indicates that at the time the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, the kingdom of God had only drawn near
In Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus preached the gospel, saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near'
The Lord Jesus was the Sower, and He sowed Himself as the seed of life into Peter, John, James, and all the disciples
It was in the new section of the kingdom of God that God came to sow Himself as the seed of life into His chosen people
The kingdom of God in the new section is God Himself as the seed of life that is sown into us and grows to be the kingdom of God
The seed of life, which is God Himself, not only produces the kingdom of God; it grows to be the kingdom of God
Since Jesus was there, God was there; and since God was there, the kingdom of God was there, for the kingdom of God is God Himself
As we preach the gospel, going to visit people by knocking on their doors, we are spreading the kingdom of God
We are bringing the kingdom of God into those homes, because our going is with the purpose of dispensing God into people
They taught that the church and the kingdom are different, that the church is present but the kingdom is yet to come
In the second part of chapter three, these sinners are redeemed , and in chapter four, these redeemed sinners are justified
The remainder of the book of Romans, chapters twelve through sixteen, gives a clear presentation of the life of the Body of Christ
Mere outward blessings often are vanity; but tribulations, sufferings, and afflictions always bring us many genuine blessings
Prayer: Lord, we worship and thank You that You have gathered us into Yourself, into Your name, around Your word
Lord, give us the utterance and the proper understanding, and bring us into the truth that we may know You according to Your Word
The kingdom of the heavens is the last item related to the Body that was constituted by the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit as the consummated Triune God was for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body
All the believers universally, in space and in time, were baptized in this outpouring of the Spirit into one Body
The first three items-the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, and the universal new man-are related to Christ
The kingdom of the heavens is the strict section of the kingdom of God , while the kingdom of God is the kingdom in a broad sense
In the previous message we saw that the kingdom of God is a wide sphere and that, like God's existence, it is eternal
God's kingdom was in existence long before man was created, because at that time the angels were under God's rule
The church age is approximately two thousand years in length, and the kingdom age is exactly one thousand years
Together, these two ages constitute the sphere, the realm, of the kingdom of the heavens, which will last approximately three thousand years
The New Jerusalem, which will come after the millennium, is not included in the kingdom of the heavens; it is a part of the kingdom of God
The kingdom of the heavens is in the New Testament economy of God and includes the church age and the kingdom age
Again the two verses are nearly the same except that Matthew refers to the kingdom of the heavens whereas Mark refers to the kingdom of God
The kingdom of the heavens has not been suspended, and we are not waiting for the kingdom of the heavens to come
Without a proper understanding of these three aspects, we could never understand such a subject as the kingdom of the heavens in the Bible
The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is a living that surpasses that of the law, with the highest standard of ethics
Such a living is the expression of the processed Triune God mingled with the regenerated and transformed believers
The degree of transformation we have experienced depends on how much we have given the Lord the opportunity to mingle Himself with us
We all enjoy the same Lord, but there is a difference in our enjoyment based on the degree of our transformation
In order to be perfect, we must be perfected, and the only way for us to be perfected is to be mingled with the Father
Without the heavenly Father's mingling of Himself with us, there is no way for us to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect
On the day of Pentecost, he was not as fully perfected as he was when he wrote his two epistles, 1 Peter and 2 Peter
Whatever we do, whatever we are, whatever we say, however we act, and wherever we go will be for the building up of the Body of Christ
Matthew 16:18 says, 'I will build My church,' and verse 19 says, 'I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens'
One verse concerns the building up of the church, and the other verse concerns the establishing of the kingdom
The building up of the church is for the kingdom, and whatever the kingdom is, is for the building up of the church
If there is quarreling, debating, murmuring, and reasoning in a local church, there can be no rule of the heavens in that church
If those in that locality would live a life that brings the heavenly rule to the earth, then God's New Testament economy will be fulfilled
The reality of the kingdom of the heavens had its beginning with the formation of the church on the day of Pentecost
The first of these is the tares, signifying the nominal Christians, growing together with the wheat, the real believers
The second item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the mustard herb growing abnormally into a tree
The mustard in the Lord's parable grew abnormally into a large tree, as indicated by the fact that birds come to roost in its branches
When the mustard herb becomes abnormally large, the branches of its tree become the roosting place for the birds
The birds signify the persons and matters that are related to Satan, the enemy who sowed the tares among the wheat
The third item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is leaven taken by a woman and hidden in three measures of meal
The meal in which the woman hid the leaven is the fine flour for making the meal offering , signifying Christ as food to both God and man
Unless we have a keen discernment to see through the good outward appearance, we will not be able to detect the leaven
The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens began immediately after the formation of the church on the day of Pentecost
Immediately after the baptism of all the believers, possibly even the next day, Satan came in to sow the tares
When farmers sow wheat, they may examine each individual grain, yet tares will still appear as the wheat grows
The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed by the Lord's prophecy on the Mount of Olives in Matthew 24 and 25
The thousand year kingdom will have two parts: the upper part as the heavenly part and the lower part as the earthly part
In the heavenly part will be the overcoming saints including both those in the Old Testament such as Abraham and those in the New Testament
At the Lord's coming back, all Israel will be saved , but they will not be transfigured right away; they will remain in the body of flesh
The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is also for the overcoming saints as priests to serve God and Christ
These three major items are the ministry of Christ in His ascension, the second coming of Christ, and the rapture of the saints
The heavenly ministry of Christ, the second coming of Christ, and our rapture are three crucial items of the apostles' teaching
In His ascension Christ is also far above all rule, authority, power, lordship, and every name in this age and in the age to come
Christ has been seated far above everything, not only the things in this age, but also those in the coming age
In His ascension Christ is the most glorious One, the most honorable One, the most powerful One, and the highest authority
Revelation 4 and 5 show us a picture of the scene in the heavens immediately after Christ's ascension into the heavens
In Revelation 5 Christ as the Lamb of God was standing in the midst of the four living creatures and the elders
That scroll can be likened to a 'schedule sheet' of what will happen from the ascension of Christ to the New Jerusalem
He is God's anointed One to carry out God's commission, the great commission of God's eternal, New Testament economy
As the Christ, He has been commissioned and appointed by God to carry out God's eternal plan, His eternal economy
As the Lord, He is the Possessor, the Owner, the One that has the power to possess all things, all matters, and all persons
He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the environment might be fit for God's chosen people to receive His salvation
Now Christ as the High Priest is taking care of us before the face of God, and He is taking care of us in our environment
Christ's earthly ministry began from His being baptized in water and anointed with the Holy Spirit and ended in His resurrection
The major items in the section of His earthly ministry are His human living, His crucifixion, and His resurrection
Christ's heavenly ministry began from His outpouring of the Holy Spirit and will end in His second appearing on the earth
In His heavenly ministry, as such a Victor, He will conquer all His enemies and bring in His kingdom to this earth
Now in the heavens, Christ is ministering, and His ministry in the heavens today is for His church and His believers
Christ's former ministry on this earth started from His being baptized in water and anointed with the Holy Spirit
We have stressed that we have to visit people for the preaching of the gospel to get them to believe and be baptized
Not many Christians realize that today Christ is working in the heavens to take care of the churches and His believers
When the sisters are looking for sales in the newspaper in the way of self-indulgence, they are out of Christ's sanctification
It can be an agreement signed by two parties, in which the first party promises what he will do for the second party
Christ is the Mediator, the Executor, of the new covenant to guarantee the effectiveness of the new covenant as its surety
His humanity qualifies Him to be such a High Priest because He can sympathize with us in the things related to our human life
While Jesus was on earth, He sympathized with the suffering ones, but He was also able to help them because of His divine life
He can sympathize with us because He is a man, and He can do everything that is needed for us because He is God
He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
Spurgeon said that often our forgiving can be likened to burying a dead dog while leaving its tail sticking out above the earth
When we come forward to God through Christ our High Priest He saves us in the power of His resurrection and by the law of the Spirit of life
The word denotes consoling and consolation; hence, it can be translated 'Comforter,' as it is in the Gospel of John
Christ administrates the universe under the headship of God because God has given Christ to be the Head over all things
Revelation 1 and 5 tell us that Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth , while Revelation 17 and 19 say that He is the King of kings
Also, as the Head of all things to rule the entire universe, He is managing the environment on this earth for us
After fellowshipping concerning the ministry of Christ in His ascension in messages six and seven, we now come to the rapture of the saints
In this matter we are on their shoulders to have some further studies, and the Lord has continuously shown us something more
The apostles' teaching is concerning God's New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem
Romans 5:10 says that since we have been reconciled to God through the death of Christ, much more we shall be saved in the life of Christ
The redemption of our body is through the saturation of the divine element by the sealing of the Spirit of God
The sealing will saturate our entire body, until our entire being will be permeated and saturated with the divine element as the sealing ink
The redemption of our body to transfigure the nature and the condition of our body of humiliation is also the full sonship of God
The redemption of our body, which is the transfiguration of our body of humiliation, will be the glorification of our entire being
The great tribulation will last three and a half years, beginning from the sixth seal and ending at the seventh bowl
These three and a half years will be the second half of the last week, the last seven years, of the present age
Many centuries ago the Jews lost their nation, they became captives, and they were scattered on the earth among the Gentiles
The Bible promised that one day the Lord would bring them back to their fathers' land and restore the nation of Israel
In 1967, nineteen years after the nation of Israel had been restored, the city of Jerusalem was reclaimed by the Jews
In Russia and eastern Europe, the practice of communism has actually been the practice of autocracy, dictatorship
In the midst of the seven years, he will break the covenant and begin to persecute the children of Israel and the Christians
Before the general harvest the firstfruit is reaped brought into the sanctuary the house of God and presented to God for His fresh enjoyment
The man-child, which includes all the dead overcomers, is different from the firstfruit, who are the living overcomers
They are living in the heavens today, and they will be standing with the Lamb in the heavens on Mount Zion in the future
The second section of the rapture is the section of the majority of the saints, including the resurrected ones and the remaining ones
The majority of the saints will be raptured to the Lord's barn in the air within the clouds, where Christ's parousia will be then
As we have seen, the firstfruit is brought from the field into the temple of God, the house of God, for God's enjoyment and satisfaction
Revelation 11:2 and 3 tell us that these two witnesses will prophesy for a thousand two hundred and sixty days
On the day the two witnesses are raptured, Antichrist will be thrown into the lake of fire, and the children of Israel all will repent
They have to pass through the time of three and a half years of the great tribulation to be disciplined for their maturity
At His judgment seat, He will decide who among His saints should be rewarded as overcomers and who should be disciplined as defeated ones
Antichrist will kill them, and their corpses will lie on the street of the city of Jerusalem for three and a half days
These four seals began from the ascension of Christ and will continue to the supernatural calamities in the sixth seal
While the gospel is being preached, as indicated by the first seal, there is always the martyrdom of the faithful saints
There is the man-child, composed of the resurrected martyrs who should participate in 'the extra resurrection,' 'the better resurrection'
Some Christians surely will be slain because in Revelation 15, these slain ones will be resurrected and raptured
Revelation 20:4 also mentions these martyrs in the great tribulation who would not worship the beast and his image
When the Lord comes to earth, He will consider them as sheep'' and make them the people on the earth in the millennium
The first four trumpets will be the intensified supernatural calamities to damage all the sources of natural provisions for men's living
All the provisions for us to live on earth were prepared by God, but all these will be damaged with the first four trumpets
The fifth trumpet, which is the first woe, is God's judgment on men to torment men by Satan collaborating with Antichrist
There will not be much difference in time between the sixth seal, in Revelation 6:12-17, and the first five trumpets, in Revelation 8:7-9:11
Antichrist, the angel of the abyss, will be the king over the tormenting locusts, with the name of Abaddon in Hebrew, and Apollyon in Greek
In those five months, men will seek death and long to die, but by no means will they find it, because death will flee from them
The rest of the men who have not been killed by these plagues will not repent of their idolatry murders witchcrafts fornication and thefts
The rainbow is upon His head as a reminder of the covenant God made with Noah concerning the existence of the living creatures on the earth
The rapture of the majority of the saints will be to the Lord's barn in the air within the clouds , where Christ's parousia will then be
The majority of the saints will be raptured not to the peak of the universe, to Zion in the third heavens, but to the air
What they will do in Revelation 1156 is just like the deeds of Moses and Elijah who appeared before the Lord on the mount of transfiguration
They will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, when the holy city, Jerusalem, will be trampled by Antichrist for forty-two months
We have seen that the contents of the seventh trumpet include the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ and the judgment of the dead
The first woe is the fifth trumpet, the second woe is the sixth trumpet, and the third woe is the seven bowls of the seventh trumpet
The first four bowls are the consummating supernatural calamities to utterly damage men's habitation in the universe
The first bowl will be God's further judgment on the earth, causing an evil and malignant sore upon the worshippers of Antichrist
The second bowl will be God's further judgment on the sea, causing the sea to become blood and every living soul in the sea to die
The third bowl will be God's further judgment on the rivers and springs, causing them to become blood that men have to drink
The fourth bowl will be Gods further judgment on the sun causing it to burn men with fire and men being burned to blaspheme the name of God
During the gathering of the kings by the three unclean spirits, the Lord will remind the remaining living saints concerning His coming
The seventh bowl will be the concluding plague of the great tribulation: the greatest earthquake and the great hail
After Christ has defeated and destroyed Antichrist and his followers, Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, the bottomless pit
After this judgment on the nations, the Lord will set up the millennial kingdom, the kingdom of Christ for a thousand years
The rebellious nations will be devoured by fire from heaven and Satan the devil will be cast into the lake of fire to be tormented forever
There will be the eternal judgment at the great white throne to judge all the dead unbelievers throughout all the centuries
All these items are also the contents of the seventh trumpet which is the greater part of the seventh seal that will proceed forever
In Matthew 2436 the Lord said Concerning that day and hour no one knows neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son but the Father only
The Lord in Matthew 24:32-33 gives us some signs that we may know the period of His parousia which will be in the last part of the last week
The Lord says, 'Learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves'
By this kind of sign, we have to realize that we are now in a time which is very close to the last week of the present age
The day will come, however, when Christ will come openly to the earth, and all will see Him because His presence with us will be visible
The second half of these seven years, the last three and a half years of this age, will be the time of the great tribulation
Daniel 12:7 and Revelation 12:14 refer to these three and a half years as 'a time, and times, and half a time'
Revelation 11:2 and 3 tell us that this tribulation lasts forty-two months, or a thousand two hundred and sixty days
She is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and on her head there is a crown of twelve stars
Revelation 12 reveals that this rapture takes place before the three and a half years of the great tribulation
Eventually, His parousia will have an appearing, and that shining appearing will bring the Antichrist to nothing
Matthew 24:27 says, 'For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be'
The lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west means that the Lord's appearing will be around the globe
Christ will be clothed with a cloud in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash of lightning to the earth
The tribes mentioned here are the twelve tribes of the Holy Land who have pierced Him and who are referred to in Zechariah 12:10-14
When the Lord appears as lightning coming with power and glory to be seen by all in the Holy Land the twelve tribes will behold Him and weep
Revelation 14:1 shows that Christ and the firstfruit, the hundred and forty-four thousand, are standing on Mount Zion in the heavens
These verses refer to the rapture of the majority of the believers, including all the dead saints of the Old Testament
The man-child will be raptured to the throne of God in the heavens, and the firstfruit will be raptured to Mount Zion in the heavens
As believers in Christ, we should all expect to be raptured, but do we expect to be raptured to the throne or to the air?
After this rapture of all God's chosen people in both the Old and New Testament times, Christ will judge all the saints at His judgment seat
Matthew 24 says that the evil slave will have his portion with the hypocrites, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
In Matthew 25 the Lord tells a parable of a man going into another country and distributing talents to all his slaves
In this parable, the slaves with five and two talents fully used their gift and doubled what their master gave them
The Lord said that this useless slave will be cast out into the outer darkness where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
In Matthew 12 the Lord said that men shall have to give an account in the day of judgment concerning every idle word that they speak
Matthew 25:19 and Luke 19:15 both show that the Lord's servants will render an account to Him, and He will either reward or punish them
He will marry the overcomers, leaving the defeated ones in shame, in a position of punishment to be disciplined
As we have seen in Matthew 24:27, Christ's parousia will be like the lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west
As we have seen, Christ, together with His newly married overcomers, will come to defeat and destroy Antichrist and his followers
His coming will also be to judge the nations, to prepare the 'sheep' to be the people on the earth in the millennium
In Daniel 7:13 and 14, we are told that Christ as the Son of Man comes to God the Father to receive the kingdom from Him
Revelation 11:15 says that at the Lord's coming back the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ
We have to realize that there will be different judgments given by the Lord during and after His second coming
The main judgment will be the judgment concerning who will enjoy eternal salvation and who will suffer eternal perdition
In this message we want to see the truth concerning the kingdom of a thousand years revealed in Revelation 20:4-6
The ones selected to reign as kings in the kingdom of a thousand years will be the overcomers, the perfected ones
It began from the creation of Adam and concluded at the time that Moses received the law and passed the law on to the children of Israel
The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, depicted in Matthew 24 and 25, will be the thousand-year kingdom
God considers the kingdom of Israel in the millennium as a tabernacle, which is something temporary rather than permanent
The earthly section of the kingdom of a thousand years is also the restored kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of the Son of Man
In the kingdom of a thousand years, the dwelling place of the King is in the heavens, and the dwelling place of the people is on the earth
As the priests, the Israelites will teach the nations as the people to know God, to serve God, and to worship God
At the end of the great tribulation, Christ will come to defeat Antichrist and destroy all his followers at Armageddon
In the kingdom of a thousand years there will be a heavenly section with the overcomers of the Old Testament and of the New Testament
There will be an earthly section that will be the tabernacle of David, the kingdom of Christ as the Son of Man, and the kingdom of Messiah
In the earthly section, all the Jews will have been saved and regenerated, but they will have missed the age of the church
Some, such as Hymenaeus and Philetus, had spoken words that were like gangrene to damage and infect the saints
These situations are very disappointing, but despite these sufferings Paul had the Lord's appearing and His kingdom in view
Paul realized that Caesar Nero might kill him, but that meant nothing to him because the Lord would save him into His kingdom
On the one hand, the thousand-year kingdom should be an exercise to us, and on the other hand, it should be an encouragement to us
Someday we will be examined and measured concerning whether we will get the reward of the kingdom or miss it and receive some punishment
When Christ comes back, the defeated ones will be cast out into the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth
If we do not graduate in the Christian life in this age, the Lord will require us to learn some hard lessons in the next age
The mentioning of the New Jerusalem as a prize to the overcomer indicates that this promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom
If we read the Old Testament carefully, we will realize that some Old Testament saints such as Jacob and David were disciplined by the Lord
If we are not submissive in cooperating with God's grace and discipline in this age, God will discipline us in the next age
The decision will be made there concerning whether we will enter into glory or suffer loss in the thousand years
In 1 Corinthians 9:24-25 Paul says, 'Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?
Everyone who contends exercises selfcontrol in all things those therefore that they may receive a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible
In the light of this prize, Paul charged the Corinthian believers to run the race that they may obtain the reward
We need to remember, however, that it is the conclusion of the apostles' teaching and also the conclusion of the entire Bible
