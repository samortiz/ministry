   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A question naturally arises: To what extent should we be prepared to suffer?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible's standard is "Be faithful unto death" Rev 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, we have to be prepared for any suffering, even the suffering of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, we do not want to become an extremist.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet there is no compromise as far as a mind to suffer is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is any compromise, we would rather let the Lord do the compromising; we would rather let the church or the more mature brothers balance us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As for ourselves, we have to give our all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we compromise ourselves, how can we be effective in the work?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we consider our own life to be so precious, and hold ourselves carefully by the hand all the time, we will not accomplish much in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all have to be faithful even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord will not sacrifice our life simply because we have vowed to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, it is the Lord's business to preserve our life; we do not preserve it ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the Lord's business to arrange everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On our side, we have to be prepared to sacrifice ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to be prepared to face every kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers and sisters, if you love your life, you will not be able to be faithful even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who are faithful even unto death do not love their own life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the Lord's basic requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our mind to suffer should be so strong that we can say, "Lord, I will die for You!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not care for the circumstances around me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am willing to give up my life for You!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, without such a determination, we will stop as soon as we encounter difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every worker of the Lord has to learn to not love himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who love themselves are limited in their works.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When they reach a certain point, they will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God wants absolute men to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wants those who are willing to lay aside their life to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not worry about becoming an extremist.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is a totally different issue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On our part, we should never make any provision for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all should be absolute in our mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let me repeat: We do not have to suffer, but we all must have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must always be prepared to cast every care aside.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must cast aside not only our outward difficulties but should sacrifice our own health.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we love ourselves and are too afraid to give ourselves up, we will not accomplish much.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to tell the Lord, "I am willing to consecrate everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From now on, no suffering will stop me from serving You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is my choice, no matter what the outcome, whether it is death, life, suffering, or joy!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, only one thing is effective a service that is faithful even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we take this stand, the less Satan can do anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He will have no place to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who love themselves are truly bound by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A little pain and they are in constant tears and sighings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They love themselves too much!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not love ourselves, our tears and sighings will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brothers and sisters, we who are taking this way have to give up our very lives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we want to take this way, we have to say to the Lord, "Your ordained way for me may or may not be a way of suffering, but I am ready to meet any sufferings."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Forgive me for repeating this again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But we must realize that even though our suffering is limited, our mind to suffer should be unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The actual amount of suffering which the Lord has measured to us may be limited, but our readiness for suffering should be unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If our readiness for suffering is limited, it means that we do not have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As soon as we put a limit on our readiness for suffering, we will not be able to get very far.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a high demand, but this is what the Lord is after.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Anything short of this will not qualify us for His service.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not think that a mind to suffer is limited to just a little suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No, a mind to suffer has no limit; it is not even limited by death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Anything that comes short of this will not withstand any temptation from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death" Rev 12:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our conscience does not condemn us, if we declare our testimony of victory in the face of Satan, and if we love not our soul-life even unto death, his assaults against us will be futile.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He cannot deal with a person who does not seek to preserve his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are familiar with the story of Job Satan attacked Job because he scoffed at the idea that Job could possibly not have a desire to preserve his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He said to Jehovah, "Skin for skin!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Indeed all that a man has he will give for the sake of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But stretch forth Your hand, and touch his bone and his flesh; and he will surely curse You to Your face" Job 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Satan knew that he could have a way with Job if Job had the slightest love for his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The passage in Revelation shows that Satan cannot do anything about those who do not love their soul-life even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is where many of God's servants have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They love their own life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May I ask: Is the preservation of our lives more important or the preservation of the Lord's work more important?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Is our life more important or is our responsibility more important?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Is it the saving of souls that matters or is it the saving of our lives?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Which is more important, our own life or the church of God?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Is God's testimony on earth more important or is our own life?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No one who indulges in self-love can serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who are suffering may not be qualified to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only those who have a mind to suffer, who have an unlimited capacity to suffer, who will not love their soul-life even unto death, can serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today we have to consecrate ourselves once again to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We do not consecrate ourselves to suffering, but we are ready to sacrifice everything.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord may not want us to give up our life, but we should have the conviction that we will love not our soul-life even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Brothers and sisters, too many failures in the work have resulted from man's own laziness, self-protection, and self-preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must not think that the eyes of the world are blind or that the eyes of the brothers and sisters are blind.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we set out for our work, others will see whether we are fully consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we hold something back for ourselves and if we take the compromising way, others will see it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Brothers and sisters, when the Lord calls us, He wants us to give up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May the Lord be gracious to us, and may none of us treasure ourselves or love our own soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have to learn to not love or pity ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we do not take this way, our work will become very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The degree of our willingness to suffer determines the amount of spiritual work we will perform.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If our mind to suffer is limited, our spiritual work will be limited, our blessing to others will be limited, and the result of our work will be limited as well.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>No other measurement of God's blessing is as accurate as our willingness to accept sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If our mind has an unlimited capacity to suffer, we will know the boundless greatness of His blessing.</S>
