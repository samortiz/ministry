<div class='line'><b>1</b> Some, these days, would tell us that our Jesus is not food,</div>
<div class='line'>That we only need to know about Him and do good,</div>
<div class='line'>But we're glad to tell you brothers, it's just not that way-</div>
<div class='line'>Jesus is the bread of life; we eat Him every day.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>We love the church life,</div>
<div class='line'>eating, drinking, breathing Jesus.</div>
<div class='line'>taking in God's Word.</div>
<div class='line'>We love to hear those</div>
<div class='line'>"O Lord, Amen, Hallelujahs!"</div>
<div class='line'>We love the church life,</div>
<div class='line'>feasting with the Lord.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> When He fills our inward parts, we're never quite the same,</div>
<div class='line'>So much richness we can taste by calling on His name.</div>
<div class='line'>"Services" but once a week for us will never do.</div>
<div class='line'>Every day we need the fellowship to take us through.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> If these latter days and situations of the world</div>
<div class='line'>Make you feel that round a vicious circle you are swirled,</div>
<div class='line'>Then please listen closely to the things we have to say;</div>
<div class='line'>It may be that you will find with us a better way.</div>
