Living Water</h2><p>1)&#8220;Out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit [the inward Holy Spirit of life], whom those who believed in Him were about to receive&#8221; (John 7:38-39).<p>The Lord&#8217;s words here indicate to us that the Holy Spirit will flow out as the living water from within us. Surely this refers to the Holy Spirit as life within us, drunk by us as the living water to be our life supply. Therefore, the living water is also a symbol of the inward Spirit of life.<h2 class=head3>3. Wind</h2><p>1)&#8220;A rushing violent wind...and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Acts 2:2-4).<p> This is the disciples&#8217; receiving the Holy Spirit of power upon them on the day of Pentecost in the upper room in Jerusalem. This is not like the breath breathed from within the Lord into them on the day of resurrection, but a rushing violent wind blowing upon them from without, signifying the Holy Spirit of power. Wind is naturally powerful and signifies power. Therefore, wind here is a sign of the Holy Spirit being the outward Spirit of power and is different from breath.<h2 class=head3>4. Mantle</h2><p>1)&#8220;I am sending forth the promise [the outward Spirit of power] of My Father upon you...until you are clothed with power from on high&#8221; (Luke 24:49).<p>The Lord&#8217;s word here also shows us that we are to be clothed outwardly with the Holy Spirit of power, promised by the Father, as a mantle worn by us to be our power. This is typified by the mantle Elisha received from Elijah (2 Kings 2:13-14). Therefore, this mantle is also a sign of the outward Holy Spirit of power and is different from the living water. This mantle Spirit, like the uniform of a public servant, brings authority and is useful for us to execute God&#8217;s commission. The inward Spirit of life is the living water, which we can drink for our inward supply; the outward Holy Spirit of power is the mantle, which we can wear for our outward authority.<h2 class=head2>F. The Experiences of the Two Aspects</h2><h2 class=head3>1. That of the Lord Jesus</h2><p>1)&#8220;That which is begotten in her [Jesus] is of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Matt. 1:20).<p>The Lord Jesus was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit. The life within Him is altogether the element of the Holy Spirit.<p><B>2)&#8220;And having been baptized...the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him&#8221; (Matt. 3:16).</B><p>Although the Lord Jesus was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit, and the life within Him was totally the element of the Holy Spirit, He experienced the Holy Spirit coming upon Him to be His power to work for God only after He was baptized.<h2 class=head3>2. That of the Disciples</h2><p>1)&#8220;It was evening on that day, the first day of the week...Jesus came and stood in the midst...He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:19-22).<p>By the breath the Lord breathed into the disciples on the evening of the day of resurrection, the disciples received the Holy Spirit into them.<p><B>2)&#8220;And when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place...out of heaven like a rushing violent wind&#8221;; &#8220;...the Holy Spirit has come upon you&#8221; (Acts 2:1-4; 1:8).</B><p>Although the disciples had received the Holy Spirit into them on the evening of the day of resurrection, the Holy Spirit still came upon them on the day of Pentecost.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
