<h2 class=head2>Having an Average of One Out of Every Four Saints Go Out Door-knocking</h2><p>The second principle is that out of every four saints there should be one who goes out door-knocking. This does not refer to the door-knocking which is to be carried out by the full-timers; rather, this means that in the seven days of one week, one out of every four saints should set aside two hours to go out door-knocking. This does not require you to do a lot; you need to go only once a week. However, you must be persistent in this and do it every week. Unless you or a family member is ill and needs to rest or be cared for, you all should keep this principle and practice going out door-knocking for two hours every week.<p>Luke 9 says that when the Lord was calling people to follow Him, someone said to Him, “Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father.” The Lord said, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of God everywhere.” Another one said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first permit me to say farewell to those in my house.” The Lord said, “No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks behind is fit for the kingdom of God” (vv. 59-62). According to this portion of the Word, we can also say that no matter what happens in our homes, we should always adhere to the principle of spending two hours a week to go out door-knocking. There are no excuses; nothing is so important that it can keep us from going out. No matter how busy we are, we must go out for two hours a week. There are fifty-two weeks a year, and as long as we are able to go, then we should practice this principle every week without fail.<p>I am speaking this word not to the full-timers but to all the saints. We all have a desire to serve the Lord because we love Him. Now the Lord wants us to set apart two hours a week for Him, so how can we say that He is asking too much? There are one hundred sixty-eight hours in a week, and two hours is only about one percent. If we really love Him, how can we refuse? If we cannot do even this much, how can we be excused? Regardless of who you are or how busy you are, you should give the Lord two hours every week to do nothing else but go out door-knocking.<h2 class=head1>A WAY OF RECEIVING THE BLESSING</h2><p>Now I have no desire to speak any doctrines. I just want to promote the new way for the Lord’s recovery. The first point of the new way is that of the saints who regularly meet, one in twenty should be a full-timer, and the second point is that one in four should go out door-knocking for two hours every week. If a local church would be willing to practice these two principles, it will certainly be greatly blessed.<p>The full-timers should also go out door-knocking from Monday through Saturday for at least two or three hours a day. If a full-time serving one would be willing to do this, I believe that every week he would gain and baptize at least one person. In this way he would gain about fifty people in a year. At this rate the church in Taipei with its two hundred full-timers would gain ten thousand people in one year.<p>I hope that we all would be able to hear and receive this word. The two hundred full-timers supported by four thousand people should spend every day studying the truth, serving the church, and caring for the saints. In addition, they should set aside two or three hours every day to go out door-knocking, and each of these two hundred should be able to gain about fifty people a year. This means that these two hundred would bring in ten thousand people through door-knocking. This truly is a profitable matter.<p>This is the conclusion we drew from our practical research. If the Lord allows it, the Chinese Recovery Version of the New Testament will be finished next year, and then I will go to every continent to speak the same thing. On the one hand, I hate that I am so old now that I am not qualified to be a soldier, and on the other hand, I am certainly bearing too many burdens. Otherwise, I would definitely go out door-knocking every day.
