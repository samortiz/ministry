   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we do not see the mystery of Christ's redemptive work, we shall not know the significance of the blood and water flowing out from His side.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The flowing of the blood and water is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Blood is for redeeming, but water is for life-imparting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is mysterious because life-imparting is a mysterious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have pointed out, the Lord's death on the cross was likened to a grain of wheat falling into the earth to die in order to bring forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This aspect of Christ's death is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Another mysterious aspect of the Lord's death is referred to in John 3:14 and 15: "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the fulfillment of the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole by Moses Num 21:4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on their behalf for God's judgment so that by looking upon that brass serpent all might live.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That was the type.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus applied this type to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the fulfillment of the type of the brass serpent lifted up on a pole, the Lord was lifted up on the cross to deal with Satan, the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is certainly a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, the incarnation is a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ's deity is a mystery, and His becoming flesh is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could the very God become flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the Gospels record miracles done by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in Matthew, Mark, and Luke they are called miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the miracles in the Gospel of John are not called miracles; the Greek word is signs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, in Cana of Galilee the Lord changed water into wine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But John 2:11 says, "This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory, and His disciples believed in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A sign signifies something invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a symbol that points to a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the miracles in the Gospel of John, being signs, signify certain invisible mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every sign in this Gospel is a symbol of a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the Gospel of John is a book of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a book of mysteries, the Gospel of John is the story of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not merely the story of a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was the very God who lived in this Man who performed these miracles, these signs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we may say that the Gospel of John is the story of God in the Man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This God does many signs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever He does is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may know all the miracles recorded in this Gospel, but we may not have seen that these all are signs of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I point this out because we need to realize that the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is altogether a mysterious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have seen that the Gospel of John, along with his Epistles and Revelation, is a book of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Gospel speaks of the mystery of Christ's divine Person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John 1:14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we see three mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Word is a mystery, the flesh is a mystery, and even the tabernacle is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Word, the Logos, is a mystery to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In eternity Christ was the Logos, and in time this Logos became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to John 1:14, this flesh is a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All this is a mystery that is beyond our ability to comprehend fully.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes we say, according to the Bible, that we are the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that we are God's sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Lord's recovery, we would never refer to our meeting hall as a sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But we definitely have a sanctuary in the church life, for we, the believers in Christ, are God's sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No, we do not have a so-called sanctuary built of wood, steel, and stone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, we have a sanctuary built of the living members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Unbelievers are not able to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we tell them that we, the living members of Christ, are God's sanctuary, they would say, "What are you talking about?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I don't understand how you people can be a sanctuary."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The reason unbelievers cannot understand how we can be God's sanctuary is that this is a mystery.</S>
