<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF FORNICATION</h2><p>Now we need to consider what fornication is. Fornication is to have a husband and to submit yourself to another man. Many Christians today, perhaps including some of us, are committing fornication. We commit fornication when, on the one hand, we admit that Christ is our husband, while, on the other hand, we submit to so many other things. Submitting ourselves to anything other than Christ is fornication. If we have the light, the vision, we shall see that Christianity today is full of this kind of fornication. As a chaste wife, you should not submit to anyone other than your husband, and you should not receive anything from anyone else. To receive something from someone other than your husband is fornication. But look at today&rsquo;s Christianity! Week after week and day after day, Christians are receiving things other than Christ. We in the church life should be careful not to receive anything other than Christ. We should not receive teachings, doctrines, practices, or forms. To receive something other than Christ, even if that thing is good or even scriptural, is to commit spiritual fornication. We should receive only Christ and allow only Him to make us pregnant.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO PRODUCE THE MAN-CHILD</h2><p>Only by receiving Christ into our being can we bring forth the man-child. The man-child is formed wholly of the constituent of Christ. In order to produce the man-child, we must first be one with Christ and receive something of Him. When we receive something uniquely of Christ, we shall be made pregnant of Christ to bring forth the man-child. If you see this vision, you will feel sorrowful about the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity. Where is the man-child? Christianity has produced many things, but there is nearly no man-child. Because Christianity has been impregnated of things other than Christ, hardly anything that it brings forth is the man-child.</p><p>God does not intend for the woman to fight the dragon. God intends to use the man-child to fight against the dragon. The dragon is still active in the heavens because the man-child has not yet been brought forth. Now we can see that this life-study of Revelation is not accidental; it was planned and timed by God that we all might see that we must be the unique woman submitting ourselves only to Christ, not to anything or anyone else, and that we must only receive what is of Christ. When, as this woman, we receive something uniquely of Christ, the man-child will be brought forth.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE<br />BETWEEN THE WOMAN AND THE MAN-CHILD</h2><p>The man-child is the stronger part of the woman. On the one hand, we firstly must be the woman; on the other hand, we must also be the man-child. It is not adequate simply to be bright and heavenly. We must be fully constituted with the element of Christ. The difference between the woman and the man-child is this: not much of the element of Christ is constituted into the being of the woman, but the entire being of the man-child is saturated and permeated with the element of Christ. Hence, the man-child is the very constitution of Christ. How can this man-child be brought forth? He is brought forth by Christ&rsquo;s getting into part of the woman to constitute that part of her with all the rich element of Christ. Do not consider this merely as an interpretation, but apply it to your daily experience. Even if you submit yourselves to Christ and receive something of Him, you are still the woman and are not yet the man-child. You will not be strong until you have allowed the element of Christ to be worked into your being. The more the element of Christ is worked into you, the stronger you will become. This is the man-child.</p>
