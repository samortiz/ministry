   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PART ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AUTHORITY AND SUBMISSION CHAPTER ONE THE IMPORTANCE OF AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Rom 13:1-7; Heb 1:3; Isa 14:12-14; Matt 6:13; 26:62-64 THE THRONE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ESTABLISHED UPON AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's works issue from God's throne; God's throne is established upon authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All things have been created by the authority of God, and all laws on earth are held together through authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the Bible says that God upholds all things by the word, which is of His authority Heb 1:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not say that God upholds all things by His power.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God's authority represents God Himself; God's power only represents God's works.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is easy to be forgiven of sin against God's power, but it is not that easy to be forgiven of sin against God's authority, because sinning against God's authority is sinning against God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the whole universe only God is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All other authorities are appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nothing is greater than authority in the universe; nothing can surpass it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, if we want to serve God, we must know God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>SATAN'S BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan became Satan because he overstepped God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He wanted to compete with God and to stand in opposition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rebellion is the cause of the fall of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both Isaiah 14:12-15 and Ezekiel 28:13-17 speak of the transgression and the fall of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Isaiah 14 tells us that Satan violated God's authority, while Ezekiel 28 tells us that he violated God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Violating God's authority is a matter of rebellion; it is more serious than violating God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sin is a matter of conduct; it is easy to be forgiven of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But rebellion is a matter of principle; it is not easy to be forgiven of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Satan, in trying to set up his throne above that of God's, violated God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The principle of Satan is the principle of self-exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sin's coming into being was not the cause of Satan's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, Satan's rebellion against God's authority, for which he was condemned by God, subsequently gave rise to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, if we want to serve God, we can never violate the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To do so is to follow the principle of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can never preach the word of Christ under the principle of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a possibility in God's work that we can stand in principle on Satan's side, while we stand in doctrine on Christ's side.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the while, we may think that we are still doing the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a very evil thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Satan is not afraid of us preaching the words of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is only afraid of us submitting to the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our service to God can never be according to the principle of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once the principle of Christ comes, the principle of Satan has to go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even now Satan is still a usurper in the air; he will not be cast out until the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only when we wash ourselves spotlessly clean from the principle of Satan can we hope to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Lord's prayer in Matthew 6:9-13 there is the phrase, "And do not bring us into temptation."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Temptation speaks of Satan's work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is also the phrase, "But deliver us from the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This refers to Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Following this, the Lord said, "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the most important declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The kingdom is God's and so is the authority and the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Everything is God's. What sets us completely free from Satan is seeing this most precious thing the kingdom is God's. The administration of the whole universe is under God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For this reason we have to learn to submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one can steal God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Satan showed the Lord all the kingdoms of the earth, but the Lord said that all the kingdom of the heavens is God's. We need to see to whom authority ultimately belongs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we preach the gospel we are bringing people under the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are to establish God's authority on earth, is it then possible for us not to meet authority ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not, how can we deal with Satan?</S>
