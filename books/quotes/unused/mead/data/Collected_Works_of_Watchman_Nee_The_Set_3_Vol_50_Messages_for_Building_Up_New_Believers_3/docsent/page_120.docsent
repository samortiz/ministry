   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Church Recovering</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Universal Priesthood Again</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Right then a promise which had been set aside for fifteen hundred years was recovered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What the Israelites lost has been recovered by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The universal priesthood was lost to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament age, it is as if a voice from heaven bursts forth with the promise that the universal priesthood is with us once more.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the saved ones are called to be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>C. The Church Being a Kingdom of Priests</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same word can be found in Revelation 1:6, which says, "And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Originally, the whole nation of Israel were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Later, this changed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what about today?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today the church is a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What the Israelites lost in the presence of the golden calf, the church has fully regained through the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today the entire church has become priests.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's ordained kingdom of priests has now been fully restored.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. The Unique Occupation of a Christian</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Serving God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What God could not secure among the Israelites, He is now securing through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church today is the kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is a priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means that everyone who has tasted God's grace has only one occupation left, that of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have said this before to the young people: If a person is a doctor before he believes in the Lord, his occupation is medicine; if he is a nurse, his occupation is nursing; if he is a teacher, his occupation is teaching; if he is a farmer, his occupation is farming; if he is a businessman, his occupation is business.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the moment one becomes a Christian, his occupation completely changes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every Christian has only one occupation serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the time we were saved, we became priests to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Henceforth, we have to serve God in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is our lifelong spiritual goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every Christian has only one occupation, that of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Christian doctor can no longer expect to make a name for himself as a famous doctor; his practice as a doctor is only useful in sustaining his living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His real occupation is to be a priest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A professor or a teacher can no longer strive to be a famous or outstanding academician.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, he must now strive to be a proper priest before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His teaching becomes merely his vocation; his main occupation is to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Craftsmen, businessmen, farmers, and all the other professionals are no longer living for their own professions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is now only one profession for everyone, that of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>E. Only One Ambition Pleasing the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every brother and sister should set aside their old occupation on the day they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I hope that you will give up all your ambitions and aspirations the day you begin your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You should no longer aspire to be someone special.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You should no longer strive to be someone outstanding or distinguished in your field or line of occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You should learn from Paul, who had only one ambition to be well pleasing to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You should not have any ambition other than this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All worldly occupations should be put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You should no longer have any aspiration to be great or outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You should only aspire to serve the Lord in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>V. THE GLORY OF THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the early years of my Christian life, I always felt that it was a hard job to exhort young believers to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seemed that I had to try very hard to beckon, beg, and plead with others to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But God's view is totally different from ours.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God took the priesthood away from the Israelites when they sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In God's eyes service is a great privilege and a high honor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a man fails or backslides, God takes away the priesthood from him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has no intention to persuade or beg man to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He has no intention of seeking man's approval.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is man's glory, not God's, for him to be called to be God's priest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A. God Honoring Us by Calling Us to the Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who offered strange fire in the Old Testament were burned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some died when they entered the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Others died when they tried to offer sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God would not allow anyone except the priests to come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In God's eyes the priesthood is a trust He has placed upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is bestowing glory and honor to man and uplifting man when He calls him to the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A person would die if he volunteered to take up the priesthood according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Uzzah, who stretched out his own hand to steady the ark when it tilted, was immediately smitten to death.</S>
