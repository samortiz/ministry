	 <h2 class="head3">Gospel Outlines and How to Lead<br />
Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel</h2>
<p>Another book, <em>Gospel Outlines</em>, contains outlines on specific topics from Genesis through Revelation. This book is not an exposition of the Bible. It covers the Bible by topic, and contains two hundred sixty-six topics. There was an American brother who used to be a preacher with the Brethren assemblies and was an itinerant traveling evangelist. Many were saved through him, and he established at least ten Brethren assemblies. One day he called me and said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have written so many books, but I think three of them are the most valuable. If you agree, I hope to promote these three books in Christianity so that every believer will have a copy in their hands.&rdquo; One of the books was <em>Gospel Outlines.</em></p>
<p>In the outlines for the training on service held in 1953, there is a section related to preaching the gospel. Later we edited the outline into a small booklet entitled <em>How to Lead Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel</em> (see <em>Fellowship concerning the Urgent Need of the Vital Groups,</em> pp. 245-250). In this section, people are classified into twenty categories. The first category of people is those who live in sins, the second is those who are empty, and the third is those who are knowledgeable and rational. The other categories are the moral ones; the self-righteous ones; the atheists; the polytheists; those who are disgusted with the world; lovers of pleasures and vainglory; the realists; those who are ambitious and capable of great achievements; lovers of money; lovers of knowledge; lovers of fame, wealth, and position; the antagonists; the skeptics; those who are sad, pessimistic, and miserable; the stubborn ones; the churchgoers; and those who are indifferent. Once we know these different kinds of people, we can learn how to deal with them.</p>
<p>For instance, when speaking to a person who is living in sins, we need to touch the pains of sins and his conscience. However, we should not provoke him or cause him to dislike us; neither should we cause him to feel that we are condemning him. If we know that he is an alcoholic, we should not mention anything related to alcohol; neither should we mention stealing if we know that he steals. This requires wisdom. After reading the different categories, it is best to remember them and begin to practice.</p>
<p>The American brother whom we mentioned earlier was willing to promote the following three books in Christianity: <em>Gospel Outlines</em>, <em>How to Lead Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel,</em> and <em>The Economy of God.</em> This proves that believers have used these three books and know that they are very useful. <em>Gospel Outlines</em> may be more difficult to use, because it contains only topics and outlines. It does not have any explanation. Nevertheless, after reading the topics a person can still understand something related to the gospel. We may not be able to study all two hundred sixty-six topics, but we can at least study a few of them.</p>
<p>For example, the first topic is concerning the origin of the universe, which is God. This topic is worth studying, because God is the source of the universe. The second topic is concerning the meaning of the universe, which is also God, whereas the center of the universe, the third topic, is man. Then there is the evil one of the universe, who is the devil, Satan, and the tragedy of the universe, which is the fall of man. Following these, there is the gospel as the glad tidings of the universe, and Christ as the Savior of the universe. All these are worth studying.</p>
<p>Some of the topics are in groups. For example, there are a number of topics related to man, including the origin of man, the nature of man, the deeds of man, the need of man, the Savior of man, the salvation of man, the way of salvation for man, and the proof of man&rsquo;s salvation, as well as topics concerning after a man is saved. These are all matters related to man. The second group is related to sin, including the origin of sin&mdash;Satan, the one committing sin&mdash;Adam, the One who condemns sin&mdash;God, the One who redeems us from sin&mdash;Christ, the One who forgives sin&mdash;God, the one who is freed from sin&mdash;the believer, and the one who bears sin&mdash;Satan. The third group is concerning the main points of the gospel, including God, the devil, man, sin, the Savior, redemption, believing, and salvation. The fourth group has questions concerning the gospel. The fifth group is the chain of human life, the sixth group is the gospel of life, the seventh group is the meaning of life, and the eighth group concerns the Christian faith. We should make an effort to study these topics. Learning these topics can be likened to dying a piece of cloth. We should not put the cloth in the dye for a short time and then take it out immediately. Instead, we should keep the cloth in the dye for a long time so that the dye can saturate the cloth. We need to stay in the &ldquo;dye&rdquo; of the truth of the gospel for a long time so that we are saturated with the gospel. In this way we will be filled inwardly with the gospel, and what comes out of our mouth will also be the gospel. Then the preaching of the gospel will spontaneously be strong.</p>
