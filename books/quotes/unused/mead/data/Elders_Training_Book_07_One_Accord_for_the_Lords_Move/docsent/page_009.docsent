   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ASKING THE LORD TO BRING OUR ENTIRE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE LIGHT AND BEING DEALT WITH BY HIM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO BECOME A PERSON OF POWER,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>FULL OF THE SPIRIT WITHIN AND WITHOUT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not merely ask God to give you the power; the power is waiting for you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You need to be cleansed, dealt with, purified, chastened, and chastised by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No elder or any brother can deal with or purify your inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only the Lord Himself can deal with you directly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You need to give Him the way in your being every day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as we need to wash our hands frequently, we also need to be cleansed by the Lord frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To handle the gospel is a most holy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This could never be done by anyone whose hands are dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to come to the Lord and open our entire being to Him to be dealt with, to be enlightened, to be exposed, to be checked, and to be humbled.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The power comes from this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not merely pray for the power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The power is there to be appropriated by you, but who are you, what are you, and where are you?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may be dirty, never dealt with, proud, criticizing others, offending your wife, despising the elders, and rebelling against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may be feeble in this way, and yet still be zealous for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You cannot be a prevailing one to preach the gospel if you are this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are going to be a prevailing one, you need to go to the Lord every day to get yourself adjusted, cleansed, enlightened, exposed, and rebuked, not by man s words but by the Lord s Spirit directly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord has no chance to deal with you unless you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you pray, do not be occupied with your work or with other things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not even be occupied with gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have to keep yourself absolutely free and open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Leave yourself open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let Him come in for at least ten minutes to speak to you, to enlighten you, to point out to you all your shortcomings, sinfulness, evil, and impure thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ask Him to bring your entire being into the light for a full and utter exposure of your real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of prayer would make you prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You do not need to pretend that you are powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a purified and chastised person, when you open up your mouth, every word will be a word of power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever comes out of your mouth will be powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even your voice will be powerful because your person will be power.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will be the case because through your prayer you have been saturated by the cleansing One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The One who cleanses you is also the One who purifies and saturates you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a person saturated with the Lord, you will be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why a word spoken by one person is powerful, and the same word spoken by another means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Prayer makes your person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Prayer makes you another person, a person of power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such a person of prayer will be full of the Spirit within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you go to contact others, as a person who is full of power and full of the divine revelation of God s New Testament economy, the impact will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you go, you must have the unique one accord backing you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You should be one with the church, one with your co-workers, one with all the brothers, and one with all the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You should mean business with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you are such a person and if you are not carrying out something on your own and for yourself in the Lord s recovery, the impact will surely be there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>HAVING SOMETHING HIGH TO PRESENT TO PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I came to the United States when I was nearly sixty with little knowledge of English in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But I believe that since the first day I came to this country I was somewhat empowered, despite the fact that my English may not have been good and my speaking may not have been eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. L. Moody did not have a high education.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was helping his uncle in a shoe store when the Lord called him to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once after he preached to a large congregation, a learned person told him that his grammar was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moody frankly told that person to go to preach with his correct grammar and then see what would come out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The power, the impact, is not in the right grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is in what kind of person you are and what you present to people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>People do not want the proper grammar.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They want the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They want life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They want Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They want the reality of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The impact with me through the years is in prayer, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although I am not so skilled in singing, by the Lord s mercy, I have composed a number of good hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One of them, Hymn 501 in our hymnal, O glorious Christ, Savior mine, is actually much better in Chinese because nearly every line is poetic.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Recently, I was in a Lord s table meeting in a certain locality, and all the hymns sung in that meeting except for one were written by me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The one that was not written by me was the hymn with the chorus, One with Thee, one with Thee Hymns, 474 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This hymn was written altogether with my ministry by a sister who got much constituted with my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was another factor to convince me that we need a new hymnal, dropping all the substandard hymns we do not use out of our present hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Fifty years ago Hymn 226, written by the Brethren, We give Thee thanks, O Lord, was a treasure to me.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But today this treasure has lost its color and taste.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a very good hymn, but it is not that rich.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not as rich as Hymn 132 Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Verse six of this hymn is especially rich:</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>With the Glorified in heaven</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Is the Church identified;</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>By the Spirit of this Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Are His members edified.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>My point is that when we go out, we need to have something high to present to people.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why I am not bothered by the opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I consider myself as a seller of the oil Matt 25:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you want to buy the oil, come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>My English may not be eloquent or grammatical, but the oil and the divine riches are here in this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am not boasting, but I am challenging you to get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Take the unique way of prayer, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do not think of anything else and do not use any gimmicks.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Get yourself constituted, qualified, and equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then go out in your prayer with the Spirit presenting the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Many will get convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The seeking people are eager to listen to someone who can tell them what the reality of human life is.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is what they need, and this is what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need many saints to go and present the divine truths the Lord has shown us to the needy people.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Do not think of taking a way other than prayer, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Any other way will cause dissension and division.</S>
