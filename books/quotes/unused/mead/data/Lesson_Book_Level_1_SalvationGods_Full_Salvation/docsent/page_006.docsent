MAN PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After God created man, He planted a beautiful garden and put the man there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the garden there were many fruit trees good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the center of the garden was the tree of life and with it a river.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was in front of this tree that God put the man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, what was the most important need of man?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Did he need a job to earn money in order to eat?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No, all that he needed for living had been provided for him by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Did God tell the man to do good and to be a good person?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No, He simply created him and then put him in front of the tree of life in the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To realize what man needed most, you must remember what God s purpose was in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was not created to make a living or to be good and do good; He was created to express God in His image by being filled up with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So, what man needed the most was for God to be his life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>IN THE GARDEN S CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have heard about the garden of Eden, but do you know what was the most outstanding feature in the garden?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may think it was its beauty or pleasantness, but this was not so.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The most outstanding feature was the tree of life at the center.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This tree signified God as life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The garden of Eden was not just a beautiful place, but a place where man could receive God as life and be filled with God in order to fulfill God s eternal purpose and satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>LIFE NEEDED FOR GOD S EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though God had created man in His image and according to His likeness, it was impossible for this man to express God without receiving Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Simply to have the outward form of God s image and authority was not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For man to express God and represent Him, he needed God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without God s life, we are utterly unable and unqualified to express God and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A light bulb is a good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is made to express electricity by shining, but if electricity never comes into it, it can never fulfill its function.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is just the same with man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man is a light bulb to express God, the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But to do this, the divine electricity, God s life, must come into man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Though he has been made in God s image and likeness to express Him, man still needs God s life to come into him before he can truly express God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE TREE OF LIFE SIGNIFYING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now, let us turn to Genesis 2:9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After God created man, He did not tell man to do good or to do something for Him in order to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, He placed man in front of the tree of life so that man could partake of Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The way he would take God as life into him was by eating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The New Testament tells us that this tree of life signifies God incarnated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John 1:4 tells us that In Him was life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In John 14:6, the Lord Jesus said that He is the way, and the reality, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In John 10:10, He told us that He came that we may have life and may have it abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 6:57, the Lord Jesus told us to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These verses point out that Jesus Christ Himself is the life for man, as portrayed by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Isn t this wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus did not come to give us some laws by which we should live.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He didn t come to give us a better job, house or car.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, He came just to give Himself to us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>V. THE RIVER OF LIFE QUENCHING OUR THIRST</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the garden there was not only a tree, signifying Christ as our life, but also a river.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Genesis it does not say a river of life, but in Revelation 22:1 it says, And he showed me a river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This river is seen throughout the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It signifies God as the Spirit reaching us as life and quenching our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In John 7:37 the Lord Jesus said, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This verse shows that Jesus came to be life to man in the same way that water quenches our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes, you may feel that nothing is able to satisfy you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That was the case with the people in John 7 see John 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They did not know God s purpose in creating them, nor did they realize their need to take God into them as life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even though they had just finished a big feast which lasted all week, they were still hungry and thirsty for something more.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was then that Jesus offered Himself to them to be a satisfying drink, bringing God as life to them so that both they and God could be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today, God is still offering Himself to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all need to come to Him and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Questions When God put man in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden, what did this signify?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why can we say that man did not need to earn a living or do good to fulfill God s purpose in creating him?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Try to explain why man needs God s life as well as His image to be able to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You may use an illustration if you need to.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What verses in the New Testament show us that the Lord Jesus is the tree of life to man?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What does man need the most today?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How can we eat the tree of life and drink the river of life today?</S>
