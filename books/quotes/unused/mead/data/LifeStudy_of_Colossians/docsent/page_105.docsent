   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ROOTED IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:7 Paul speaks of being rooted in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are plants rooted in Christ as the real soil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the earth in which we grow.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, Christ is all that we need for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is our fertilizer, our water, and our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>MADE FULL IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2:10 Paul goes on to say that in Christ we are made full.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, I doubt that any one of us dares to say that we are full, for we do not yet have the full experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily, and we are made full in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In our experience, we need to receive Him, walk in Him, be rooted in Him, and then be made full in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I hope that in the church meetings there will be many testimonies of how we have been made full in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There should be testimonies of how we have been made full in knowledge, wisdom, patience, kindness, lowliness, humility, love, discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are short of such testimonies because we are short in our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Day by day we are not being made full in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of being full in so many things, we are short of those things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, instead of being full of discernment in handling situations, we are lacking in discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As you listen to the testimonies of the saints, you can realize that most of us are short in the daily experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many of us still do not realize adequately that the Christ we have received is the all-inclusive One in whom we should walk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if we walk in such a Christ, having been rooted in Him, we shall be made full in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have pointed out that Christ is the reality, the substance, of all shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Seeing this, we should no longer care for the shadows we should care for the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our concern should not be simply to become holy, spiritual, and victorious; it should be to possess and experience the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to look to the Lord for mercy and grace to experience such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CHRIST AS OUR LIFE AND</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AS THE CONSTITUENT OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In chapter three we see that Christ is our life and the constituent of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The new man, which is the church, the Body of Christ, is constituted of the Christ who is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He lives in us, and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apart from such a Christ, what else do we want?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I can testify that I want nothing other than the all-inclusive Christ who is my life and the constituent of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE ARBITRATING PEACE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 3:15 Paul says, Let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Ephesians 2 we are told that on the cross Christ has made peace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should allow this very peace to arbitrate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This implies that we set aside our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greeks must forget their philosophy, and the Jews must forget their observances.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead of paying attention to philosophy and observances, we should take heed to the indwelling peace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the cross, Christ nullified the ordinances and abolished the philosophical concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ abolished the differences among peoples in order to create in Himself the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The peace produced through the abolishing of cultural differences should now arbitrate in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should let this peace be the referee, the arbitrator, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the peace of Christ arbitrates in us, all opinions will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We expect that the churches in the Lord s recovery will gradually increase in number.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No doubt, people with different backgrounds will come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Different people have different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of arguing over these opinions, we should let the peace of Christ arbitrate in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us all say, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, I care not for my opinion or judgment; I care for Your peace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not for my preference.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I want Your peace to arbitrate in me, to rule in me, and to make all the decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE INDWELLING WORD OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 3:16 Paul continues, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to allow the word of Christ to inhabit us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not be filled with Jewish tradition or Greek philosophy, but with the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are containers of the word of Christ, not of philosophy or religion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to be emptied of all such things in order to be filled with the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in us and if we are filled with the word of Christ, we shall have the new man in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All the saints in all the churches throughout the Lord s recovery will be living Christ in the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One day the Christ who is our life will appear in glory, and we shall appear in glory with Him 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But today we need to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We care for Him as our life and as the constituent of the new man, not for our background, culture, opinion, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We want His peace to arbitrate in us and His word to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>ALL AND IN ALL</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have pointed out again and again that in the new man there is no room for Jews or Greeks, circumcision or uncircumcision, cultured or uncultured, slaves or masters 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the new man there is room only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, in the new man Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is every part of the new man, and He is in every part.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This should not simply be a teaching, but our experience in a practical way day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May we all have a full experience of the all-inclusive Christ, the Christ who is everything to us.</S>
