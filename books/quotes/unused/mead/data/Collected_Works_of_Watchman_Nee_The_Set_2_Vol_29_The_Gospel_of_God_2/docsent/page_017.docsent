   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE THINGS TO UNDERSTAND IN GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us spend some time to consider some portions of the Scriptures that seem to speak of perdition after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before this, we have to know a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, the Word of God has absolutely no conflict with itself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, God can never say that His sheep will never perish or lose their eternal life, and on the other hand, tell man that he will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man can say wrong things, but God's work is a work of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He can never say anything by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If it is so clear on the positive side, it can never be contradicting on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The things on the negative side must be concerned with other matters related to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, we have taken the time to identify these passages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among them we see both genuinely saved ones as well as false ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus had a false disciple, Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Peter was baptizing people, there was a person named Simon who might not have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul also met many false brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Peter said that there were many false prophets, and John said that many had departed from them and proved to not be of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, in the Bible, there are the genuinely saved ones and the nominally saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some are not saved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course they cannot pretend or cover up forever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we can clearly differentiate between these few kinds of people, the problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if you mix these different kinds of people together, it is like mixing the tares with the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The result will be much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Third, many places in the Bible speak of the discipline of Christians in this age and not of eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not think that because we are eternally saved, there is no such thing as discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Indeed, there is discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you fail and have become weak today, God will discipline you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is a difference between discipline and eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One cannot mix eternal perdition with discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many verses, which seem to speak of Christians being lost again, actually speak of Christians being disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only is there the question of discipline and the question of falsity, but also the question of the kingdom and of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These few things are fundamentally different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times, we apply words for the kingdom to the eternal age, and words concerning the reward to the subject of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Naturally, this will produce many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must realize that there is a difference between the kingdom and salvation, and there is a difference between eternal life and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way God will deal with us in the millennium is different from the way He will deal with us in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a difference in the way God deals with man in the restored world and in the new world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The millennium is related to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is related to our works and our walk after we have become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The millennial kingdom is for the purpose of judging our walk.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in eternity, in the new heaven and new earth, everything is free grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All who are thirsty may come and drink freely Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This word is spoken after the new heaven and the new earth have come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, in the Bible, free gift and the kingdom are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eternity and the kingdom are also two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One cannot put the two things together.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the coming millennial kingdom, God will reward man in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God will reward man with his rightful crown and glory based upon his works.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But as soon as the kingdom is over and the new heaven and new earth begin, everything becomes a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Everyone who trusts in the grace of the Lord Jesus will enter in. There will not be the question of work at all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One's personal walk is related to the question of reward, while salvation and justification for the sinner are related to the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must differentiate between these two things clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, when the Bible speaks of the loss in the kingdom, you might be thinking about the loss in eternity, and when God speaks of reward, you might be thinking about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is true that man's salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But before this eternal salvation is manifested, God will first manifest the matter of reward in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One cannot mix these two things together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In addition to these things, there is another matter that Protestantism has buried in the grave for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although some may feel that this is something new, actually it was recorded in the Bible long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Bible there are at least three things which must be distinguished one from another.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have just mentioned two of them, which are the discipline that a Christian receives in this age, and the loss of reward in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we fail, we will not only be disciplined today, but will lose the reward in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, there is still another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the kingdom, there is definite punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible is very clear concerning this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When a person believes in the Lord and is saved, it is true that the problem of salvation is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is also true that the questions concerning the new heaven and new earth and eternal salvation are settled.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if this one continues to sin and would not repent, he will not only be under God's government and discipline today and lose the reward in the kingdom, he will also suffer some definite punishment in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some have told us that to lose the reward is punishment enough.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the defeated ones will still be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible devotes much space to speak of this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Bible not only tells us that Christians may not receive the reward in the kingdom, it also tells us that if Christians sin and do not repent, they will receive very heavy punishment in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must distinguish this matter clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The question of eternal salvation must not be mixed with the question of nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The question of eternal salvation must not be mixed with the discipline of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The question of eternal salvation must not be mixed with the question of losing the reward in the kingdom, and it must also not be mixed with the question of punishment in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>One cannot put these four distinctions together and make "chop suey" out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If one does that, God's work will become a mixture of everything that does not resemble anything.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If God has made the distinctions, and we ignore the distinctions, we will end up with many unsolvable problems.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today, we will first take away these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We will put aside all the words in the Bible that speak of nominal Christians, the discipline of the believers, the loss of reward, and the punishment in the kingdom for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the next few messages, we will cover them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What we will talk about in this message are the verses apart from these four kinds of cases.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We will talk about the verses that seemingly speaks of perdition after salvation.</S>
