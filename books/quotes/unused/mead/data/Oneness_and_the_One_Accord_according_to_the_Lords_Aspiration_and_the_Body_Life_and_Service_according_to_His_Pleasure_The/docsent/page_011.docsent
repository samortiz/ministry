   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many Believers Being Baptized into One Body, Being Members in Particular</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, this Body of Christ is composed of all the regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 12 says that we were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body v. 13 and are members in particular v. 27 . As soon as we were baptized, we were brought into an organic union with the Triune God to become living members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, He has placed all the members in the Body even as He willed v. 18 . Each one of us members has our own place in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is assigned by God, and should be accepted by us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since such an assignment is according to God's will, every member is necessary v. 21 . Especially those members who are not comely are more necessary vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has not merely placed all the members in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He has even mingled them together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verses 24 and 25 say, "But God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked, that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to His will, God has placed and tempered us, the different members of Christ, together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is as if we have been married.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There can be no divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No matter how we feel, whether the situation is good or bad, easy or difficult, we all need more transformation to practice the Body life through the one Spirit so that every member will receive abundant honor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Being Members One of Another, Living and Expressing Christ Together</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The purpose of us believers being members one of another in the Body of Christ is that we would live Christ and express Him together Rom 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the New Testament, none of us believers can live and work alone apart from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our living and work must all be in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As members of the Body of Christ, we are not separate and complete individual units.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we should coordinate together to become the many parts of the one whole.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What the Lord wants is not individual members, but a whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, most Christians are negligent concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They think it is all right as long as they love and fear the Lord and preach the gospel to bring others to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But as far as the expression of the Lord's Body is concerned, this is not good at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to see that in the Lord's recovery, one great item is the recovery of the Lord's Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of our living and work must be in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not live Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we live Christ with all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way we will express Christ in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By ourselves, none of us is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the church as the Body that is the fullness of Christ and the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Growing into Christ, Being out from the Head, and Fitted, Knitted, Growing, and Building</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, all of us members have to hold to truth in love that we may grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things Eph 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through the love of Christ within us, we love Christ and the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this love we hold to the reality, which is to hold to Christ with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way we will have Christ increase in us in all things, and we will grow into the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word "Head" here indicates that our growth in Christ should be a growth as members in the Body under the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, our growth is not only in Christ but also in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we grow into the Head in this way, we can produce out from the Head many functions for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 4:16 tells us that out from the Head the whole Body is joined closely together through every joint of the rich supply and is knit together through the operation in measure of each one part to grow together and to build up itself in love so that Christ may have a full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every one of us as members of the Body of Christ has a measure through the growth in life and can function for the growth and building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
