   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 7:"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Pharisees were self-proclaimed adherents of fundamental doctrines; actually, they were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the other hand, the Sadducees did not believe in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both the traditionalists and the modernists were offsprings of vipers and would end up in the same hell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The self-proclaimed fundamentalists believed only in creeds; they did not know the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the traditionalists damage the church just as the modernists do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were not only old but also dead, and they really did not know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The heritage of traditionalism may not be dependable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 8:"Produce then fruit worthy of your repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a need to produce fruits of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 9:"And do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father; for I tell you that God is able, out of these stones, to raise up children to Abraham."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The drawing near of the kingdom of the heavens has nothing to do with the fact that the Jews are the children of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What they need is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only by repentance can they become associated with the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 10:"And already the axe is laid at the root of the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a test.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This does not mean that a person is required to have certain good behavior; rather, it means that his behavior should be worthy of his repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 11:"I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse mentions three kinds of baptism: 1 the baptism of water, 2 the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and 3 the baptism of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fire here refers to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the original language the conjunction "and" indicates that the two terms that are conjoined should be treated in the same manner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since "Holy Spirit" is interpreted literally, "fire" must also be interpreted literally.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John said that the Lord "will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire" because at that time two groups of people were standing before him: one group belonged to the Lord and the other was not truly seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John's baptism could not differentiate them, but the Holy Spirit and fire could.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matthew 3:12 categorizes people into wheat and chaff.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some think that "fire" refers to the tongues of fire at Pentecost Acts 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If so, then the mentioning of "the Holy Spirit and fire" in Matthew 3:11 would be redundant and meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 3:10, 11, and 12 fire is mentioned three times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since in the first time and third time "fire" refers to the fire of hell, how can "fire" in the second instance not refer to the fire of hell?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This shows that at the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord baptizes people in the Holy Spirit, and that at the end of the kingdom of the heavens, He will baptize people in fire 2 Thes 1:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 12:"Whose winnowing fan is in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Judea the threshing floor is slightly higher than the ordinary ground.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Jews used oxen to tread out the grain 1 Cor 9:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the treading, they used the winnowing fan to blow off the chaff.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A barn is not built in the field but near the house; hence, it signifies the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever the Bible mentions the harvest, it refers mainly to rapture and sometimes to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 13:"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The baptism of the Lord Jesus is not recorded in the Gospel of John, because there He is shown as God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the other three Gospels do have the record of the Lord's baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 14:"But John tried to prevent Him, saying, It is I who have need of being baptized by You, and You come to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only the Gospel of Matthew mentions John's preventing because Matthew shows that the Lord Jesus is the King.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 15:"But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then he permitted Him."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What does "righteousness" refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a sinner goes into the water, he confesses that he is a sinner and therefore needs to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Jordan River signifies the water of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By going into the water, a sinner acknowledges that he deserves to be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord did this so that there is the possibility for men to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He fulfilled God's righteousness through His death and resurrection so that sinners might be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Us" indicates that God is the Father of all the believers; the Lord included all the believers in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why was the Lord baptized right at the time that He began to work?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to show us that as soon as the Lord began His work, He stood in the position of crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In reality, He died and resurrected after He worked for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But He wanted us to see that all His work on earth was done by Him in the position of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, He was baptized beforehand as a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the one hand, this shows us that the Lord's work is a work of death and resurrection; this is the aspect of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the other hand, it shows us that all the Lord's work was done in the position of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is also the principle of spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Self has three aspects: 1 will, 2 power, and 3 glory; they should all be put in the position of death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 16: "And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This proves that baptism is by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"The heavens were opened."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is in line with the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once the heavens were opened, the Spirit of God descended.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>From this we see that the meaning of the kingdom of the heavens is none other than God and man having fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord's death and resurrection caused the heavens to open.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The heavens can open only for death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since the Lord's death and resurrection is a fact, it requires only our believing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, because it is also a principle, it requires also our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In mentioning the dove, the Bible refers to two things: 1 being gentle and 2 having eyes that can see only one thing at a time for the dove's eyes are single .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"The Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him" indicates that the Spirit of God descended upon the Lord to give Him power that He might do only one thing before God in His entire life, which was to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Verse 17:"And behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God so testified because 1 the Lord truly took the way of death and resurrection, and 2 God wanted to prove that the Lord went into the water for the sake of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At that time, all the people were baptized only because of their sins; therefore, the heavens were silent.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only the Lord was baptized for the sake of righteousness; therefore, the heavens testified.</S>
