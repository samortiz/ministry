   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN OPEN LETTER Issue No. 23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This issue of The Present Testimony is the first of this year.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are many reasons for the delay of the publication of this issue, but we praise God who has made it possible for us to now complete it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we looked at God's provision for The Present Testimony during the last year, we could not help but praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Year after year, the number of copies printed has increased we are now printing five thousand copies of each issue , and the expenses have increased also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, God has provided all our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is worthy of our trust.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The offerings of God's faithful stewards to Him, though small at times, has been a genuine touch of their love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praise God!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people have asked whether the content of The Present Testimony can be simplified so that it can reach the ordinary believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some have asked whether The Present Testimony can mention other particular truths.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some people have even mailed us some very good articles and asked if these can be published in The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For these reasons, I realize that God wants me to clarify the nature of The Present Testimony once again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I think that the readers who have been reading this magazine for several years will feel that the messages delivered in The Present Testimony are substantially different from other magazines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is even different from Notes on Scriptural Messages which is a magazine published by us for young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reason for this difference is that The Present Testimony has a specific goal, a specific nature, and a specific direction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We feel deeply that there is a great deal of literature that is very helpful to people, and we have no intention of discrediting their merits.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But God's church is lacking a special kind of magazine that emphasizes only spiritual principles, that does not mention anything but "Principles of Spiritual Life," so that it may provide a little light to those who are genuinely seeking progress in the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also have special conferences each year for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We admit that The Present Testimony is not for all believers; it is for those believers who have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If The Present Testimony falls into someone's hands who does not have a need or who does not feel a need, it will not mean much to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If, however, The Present Testimony falls into someone's hands who happens to have a need, he will feel that he has found his food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The purpose of The Present Testimony is to meet a need; therefore, it will only help those who have the need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people have told us that at first they did not think too much of it, but after a period of time when God began to deal with them, they realized that The Present Testimony had its special usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have paid careful attention to this special nature ever since we published the old edition of The Present Testimony in 1923.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have even paid more specific attention to this point since we started the new edition of The Present Testimony in 1928.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is God's commission to us, and we hope in the future that we can be faithful to this commission and not change for any reason.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May God open our eyes to see that some truths are different from other truths.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise God that more than a few people have already seen this difference.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peace be with you all!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A household slave of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May 1932</S>
