   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because our situation was miserable and could not match God's grace, Christ not only took the step of incarnation to bring God as grace to us, but He also took the further step of death and resurrection in order to become the sure mercies to us in resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The divine economy and the divine dispensing in the promises of the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David have a threefold purpose: first, to destroy Satan and to save us from sin and death; second, to cause us to inherit the consummated Triune God as our blessing and inheritance; and third, to cause us to share Christ's kingship.</S>
