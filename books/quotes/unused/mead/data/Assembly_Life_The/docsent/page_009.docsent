   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Question: Can elders be elected by the believers?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Answer: No. Elders cannot be elected, because they are appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Presently, they are appointed by those who are doing the work of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible never uses the method of election.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only once in Acts is the word appoint used; it is used in the appointment of the first seven deacons 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, these deacons were first tested by the apostles and then appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Question: There are so many pastors in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can it be possible that not one of them is a genuine pastor?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Answer: As far as their ordination is concerned, no human- ordained pastor is a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As far as their gifts are concerned, it is possible that among those who are ordained by men, some have the gift of pastoring.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one can become a pastor through human examination, graduation from seminaries, ordination, or invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There has never been such a pastor in history.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he is truly a pastor, he must have received the gift of pastoring from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Question: How does the pastoral gift build the church?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Answer: The word pastor has been used only once in Ephesians 4 according to the Chinese Union Version Bible .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other passages, the word is translated shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The words pastor and shepherd are the same word in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The meaning of this word is to feed and guard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who are given the gift of pastoring should be able to lead and feed the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They should be able to lead others to grow step by step, discuss and study the Bible with others, and pray with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An evangelist is one who leads others to salvation and brings in men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A teacher is one who can release the truth and make others understand and see the truth in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A pastor or shepherd is one who leads others to advance; he does not necessarily have to be able to preach, though some are indeed able to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The function of the pastors is to feed the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Question: Can a woman have the pastoral gift?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Answer: Gifts are given without distinction of sex.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A woman can also have the pastoral gift.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The daughters of Philip had the gift of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Question: Can sisters testify and preach the gospel to unbelieving men?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Answer: The Bible has not clearly said no to this, but neither has the Bible encouraged it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no clear pattern in the Bible for us to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Personally, I think that if the sisters do anything beyond their covered position, they have gone beyond their limit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The covering that I am speaking of does not refer only to a piece of cloth on the head which is also an important sign but to the hidden and submissive position which God has allotted them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even brothers should have their heads covered before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The brothers cover their head under Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is the head of everyone, while the man is the head of the woman 1 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, a woman has two heads.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, a woman covers her head in Christ and, on the other hand, she covers her head through the man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The covering on a woman s head symbolizes her submission under the authority of the brothers and her not acting in an independent way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The sisters can do many good and precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But they have to take a few brothers as their covering so that both glory and shame will fall on these brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, it is improper for sisters to go to a place to do some pioneering work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A certain Western magazine once reported the words of a sister: I used to think that I had to do everything by myself and that I had to charge forward alone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I became sick and returned to my home country, I discovered that everything I had done was wrong, and I confessed my mistakes to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people think that since Deborah was raised up from the Israelites, there could be one today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But we have to remember that not every Israelite woman was a Deborah!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, even Deborah took Barak as her head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All genuine women want to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All genuine women honor what God has done, and they honor the place and order that God has placed them in. Because I am not a sister, it is somewhat difficult for me to say these words.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If I were a sister, I would be more free to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sisters should always stand in a covered position.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This does not mean that sisters should not work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It merely means that God has appointed the brothers to be the protector of the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The ones who assume the headship should be the brothers; all the glory and shame should go to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not mean that the brothers covet the sisters glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather it means that the brothers protect the sisters and maintain the order God has established.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is a woman s nature to stand in a non-prominent position.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why Paul reminded the women that their nature tells them this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a wife sits in the place of a husband and becomes the husband s head in a family, how can that family stand?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It will surely not stand.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a church acts this way, will it still be a church?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The virtuous woman recorded in Proverbs labors, works, and hopes that her husband receives the glory in the gate of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The most precious thing is to be submissive to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The relationship between a servant and his master, a child and his parents, a wife and her husband, a citizen and his country, and a woman and a man should be one of submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God pays much attention to the question of authority, while Satan pays much attention to power.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If a man only asks if a thing can be done and does not ask if a thing should be done, he has fallen already.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, every sister should stand in the position of submission to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The question of authority is the greatest and most crucial one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Unfortunately, it has produced little effect on the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, according to the light of the Bible, sisters should not open their mouth in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If they want to testify or preach the gospel to individual men or to groups of men, they should do it in a covered position.</S>
