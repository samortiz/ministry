<h2 class="head2">Training on the Study of the Bible</h2><p>We want to implement the following in the training for the study of the Bible: We will ask ten brothers to help the saints study the Bible. This does not mean that these ten are experts on the Bible. They are merely guides to lead the others into the right path. If anyone wants to dig deeper, they have to spend more time to study by themselves. We will first study Romans. We can use such commentaries as those by Moule, Darby, F. G. Grant, and F. L. Godet. We can also use Conybeare's paraphrase translation and writings by Kelly. We should also spend time to study the Interlinear Greek New Testament. These ten brothers should first study carefully at home. They can read through Romans in half an hour. The first time I studied Romans, I spent fifty-seven hours on it. Some may think that it is a waste of time to read through the whole book of Romans in one sitting, but I can only say that there are more words in a day's newspaper than in the entire book of Romans, yet many people can read through a newspaper in one sitting. Therefore, we should not complain about finishing Romans in one sitting.</p><p>When we come together, the first thing we should do is study the meaning of the words in the text. One of the ten should be designated to study the English translations. The best version to use is the Revised Version. Do not use the King James Version. Next consult the Interlinear Greek New Testament and study the text word by word. We can also study the writings of Philip Schaff, the Greek concordance of Alfred Schmoller, and the Englishman's Greek Concordance of the New Testament. This will help us to rightly divide the truth. Never base a message on a word or expression which Paul did not use in the original language. If we do, we will twist the word as Peter said and bring destruction upon ourselves (2 Pet. 3:16).</p><p>The best English reference is Dean Alford's Greek New Testament. There is a branch of research called "low criticism," which is somewhat similar to the textual research on Chinese classics that was prevalent during the Ming and Ching Dynasties. This method takes every word of the Bible and analyzes it carefully according to the text. The best work in this field was done by Alford. His writing can be considered the representative in the field.</p><p>If we have all these tools with us, we are quite complete as far as reference material is concerned. In the course of our study, we should spend much time discussing and fellowshipping among ourselves before making the appropriate judgments. We should not think that we can make proper judgments as long as we understand the original language and the meanings of the words. Proper judgment depends on the amount of light and revelation we receive from God. In this respect we must all humble ourselves and learn. Like Paul, we should say that we have not yet come to know as we ought to know (1 Cor. 8:2).</p><p>In my early days in Foochow, I studied the Bible every morning with over forty young brothers. We spent three and a half hours each day but sometimes covered only two verses. Three or four were seminary students. After this kind of study, they began to know what the Bible is all about, and they readily admitted that they still had a long way to go.</p><p>Here we are asking ten brothers to lead others to study the Bible. These ten will have to spend more time to study and fellowship. They can neither be ignorant nor proud. They should not think that they only need direct fellowship with the Lord. Our head and feet do not have direct communication with each other; they communicate through the other members. If we are a foot, we should not try to link up with the head directly. Instead we should learn to be restricted and learn to accept others' judgment. The church is the Body of Christ. Some of us may not need to read one reference book at all, while another may concentrate on just one reference book. We have to fellowship no matter what we do, and we have to coordinate together. Paul said that we should not despise prophecies (1 Thes. 5:20). This means that we have to respect the revelations that others have received. We have to honor the light that others have obtained.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Training to Meet the Need</h2><p>From the beginning I have said that the ones who migrate have to be very strong. This is more serious than fighting a warfare. It would be terrible if we gave them a reed instead of arms for battle. We can only meet the need by going through strict training and by being equipped with the proper provisions. The leading brothers must exercise vigilance over the whole flock. We must equip them with the best supplies. We must study the Bible seriously according to the above method. We have to dig into a few reference books before we can understand what studying the Bible really means and before we can train the other brothers and sisters to study in the same way.</p>
