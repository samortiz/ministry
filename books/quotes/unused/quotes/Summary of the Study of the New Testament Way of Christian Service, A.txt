We knocked on the doors of half a million homes in Taipei, and we baptized approximately thirty-eight thousand people
In these recent years, the Lord has particularly impressed us with the priesthood of the gospel of God in the New Testament
All the New Testament believers are priests, and the New Testament priests are the priests of the gospel of God
It was not until recently that the Lord showed us the main offerings which the New Testament priests offer to God
The fourth item in the practice of the Lord's advanced recovery today is the practice of prophesying in the church meetings
The church meeting in mutuality with all speaking for building up was seen by Brother Watchman Nee more than fifty years ago
Now the Lord is bringing us into the practice of having church meetings with all prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ
They are the scriptural, God-ordained way of Christian service for the organic building up of the Body of Christ
We have already spoken much concerning the practice of the Lords advanced recovery today and we have printed much literature on this subject
What we will present in this small book is a summary of what we have received as a result of our four and a half year study
In the advance of the Lord's recovery today, we need to be brought into the practice of the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God
The first item of this gospel is the incarnation of the Triune God to be a man, and the last item is the New Jerusalem
He visited Zaccheus with His dynamic salvation , and He visited the Samaritan woman to bring her the living water
He sent the twelve to go to the cities and villages to visit the lost sheep of the house of Israel and bring them peace
We should go to seek out sinners by visiting them and meeting with them in their homes that they may be saved to become new believers
After a period of time, we may not have the way to take two of them on with the Lord due to certain circumstances
To cherish the children is to make them happy by nurturing them with tender love and fostering them with tender care
At the time when the new believers were saved, we presented them to God as spiritual sacrifices, the sacrifices of the gospel
We need to function in this way by taking the Apostle Paul as a pattern until we present every one of them to God full-grown in Christ
The Body is built up by itself through all the members-the supplying joints and the operating parts-functioning
The real building up of the Body is by all the saints functioning either as supplying joints or as operating parts
The proper church meetings are meetings of mutuality in which all the saints come with something to prophesy, to speak for the Lord
When we come to the meeting we must be exercised to prophesy because we owe something to God to the Lords salvation and to the divine life
It is excelling in convicting people, exposing people's real condition, and showing people their spiritual need
We also need to learn to prophesy by being perfected by the gifted ones and by practice, rejecting any despising of prophesying
We have been accustomed to having big meetings with one speaker who may be gifted, eloquent, knowledgeable, rich, living, and even exciting
We liked having such a brother and considered it a blessing to have someone to give us something exciting every Lord's Day
They feel that we are all suffering, coming to the meeting without a big speaker, knowing that we all have to be the speakers
It would be wonderful if all the churches had fully entered into the four practices of the present advance of the Lord's recovery
There may be few such churches on the earth today because many of us have been in the old practice and have become used to it
Even though the leading ones in the churches may agree with these four practices, they may feel that it is difficult to practice them
For now some localities may still need a meeting in the traditional way with one person speaking and the rest listening
We have to admit that we are in a situation which is not up to the standard of the divine revelation, at the level of God's ordination
If the church in your locality is not ready to practice these four practices you should not push the saints condemn them or criticize them
Perhaps a church would only carry out the first two practices, not being ready to practice the perfecting of the saints and the prophesying
After some are saved, keep going to their homes to have home meetings with them to build them up and raise them up
They would like to see you bring people to be saved and then brought into the church and established for the church life
One church may practice all the four practices of the Lord's recovery, while another church may only practice one
Now the Lord wants us to come into an age in which every item of our practice is according to God's ordination, the divine revelation
We all have to pray toward this goal, and we all have to do our best to cooperate with the Lord and to coordinate together step by step
We needed to see how to serve God, how to meet together, how to function, how to carry out the work, and how to preach the gospel
They saw the truth concerning such things as baptism by immersion and the administration of the presbytery, the eldership, in the church
A big advance concerning the practice of the church life was with Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren in the eighteenth century
In the twentieth century, the Lord brought us in mainland China into His recovery through Brother Watchman Nee
He took the lead to read about the history of the church and to read the main writings of the seeking ones throughout the centuries
He saw the boundary of the local church and the local ground of the church to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ
According to this revelation, when the whole church comes together, each saint should have something to share, so 'each one has'
Such a traditional way of meeting has become the major meeting and the major structure of the practice of Christianity
Brother Nee saw that this meeting was not scriptural, and he said that it was according to the customs of the nations
The practice of preaching the gospel in the New Testament is a practice of visiting people, but our practice was different from this
When we began to practice visiting people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, the results confirmed the Lord's way
Ephesians 4 does not say that these gifted persons are for doing the particular work in their respective lines
There is the full possibility for the attendants of a church meeting to prophesy one by one because all of us have the divine life
Human beings can learn a language because in the nature of the human life there is the ability to learn a language
If we give up this obligation, our attitude is that we need a 'clergyman' to replace us so that he can speak to us all the time
The sinners saved through our gospel preaching are the main offerings we should offer to God in His New Testament economy
The gospel of God regenerates sinners, making them the members of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ
As the New Testament priests we are handling the gospel of God to save sinners to raise them up and to perfect them until they can prophesy
Ephesians 4 refers to the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the New Testament ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ
Strictly speaking, there has been very little building up among us because we are short of the perfecting of the saints and the prophesying
The conclusion of the Old Testament priesthood and the beginning of the New Testament priesthood were in John the Baptist
Paul as a pattern of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God also offered the saved sinners to God as spiritual sacrifices
Sooner or later, some of the seeking saints will pick up some copies of these books and practice what has been released in them
As we care for them for six months to a year, they will be ready to present themselves as a living sacrifice to God as Romans 12:1 instructs
We hope that at least about one-third of the saints in the church would practice this kind of gospel visitation
The leading brothers should pray, 'Lord, raise up at least thirty-five of the saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel
The four major steps in the advance of the Lord's recovery today are workable, but they require our constant and regular labor
The governing principle of the Lord's ordained way is that it affords equal opportunity to all the members of the Body of Christ
The traditional way robs the saints of their opportunity to function and gives this opportunity to a small clerical class
According to the old, traditional way, the believers seemingly have little ability because they are not allowed to participate in anything
We have to help others to enter into what we have learned to bring them into functioning with equal opportunity
We may think that serving God, preaching the gospel, or functioning to give a testimony are things that we can do easily and naturally
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship'
The Lord Jesus adjusted her by saying that the worship the Father God seeks after is absolutely different from this
Today by His mercy and under His enlightenment, we can say that we are clear what it means to worship God in our spirit
In the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5 through 7, the first blessing is the blessing of being poor in spirit
He told us that if we are going to be blessed with the kingdom of the heavens, we first have to empty ourselves in our spirit
We are empty, and the Spirit of truth can come in to unveil the things concerning this wonderful person, Christ, in an absolutely new way
Whenever we talk about the things concerning God, we have many opinions, concepts, and views which are mostly according to tradition
When we talk about how to meet, we may have the concept that we need to be reverent and exercise a certain amount of fear toward God
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
If we are going to carry out God's ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people, we have to learn to do it as priests
He is one who can teach people and tell people about God, about what God wants, and about what a man should be before God
As such priests, they should always live a life of being one with God to bring God to man and to bring man back to God
In the New Testament, God wants the New Testament priests to offer saved sinners to Him as parts of the corporate Christ
The Old Testament priests offered the types of Christ, but the New Testament priests offer the parts of Christ
Peter said here that we are living stones being built up into a spiritual house, and this built up spiritual house is the priesthood
Through God's virtues we were saved in a subjective way, being brought out of darkness into His marvelous light
We are priests handling God's gospel, which includes everything from the incarnation of the Triune God to the New Jerusalem
Most of us were just the helpers, the Levitical serving ones, who served one great priest, a gifted evangelist
We can use a few verses to impress these new ones that today Christ is the Spirit and that now they have Christ within them, in their spirit
Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 say that since we are so full, we will sing and speak in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs
With those who have recently been baptized, we should use the time to impress them that the Lord Jesus is in them
The husband would make the decision to smash this idol into pieces, and we would encourage him to do so right away
The fellowship brings in the interceding, the interceding brings in the mutual care, and the mutual care brings in the practical shepherding
Someone may ask what the cross is, and a young brother who was saved just three weeks ago can answer this question
Another brother may say, 'When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was crucified not only for our sins but also for us'
If a new believer is brought into a group meeting, and he attends over forty-five group meetings a year, he will learn much truth
When Paul wrote this, he was talking to the Hebrew brothers and telling them not to forsake their own meeting, their Christian meeting
If someone were charged to be the leader of a group meeting, he would have to prepare a teaching to give, and he would be overburdened
All the riches of the attending members will come out in the group meetings, and these are the riches of the Body of Christ
If a certain brother were charged to take care of a group meeting, probably very few of the saints in the group would pray for that meeting
They would not bear the burden for the meeting because they know that a brother has been assigned to care for it
The Spirit knows what to cover, and He can be one with the attendants in the meeting to raise the appropriate questions
In the old way the riches within only one brother are dug out but in the Godordained way everyone has an opportunity to pour out his riches
He can tell this new brother to enlarge and uplift what he has been speaking in the group meeting for a prophecy in the Lord's Day meeting
His speaking will be prophesying with the riches of his experience of Christ or with the riches of his knowledge concerning Christ
They can take some time with the saints after the meeting on the Lord's Day to give them some helpful adjustments
One thing we need to remember for all of our meetings is that we need to be 'crazy' with and in the Spirit and the word
They may be concerned that nothing will come out if we begin to meet in mutuality and that this will result in a drop in attendance
The Bible has not been opened up among them, and they have very few books to help them get into the riches of the Bible
You can not only perfect them in the meetings but also perfect them outside the meetings by going to be with them
Paul said in Acts 20 that he taught the saints publicly and from house to house and that he admonished each one with tears
In this producing way, we all learn to do something and to share something, and we will fully use our capacity to function
