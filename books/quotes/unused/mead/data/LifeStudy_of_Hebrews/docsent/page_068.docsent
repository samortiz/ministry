   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE REMAINING SABBATH REST 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we are to understand any major aspect of this revelation, we must take care of the governing principles established and revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The governing principle of the Bible as a whole is that God in eternity past made a purpose, a plan, which was to express Himself with His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This plan, God s eternal purpose, is thoroughly revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Genesis 1 and 2 we see that man is the center of God s created universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God created the heavens, the earth, and millions of other items, the central item is man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God made man in a very specific way, forming him out of the earth Gen 2:7 and in His own image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, man, a single entity, bears two things: the earth and the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In substance man is earthly, but in expression he is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this one entity, man, we see a wonderful principle one creature bearing the earthly substance and the divine image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When man expressed God s image and exercised His authority in His dominion, God was at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we have seen in previous messages, this is the significance of the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was the situation at the very beginning of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we go to the end of the Bible, we see the consummation: the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the new heaven and new earth, the earth will be more useful than heaven because the New Jerusalem will be on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read Revelation carefully, we shall see that the New Jerusalem is not a physical building, but a living composition composed of living persons, such as the twelve Apostles of the Lamb and the twelve tribes of Israel Rev 21:12, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The city of New Jerusalem will bear the appearance of God and express Him in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, God s throne will be in that city, and God s authority will be fully exercised there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the eternal kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in the New Jerusalem God will have complete rest and obtain His eternal Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This matter is the governing principle of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>XIX.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE THREE PERIODS OF THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are to know the Bible, we need to have an overall view of it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you realize that the universe is composed of three periods?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first period was the time before Adam, the period that is called the pre-Adamic age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we saw in our Life-Study of Genesis, before Adam was created the universe was already in existence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one can tell how long that first period of time was.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second period of the universe extends from Genesis 1:2 through the end of the coming millennium, from the time of the creation of Adam until the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This period of time is quite short, perhaps not more than seven thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we may think that this is a long time, in God s eyes seven thousand years are the equivalent of seven days, for to Him a thousand years are as one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Following this second period, there will be the third period of the universe the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That period will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to know the Bible thoroughly, we must understand these three periods of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The first period of the universe was the period of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God created, Satan damaged, and God came in to judge the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Genesis 1:2 we have the start of God s re-creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Strictly speaking, only verse 1 of Genesis refers to God s creation, for verse 2 is the beginning of God s re-creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Within God s re-creation there was further creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man, for instance, was not a re-creation but a creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the time of God s re-creation until the full completion of His purpose will be a period of approximately seven thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since it is during this span of time that God accomplishes His eternal purpose, we may call this the period of accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The period of accomplishment began with the creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man was God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s re-creation only recovered the fallen universe back to a condition suitable for man s creation and existence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second coming of the Lord Jesus will not end the period of accomplishment, because the old heaven and old earth will continue for another thousand years after the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those one thousand years will be a continuation of the period of accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord s second coming is even a further step in the accomplishment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, God s accomplishment of His purpose began with the creation of man and will be completed not at the time of the Lord s second coming but at the end of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After the period of accomplishment, the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem will come.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That will be the period of the eternal Sabbath, the time of the complete Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The eternal period in the future will be an unending Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our Father, our Savior, and all the redeemed ones will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is our destiny, our future.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our future is the eternal Sabbath where our Father, our Savior, and all of us will be at rest for eternity.</S>
