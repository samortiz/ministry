(2:18)<p>We both have access unto the Father not by being inspired by the Spirit but by being in one Spirit. The Jews and the Gentiles could not be one; there was a solid wall between them. However, the Spirit is in the Jewish brothers, and the same Spirit is also in the Gentile brothers. Thus, in one Spirit they have become one. Hence, this Spirit is the uniting Spirit.<p>Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. (4:3)<p>This oneness is in the Spirit, and this Spirit is the oneness. The work He is doing in us is a revealing work and a uniting work. The more we debate about doctrine, the more we are separated; the more we debate, the greater the distance between us. However, if we would turn to our spirit, the result will be oneness. The fluorescent lamps in a room are separated outwardly, but they are joined in the electrical current to become one entity. Likewise, in ourselves you are you, and I am I; however, in the Spirit we are one.<h2 class=head1>THE BUILDING SPIRIT</h2><p>In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. (2:22)<p>God&#8217;s dwelling place, God&#8217;s building, is built by the Spirit in our spirit. When we live in this Spirit, we have revelation; when we live in this Spirit, we keep the oneness; and when we live in this Spirit, we are built together.<p>One Body and one Spirit. (4:4a)<p>The Spirit is in the Body; hence, there is one Body and there is one Spirit. If we do not live in the Spirit, building becomes a mere doctrine, and so does coordination. Both the building and the coordination are in the Spirit. It is for this reason that we need to learn to live in the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE STRENGTHENING SPIRIT</h2><p>That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man. (3:16)<p>The inner man is our new man, our regenerated spirit, whereas the outer man is our soul. Our self is our soul; the Lord is in our spirit. Our soul is the outer man; our spirit is the inner man. Many saved ones are very strong in their soul but very weak in their spirit. In other words, their outer man is strong, but their inner man is weak. Hence, they do not have much experience of the Lord. For this reason the apostle Paul prayed that God would strengthen our spirit with His Spirit to make our spirit strong. Hence, the Spirit who is in us is the strengthening Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE RENEWING SPIRIT</h2><p>And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind. (4:23)<p>At this stage the Spirit is no longer only in our spirit but has spread into our mind to become the spirit of the mind. For building we need transformation, and for transformation we need renewing. Romans 12 also refers to our being transformed by the renewing of the mind. How do we have this transformation by renewing? It is by having the Spirit in our mind. Unless the Spirit spreads to our mind, we cannot be renewed. Therefore, the Spirit must spread. If we frustrate the Spirit, there is no possibility for us to be transformed. God must spread to our mind so that our mind can become the spirit of the mind. It is in the spirit of the mind that we are renewed.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
