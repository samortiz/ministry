   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRINCIPLE OF EVERYONE SERVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have said enough concerning the practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You have to be clear before God about this principle that all the brothers and sisters must have spiritual service as well as practical service.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It does not matter how much everyone can do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I expect that everyone will work and do his best.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If this matter can be properly arranged, the church will be able to progress step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers, I say again that you must realize that the responsibility upon you is very great and that the things in your hands will keep you very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to work to such an extent that you bring all the brothers to the same condition that you are in. When all the brothers come and serve together, the church in that locality will have a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When others see this, they will know the church is in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everyone works, everyone shares in the practical affairs, and everyone participates in the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CAUSING ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TO DO BUSINESS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would like to speak to the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have a natural habit of using only the two-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The history of the church has always been like this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The five-talented ones can advance by themselves; there is no need to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as for the one-talented ones, it is really hard to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A word or two to them and they bury their talent again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The two-talented ones are the most available ones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have some ability, they can do things well, and they do not bury their talents.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if you can use only the two-talented ones and cannot use the one-talented ones in every place, you have failed completely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have said this in Foochow, I have said this in Shanghai, and I will say it again today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is all the one-talented ones coming forth to partake of the church service on the practical side and on the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You cannot shake your head and say, This one is useless, and that one is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you say that this one is useless and that one is useless, the church is finished and you fail completely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you think someone is useless, he will really be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can tell him that according to himself he is indeed useless, but the Lord has given him one talent, and He wants all the one-talented ones to go out and do business.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord can use them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you cannot use the one-talented ones, it proves that before the Lord you cannot be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You have to use all those brothers and sisters who are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the job of the brothers who are workers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They must not only use the useful brothers and sisters but also make the useless brothers and sisters useful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The basic principle is that the Lord has never given less than one talent to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Lord s house there is not one servant without a gift; everyone has at least one talent and cannot have less than one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No one can excuse himself by saying that the Lord has not given him a talent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I would like you to realize that all of God s children are servants before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they are children, they are servants.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, if they are members, they have a gift; if they are members, they are ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we think that there is someone whom the Lord cannot use, we do not know the grace of God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must know the grace of God so thoroughly that when God calls someone His servant, we would never stand up to say that he is not.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today if you did the choosing, perhaps you would pick only three or four persons from the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But God says that all are servants.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since God says this, we must let them serve.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, from now on whether or not we have a way in our work and whether or not the way will succeed depend upon what we can say about our work before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Are there only some who are working?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are only some specially gifted ones doing the work?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Or do all the Lord s servants participate in the service, and is the whole church serving?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the entire problem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If this problem cannot be solved, we have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all must learn this one thing: Only when every member functions is there the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only when every member functions is that the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our problem today is that we have inherited the priestly system of Roman Catholicism and the pastoral system of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are careless at the present time, there will also appear a certain kind of mediatorial system among us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We will be the only ones who take care of the matters in God s service.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Merely preaching the Body of Christ is useless; we must let it work and show forth its functions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since it is the Body of Christ, we need not fear that it will lack the functions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since it is the Body of Christ, we can place our faith in it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord wants every member in every locality to rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>GOD HAVING GONE AHEAD OF US</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If I am right, according to my discernment it is possible that the time has come.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The letters I have received from different places and the news I have heard from every place indicate that today in every place all the saints are ready to come forth to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has gone ahead of us; we must follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not my desire that even one brother from among us would go out and fail to lead the brothers and sisters to serve but would replace them instead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that when you go to a certain place, you will lead eight or ten to serve at the beginning and then after a certain time they will lead sixty, eighty, or a hundred to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then on your next visit you may see one or two thousand people serving.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you must use the five-talented ones to suppress the two-talented ones and the two-talented ones to suppress the one-talented ones, you are not the Lord s servant.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you must use the five-talented ones to replace the two-talented ones and the two-talented ones to replace the one-talented ones, you are not the Lord s servant.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You must cause all the five-talented ones to rise up and serve and all the two-talented ones to rise up and serve, and you must also cause all the one-talented ones to rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You must also cause those whom you think are not useful to rise up and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, the glorious church will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In Foochow I would rather see all the simple villagers serving than three or five outstanding ones preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I do not admire the outstanding ones.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I like the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In His graciousness the Lord could give us more Pauls and Peters, but He has not done so.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The whole world is full of one-talented brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What shall we do with these people?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Where are we going to put them?</S>
