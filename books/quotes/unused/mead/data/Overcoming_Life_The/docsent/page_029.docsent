   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SURRENDERING BEING TO LET GO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, what happens when we see the Lord s death for us on the cross, and what happens when we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We immediately stop trying to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As soon as we believe, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Similarly, when we see that the Lord has brought us to the cross and crucified us there, we will cease fighting and stop improving ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we believe that the Lord is living within us and overcoming for us, we will stop our own work and allow God to rescue us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will say, Lord, I will never improve, and I do not intend to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From now on, I will not do anything, I will not manage anything, and I will not be concerned about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From now on, I will let go, and problems will no longer be my problems.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brothers and sisters, this is surrendering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some have said that it is very difficult to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When temptation comes, they have to put up a fight, and when their temper rises up, they have to wrestle with it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they resolve to stop doing something and fail, it only means that they make a stronger resolution next time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, one more resolution only means one more failure, and one more promise only means one more broken promise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more resolutions one makes, the more he fails.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the first resolution is not strong enough, the second resolution will not work even when it is stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 7 describes this well: To will is present with us, but to work out the good is not v. 18 ! No promise that is made is appropriate, because we have not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are still managing our own affairs, and we cannot say that we are crucified with Christ and that it is no longer we who live.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Dying is letting go, resigning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is giving up our efforts to take control and ignoring them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are no longer able, God will become able.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the first thing is letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was a brother by the name of Lee in Tientsin who once asked me how he could resign and let go.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said that he could not resign or let go.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I asked what he did in his company, and he told me that he was the manager of the textile department.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I asked, If the general manager of the company told you that you were no longer needed by the company the following month and that you were fired, what would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that the only thing he could do would be to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I asked, Suppose the next month came, the new manager arrived, and you transferred everything to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What would you do if a buyer came to you and asked, Manager, what kind of new fabric do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is its price?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How much do you think this price will go up in two days?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brother answered, If it happened a few days before the new manager arrived, I would make some calculations and find out what the company had in stock and how much it needed to stock up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if I had already transferred everything to the new manager, I would have nothing more to do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All I could do would be to watch others work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is letting go and surrendering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is what it means to be crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to say to the Lord, I am not resigning because I am capable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am resigning because I cannot stand it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am not capable of doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I cannot manage anything any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why I have to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My temper is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My pride is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My stubbornness and jealousy are all still present.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can do nothing about them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can only make a transfer and resign.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I can only say that everything is in Your hands from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, when the buyers from the street show up, we must not be alarmed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are many buyers who come every day to solicit business.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All we have to do is commit everything to the Lord s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not have to care for or manage anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the meaning of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the meaning of surrendering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>SATAN S TEMPTATION BEING</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>TO TRY TO MAKE US MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do you know what temptation is?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One brother said that he was always tempted to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Another brother said that he was always tempted to be stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>One brother complained that he was always tempted by unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Another brother complained that he was always tempted by a quick tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It seems that there are a thousand different kinds of temptations to a thousand different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But brothers and sisters, there is actually only one temptation in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We think that temptations lead us to temper, pride, greed, or adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But with Satan, there is only one temptation the temptation to move.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Satan does not induce us to lose our temper or to be proud, greedy, or adulterous.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His temptation is to make us move.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As long as we move, Satan prevails over us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It does not matter how we move.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As long as Satan becomes successful in initiating a move, we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In our prayer and reading of the Bible, he has won the victory the minute we move.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I only wish I could speak with many tears in my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not move.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The minute we move, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We can struggle with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can fight with him or withstand him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But the minute we move, Satan has gained the complete victory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have to realize that the secret to our victory lies in our standing by; it does not lie in our taking control.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once we try to manage the situation, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brothers and sisters, this is a most amazing thing!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God wants to set us aside and allow His Son to overcome for us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Galatians 5:17 says, For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This verse does not say that we oppose our lusts or that our lusts oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It says that the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We do not play any part.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>These two parties are opposing each other.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A brother once lamented that his only desires were sin and uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He could not help himself.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>But it is the flesh who is fighting against the Spirit, and the Spirit who is opposing the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We play no part in this fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is God s way of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we can stand back and allow the Spirit to fight against the lusts and the lusts to fight against the Spirit, we will experience deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When I was first saved, I heard a story about a young girl who knew the meaning of victory very well.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>During the Keswick Convention, a man asked the little girl how she overcame when the devil came to her.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>She answered, In the past, if the devil came to knock at my front door, as soon as he knocked, I would say, Don t come in. Don t come in. But the result was always a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Now when the devil knocks at my door, I say, Lord, You open the door for me.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If the Lord opens the door, and the devil sees the Lord, he will say, Sorry, I came to the wrong door, and he will run away.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When we are tempted and say, Lord, save me because temptation is coming my way again, the devil will come in even before the door is open.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We have to allow the Lord to handle the matter completely.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The more we pray, the more desperate we become, and the more we repeat our prayer, the harder it is to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>A brother once said that when Peter was sinking, he said only, Lord, save me.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Praying with a short sentence is letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But if one continues to pray, Lord, save me..., five or six times, he is already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I call this kind of prayer a hangman s prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is like a person who tries to hang himself a second and third time after having been unsuccessful the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When a person repeatedly prays this way, it shows that he has not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He is trying to grasp victory with his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He is trying to overcome with his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Invariably, the result is defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If he did not pray so much, he still might have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Brothers and sisters, please remember that Satan is trying to make us move.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>As long as we move, even if it is by praying, he will have his way.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Suppose you lose your temper every time you are agitated by others.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>What will you do today?</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>What are you going to do when someone continues to agitate you with his words, and the agitation grows increasingly worse?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Lord, I do not take control of this matter; my temper is not my business; victory is Your business.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I cannot control my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Lord, You must be responsible for this.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If you can say this, you are indeed letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The Lord will take over, and you will live out His patience.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>You will even be able to thank and praise Him, saying, Lord, I do not take responsibility for this anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>However, if you feel that you cannot bear the agitation, and you pray, Lord, deliver me, for I am about to lose my temper, fifteen minutes will seem like fifteen hours to you.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>You may not lose your temper outwardly, but inwardly you will be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This is not victory.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Satan does not need to make you lose your temper in a big way.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>All you need to do is move a little, and he will have the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Overcoming is refusing to move.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Overcoming is disregarding the situation and turning away.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If you do not move, and if you disregard the situation and turn away, you are letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Victory has nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>You are dead already; it is Christ who overcomes for you.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Victory is for you to die and for Christ to live.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Recently in Chefoo, many brothers and sisters discovered the overcoming experience.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>One sister had a difficult past.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Her husband was very unkind to her, and she was ill-treated by her mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>She endured, but she did not overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>After she heard my preaching on the overcoming life, she received the word.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>But after two days, she came to me and asked how she could let go and how she could put herself in the hands of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>I tried to explain it to her, but she could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Finally, I asked the Lord to give me a suitable illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>I said to her, Mrs. So-and-so, have you ever taken a rickshaw ride to a friend s house? She said yes.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>I said, Suppose you arrived at your friend s house, and while you were paying the rickshaw man, your friend stepped in and tried to pay for you.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Even though you wanted to pay the money, your friend insisted on paying it.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Then when you returned the money to her, she tried to return the money to you.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Have you ever encountered something like this?</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>She said yes.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>I continued, Suppose she paid the twenty cents, and the rickshaw man took the money and left.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Since you did not want your friend to pay, you pressed your money into her palm.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>However, when you were about to leave, she stuffed the money back into your palm.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>After this back-and-forth exchange had been repeated several times, you decided to put the money on the ground and say good-bye to your friend.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>But then you wondered whether your friend would take the money and what would happen if she did not take it and someone walking along the road took it.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>You wondered what would happen if the rickshaw man took it or a little child saw it and took it.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>You therefore turned and looked to see whether your friend took it.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>When you saw that your friend had not taken it, you turned and peeped again.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>But as long as you turn and peep, your friend will never take it.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>However, if you put the money on the ground and said to your friend, The money is here; take it, and you ran away without looking back anymore, your friend would probably take it.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>After I told her this illustration, she understood and entered into the experience of the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>This is the way many people commit their affairs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>On the one hand, they say that they have committed everything to God.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>But on the other hand, their hearts are not at ease, and all the time they glance back.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>If you want to take control, He will not take control; instead, He will allow you to take control of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>If you will not take control anymore, He will take control and will bear the full responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>If you want to take control, it will be up to you to suppress your temper and you will have to pick up everything yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>What does it mean to surrender?</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>It means to leave the money on the ground and turn around and walk away.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>It means to ignore.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>It does not matter whether the children take the money away or the rickshaw man or a pedestrian takes it away.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>You do not worry about it anymore, and you do not take responsibility for it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>You need only to say to the Lord, Lord, I give everything to You.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>From now on, I do not care whether I am good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>Once you commit yourself to God this way, God will surely receive what you have committed to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>All that we need to do is to hand over what we have to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>We have to let go first before God will pick up what we have let go.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>However, we want to wait for God to pick it up first before we let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>But God wants us to let go first before He will pick it up.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>I told the brother whom I mentioned earlier that if his boss decided to lay him off on the first day of the following month, and if a new person were hired, he would have to transfer everything over to the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>During the interim period, he would be responsible for half of everything, and the new person would be responsible for the other half.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>This transition between the old and the new is an overlapping exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>But for God, He either takes up everything or He takes up nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>He will never take up half and leave it up to us to take up the other half.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>We have to quit on the thirty-first, and then God will move in on the first.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>If we try to quit gradually, God will not take over.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>Brothers and sisters, one of our greatest sins is an evil heart of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>We try to control ourselves and suppress ourselves every day.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>We are the ones who are controlling and suppressing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>We wonder what would happen if we did not control or suppress ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>When we preach the gospel to an unbeliever, we tell him that he should not worry about anything, because Christ has died for him; he needs only to believe and he will receive everything.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>In the same way, we have been crucified with Christ, and Christ is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>Thank and praise God that Christ is our Head and we are His members.</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>Christ is the vine and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>He is our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>When we are removed, when we give up, resign, and turn away, Christ will begin to take over.</S>

   <S PAR='225' RSNT='1' SNO='225'>I asked whether she had gotten through.</S>
   <S PAR='226' RSNT='1' SNO='226'>She used to go to the mountain to pray all the time, and she answered, saying, I went to the mountain today and dug another grave for myself and made another burial.</S>
   <S PAR='227' RSNT='1' SNO='227'>I asked her a few times, and she always answered this way.</S>
   <S PAR='228' RSNT='1' SNO='228'>I knew that she had dealt with many difficult sins already, but she was still not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='229' RSNT='1' SNO='229'>I prayed for her, but there did not seem to be much result.</S>
   <S PAR='230' RSNT='1' SNO='230'>One day I prayed that God would give me the utterance to help her to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='231' RSNT='1' SNO='231'>She was playing a hymn that day.</S>

   <S PAR='235' RSNT='1' SNO='235'>This might not mean anything to others, but to her it was a small sin.</S>

   <S PAR='241' RSNT='1' SNO='241'>She answered, But didn t you say that the condition for overcoming is first to surrender and second to believe?</S>

   <S PAR='263' RSNT='1' SNO='263'>Friends, we are too complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='264' RSNT='1' SNO='264'>God says that there is no need to do anything, but we still want to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='265' RSNT='1' SNO='265'>Many brothers and sisters say that they are letting go, but they still make letting go a kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='266' RSNT='1' SNO='266'>They struggle back and forth between letting go and not letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='267' RSNT='1' SNO='267'>They are still exercising their own strength in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='268' RSNT='1' SNO='268'>Brothers and sisters, letting go means that you are through.</S>
