They need to be cleaned and washed often, or else they will not be transparent. Every time the eyelids are closed, tears flow out to wash the eyes. Similarly, in the spiritual world, the spiritual eyes of those who do not shed tears must not have been washed. Therefore, they cannot see clearly. It is no wonder that those who have never been wounded, afflicted, or have never encountered anything that was heart-breaking, distressful, or depressing to their spirit are ignorant and unclear about many things.</P><P>Once the parents of a child were quite good and quite zealous for the Lord. They did a great deal of good work for the Lord. But after a short time, the child whom they dearly loved died. They became very angry and said, "From now on we will not serve God any longer. Although we have served Him faithfully, He not only did not favor us with His grace, but He allowed our child to die." They were quite upset. From then on they became indifferent; they were no longer zealous and no longer pursued the Lord in a serious way. One day after eight or nine years, the father was walking in the wilderness. He saw a shepherd trying to lead a flock of sheep across a little creek. In the country side there are usually no sturdy bridges over the little creeks. In this case, a little wooden plank over the creek served as a bridge. It was adequate for people to walk across but very difficult to convince the sheep to walk across. Sheep are very timid and unsophisticated. No matter how much the shepherd goaded and coerced them, they would not cross it. Finally, out of desperation, the shepherd picked up a little lamb who was not weaned and precious to the mother sheep. He carried him across to the other side. The mother sheep, out of love for her little lamb, took the risk and followed the shepherd across. Soon after, all the lamb's brothers and sisters followed and crossed to the other side of the creek. The father, who was observing this, said, "It is enough!" From then on, he was revived. Later he testified, "Because God was afraid that I would be left on this side of the creek and would not go across, He took my child over first. Even the dumb sheep knew to follow the others across. Why then am I still tarrying here?"</P><P>Many times tears bring men closer to God. If a person has only passed through smooth and peaceful pathways and has never suffered the deprivation of wind, sleet, frost, and blizzard, he can never advance to become a deeper person. If he is willing to be a Christian only in peaceful times and unwilling to be one in days of tears, he is merely a mediocre person with little experience. Today many people will not believe because they have never suffered pain. Yes, if someone in the world fills his days with laughter, eating, and drinking, he can do just fine if no extraordinary events occur. However, anyone who cannot shed tears will not be able to see the light. No wonder they are still in their stupor, drunken with the worldly wine, and have not yet received salvation. Christians have also hardened their hearts and are unwilling to wipe their eyes with tears. No wonder they are so dull in spiritual matters.</P><P>Let us study the Bible and see what it says about tears and how we should deal with them. We do not need to rejoice or laugh. Rather, we need to mourn and weep because today is the time for weeping. This world is a place for weeping. Let me say again that people who put their tears aside are unenlightened. They do not know their place on earth. Oh, whoever cannot shed tears has lost their characteristic as a man. Indeed, the shedding of tears is the real meaning to human life. Let us see what the Lord would like us to be. In the entire Bible, there are only a few dozen references to tears. Today we do not need to read all of these verses; it is sufficient just to read several of them. What we are about to speak today can be summarized in several points: the meaning of tears, the relationship between tears and the repentance of sinners, and the relationship between tears and the prayer and work of the believers. At the end we will see what God does with our tears.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 19: Notes on Scriptural Messages (3) &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
