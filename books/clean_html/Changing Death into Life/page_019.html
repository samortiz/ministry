<h2 class="head1">BECAUSE OF SINS</h2>
<p>After the Lord healed the impotent man, the Lord said to him, &ldquo;You have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you&rdquo; (v. 14). This shows that his sickness and impotence were the issue of his sins. This also means that impotence, the lack of strength, in human beings is the result of sins. If we consider our condition and the condition of others, we will realize that people are impotent because they commit sins and because sin is in their being. Just as sin made this man sick, impotent, lonely, and miserable, sin also makes us impotent and helpless. Who is not impotent? Who can help others? Who has someone to help him? Impotence, helplessness, and desolation are commonplace in human society. Everyone lacks strength, and no one comes to help. As a result, everyone is impotent and wretched. Man&rsquo;s impotence and wretchedness come from sins. This condition is the issue of man&rsquo;s sins.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PROLONGED, INCURABLE SICKNESS</h2>
<p>The impotent man had been sick for thirty-eight years (v. 5); he had a prolonged, incurable sickness. Many impotent people are in the same condition. Some people have been playing cards for many years, and they cannot break away from playing cards. People hate gambling and long to break away from this bad habit. Deep within them is the feeling that gambling is a great problem in their human life. They are aware of their sickness and desire to quit, but they are unable. This is what it means to have a prolonged, incurable sickness.</p>
<p>Some people smoke cigarettes. Some may think that this is a small problem, but regardless of how hard these people try to stop smoking, they cannot stop. This is also a prolonged, incurable sickness.</p>
<p>Some people know that they have a bad temper. They do not want to lose their temper, but they cannot overcome it. Once two women asked me about the problem of losing one&rsquo;s temper. They asked, &ldquo;How can we get rid of our temper?&rdquo; They said that if they would not lose their temper in front of their spouse and children, there would be happiness in their family. They had not been able to control their temper from the day they were married. These women had a prolonged, incurable sickness.</p>
<p>Some people tell lies, some live in hatred, some cheat others, and some always quarrel with their parents. They all want to be freed from these weaknesses, but they are unable to free themselves. They all suffer from a prolonged, incurable sickness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A WAY BUT NO STRENGTH</h2>
<p>People are unable to break away from their sickness, because they are impotent. They are unable to deal with a small problem, and they are unable to drop a small habit. This is called impotence, a lack of strength. It is not that there is no way to be freed. There is a way, but there is no strength. There is a method, but there is no strength.</p>
<p>The impotent man had been sick for thirty-eight years, but he was not without a way to be healed. In front of him was a healing pool. From time to time the water in the pool was stirred up, and the first person to step in the pool was healed (v. 4). This is a wonderful way of healing. However, this man was so weak that he did not have the strength to take this way of healing. He could not step into the pool before others, because he had no strength. As a result, he could not be healed. As far as he was concerned, there was a way to be healed, but he lacked the strength to take that way.</p>
<p>Is this not the condition of many people in the world? Many people have a way of salvation, but they do not have the strength to be saved. The people in Judaism, Islam, Confucianism, and Buddhism have a &ldquo;way of salvation,&rdquo; but they do not have the strength to obtain the salvation that they seek. Although these ways are unreliable, these people still do not have the strength to obtain the salvation that they desire. For example, the way of salvation in Judaism is to keep the law of God. The way of salvation in Confucianism is to cultivate one&rsquo;s morality and character. Even though these ways of salvation are not reliable, people do not have the strength to obtain the salvation that they desire. People in the world are seeking salvation in morality. They have a way, but they do not have the strength.</p>
<p>Suppose a man likes to smoke cigarettes. He does not smoke opium; he smokes only cigarettes. One day he says to his colleague, &ldquo;I hate that I smoke. I will quit smoking today.&rdquo; His colleague replies, &ldquo;I bet that you cannot throw away the cigarettes. If you can, I will lose the bet and will give you something.&rdquo; The man says, &ldquo;You are taking me lightly! You think that I cannot throw away a small cigarette? If I can throw them away, you lose.&rdquo; The colleague says, &ldquo;We do not have to wait for a long time. If you do not smoke for two weeks, I lose.&rdquo; The man agrees. The first day he grits his teeth and does not smoke. The second day he really begins to struggle. When he sees his colleague, he smiles. He is smiling outwardly but suffering inwardly. On the third day he is unable to resist, so he goes to the restroom and smokes secretly. When he returns to his desk, his colleague asks where he went and whether he smoked. He says that he did not smoke. Now he has told a lie. He has committed two sins. Nevertheless, his colleague can tell that something is wrong. On the fourth day the man is truly suffering because of his craving to smoke some more. Therefore, he sneaks off to the restroom again. This time his colleague follows him and catches him.</p>
<p>This example shows that there seemingly is a way, but the man has no strength. He wants to quit smoking, but he does not have the strength. People are the same in that they try to leave their evil ways and return to the right path. It is not that they do not have a way but that they have no strength.</p>
<p>There is the saying that a general can command an army of two hundred thousand soldiers, but he cannot rule over a small cigarette. Two hundred thousand soldiers listen to him, but he listens to a small cigarette. How weak man is!</p>
<p>Some people are smart, strong, and capable of accomplishing great things, but they cannot throw away a small glass of alcohol. They can control many things, but they cannot control alcohol. Rather, they are controlled by alcohol. This is their impotence. It is not that alcohol is powerful but that they are impotent.</p>
<p>Those who love to go dancing are also impotent. When they see others dancing, they cannot control the urge to dance. When they hear a song, they start dancing inwardly. They cannot stop. Some people dance until midnight and do not want to stop. Someone who loves dancing once said to me, &ldquo;Mr. Lee, you do not know that dancing is also a suffering. Before I was saved, I danced until after midnight. Then my legs were sore, and my lower back hurt. I would lie in bed and cry out, &lsquo;Why am I in such a pain? I will not dance tomorrow!&rsquo; But the next evening I was tempted inwardly and had to go dancing.&rdquo; He did not want to go dancing, but he could not overcome the urge within him. He was tired of dancing, but he did not have the strength to stop this addiction. This is an example of man&rsquo;s impotence.</p>
<p>Is there even a small problem or a habit, such as a little temper, that you can eliminate? Can you refrain from losing your temper? Many people hate their temper, but they cannot stop themselves from losing their temper. I have seen people who hit and curse themselves when they lose their temper. Then they determine not to lose their temper again. However, on that same day they eventually lose their temper once again. There may even be such people among us. You are capable, but you cannot overcome your small temper. You have many good methods, but you do not have the strength. The Chinese dictionary does not have the phrase <em>moral strength,</em> because there is no such thing as moral strength. The ability to do good, the strength to be moral, is not found in man. Man&rsquo;s sinning can be likened to water flowing downstream. It is very difficult for man to do good. It is very easy to sin, but it is very hard to do good. The reason for this is that we are impotent, having no strength.</p>
<p>There are many philosophies, doctrines, and methods that try to teach people to do good. The Chinese have Chinese ways. The Egyptians have Egyptian ways. The Europeans and Americans have European and American ways. The Indians have Indian ways. However, can people succeed using these ways? In spite of good religions and human philosophies, people are still in a chaotic condition. This is not because there is no way but because man has no strength.</p>
<p>Chinese philosophy concerning human conduct involves honoring parents, loving siblings, being honest, and having integrity. This way and teaching of the sages are very good. Every Chinese person knows that he should honor his parents, love his siblings, be honest, and have integrity. However, who honors his parents? Who loves his siblings? Who is honest? Who has integrity? We need to consider this matter. We often are willing to honor our parents, love our siblings, be honest, and have integrity, but we do not have the strength. This is to have the way but not have the strength. Because we have the way but not the strength, we do not do what we will. Therefore, we feel pain and are unhappy.</p>
