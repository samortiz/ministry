   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR THINGS THAT MUST BE CONSECRATED Consecrating People</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first thing to do after overcoming is to consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is putting yourself and all that you have on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Specifically, we should consecrate four things to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first is people, that is, all the people who are related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man loves many people, the Lord will have no place in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, no one in this world will occupy your heart any longer, and no person can seize your heart away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God saves you in order to gain full control of you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, many tears are holding you back, many human affections are enticing you to turn, and many broken hearts are calling you to return.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You have to say to the Lord, "Whom do I have in heaven but You?/And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth" Psa 73:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a consecration is not for the future, but for today; it is something that we can do today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today we can cut off all human affections and human relationships and give the Lord the preeminent place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consecrating Careers</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second thing we should consecrate is our career.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not need to consecrate ourselves to be preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many preachers today are not consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, we need to consecrate ourselves to do God's will, to seek after His will, and to find out what His will is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A brother, as a high school student, was always the first in his class.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was determined to be the first in his final examination and would not settle for less.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He devoted all his time and energy to his study, and his love for the Lord was diminished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, he had a breakthrough in the matter of overcoming and realized that it was wrong for him to have such an ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He prayed to the Lord, "If it is Your will, I am willing to even come last in the class."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This student was a genuine brother in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the end he overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He experienced the overcoming life in his academic pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers, if you have any aspirations in your business or career that you cannot let go and if there is anything that you insist on having, you have to consecrate yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have to consecrate your career, aspirations, and ambitions totally to the Lord so that you can do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Consecrating Things</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third item we have to consecrate is things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is easier for a rich man to forsake the Lord than for a poor man to forsake the Lord because the heart of a rich man is with his money.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nothing in this world belongs to us; everything belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we have to consecrate everything to the Lord and put everything we have on the altar 1 Chron 29:12-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people squander their money.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not pleasing to God, of course, but some save up their money in a way that does not please the Lord either.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, a sister would not spend even a dollar in fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Squandering has no place before the Lord, just as thrift has no place before the Lord either.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of our saving and spending will be judged by the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever the Lord wants us to spend our money on, we should spend it accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Offering in the New Testament is different from that in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The principle in the Old Testament is tithing, offering one-tenth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the principle in the New Testament is offering up ten-tenths; it is offering up all that we have into the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God will not allow us to go hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may worry about how we are going to support our living, but God wants us to first offer up everything to Him and then draw our needs from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first day we take home our wages, we should say to the Lord, "All of this money is Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I offer it all up to You."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After we have received our wages, we should first offer them up to the Lord and then use them according to His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we receive our wages, it is wrong to first spend the money on what we need and then give the rest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Witness Lee lives in a big family.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He and his two brothers hand over all the money they earn each month to their mother, and then she dispenses it according to each one's need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This should be how it is between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not offer to God what is left from our own spending.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rather, we should offer up everything to God and then allow Him to supply us with what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no need to dispose of all the possessions we own from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If God wants us to offer up everything, we should offer up everything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We may sell all our possessions and deposit everything in the bank, wait for God's future leading, and then offer it all up for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we offer in this way, the bank which keeps our money will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It will not be foreclosed because God will guard His own deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In this world, five percent interest is considered to be high, but the Bible says that when we offer to the Lord, we will receive a hundredfold in this world Matt 19:29 !</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is ten thousand percent interest!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What a bargain!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Brothers and sisters, God will not shortchange us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the past we have passed up many God-given opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the matter of material offering, I have much experience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have experienced many blessings that were brought in through offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A sister once offered the entire one hundred twenty dollars that she earned in a month to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When treasures are in our hand, they are either squandered or kept.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if we offer up everything to the Lord, we will not dare to spend loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After we consecrate our money to the Lord, everything will become the Lord's, and He will keep it or use it as He sees fit.</S>
