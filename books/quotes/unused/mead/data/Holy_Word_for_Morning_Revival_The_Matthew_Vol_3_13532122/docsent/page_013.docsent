   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 12 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 16:21-23</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>21 From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>22 And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shall by 1 no means happen to You!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>23 But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, 1 Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2 You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are 3 not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The last station of the pathway to glory is the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ was the Pioneer, the Forerunner, in taking the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the unique way for Christ to be released, and it is also the unique way for the church to be built with Christ and upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the revelation of the great mystery concerning Christ and the church, the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ were unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order for Christ to build His church, He had to go to the religious center, pass through crucifixion, and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 21 the Lord first revealed to His disciples His crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before this time, He had not mentioned anything about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following the revelation of Christ and the church, the Lord Jesus revealed to His enlightened disciples His crucifixion and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we see Christ and the church, we must be prepared to take the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may be wondering what the way of the cross is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To take the way of the cross is not to reserve anything of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No matter how good, right, or profitable you may be, you need to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the enjoyment of Christ and for the building of the church, we must be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nothing of our being should be reserved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 21 the Lord Jesus spoke both of His crucifixion and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The disciples, however, picked up the matter of crucifixion, but neglected the matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The disciples heard that the Lord was to be killed, but it seems that they did not hear that He would be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, the Lord did say that He would be raised on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They did not grasp this part of the Lord's word because they had no concept of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We immediately take in whatever corresponds to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if a certain thing does not correspond to what is already within us, we do not take it in. Again I say that although the Lord Jesus spoke of two matters, crucifixion and resurrection, the disciples grasped the first, but not the second.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without Peter, we would not have so many revelations, for through his boldness in making mistakes a number of revelations were given.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here in verse 22 Peter was bold enough to rebuke the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As Peter was rebuking the Lord, his expression might have been that of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter's words "God be merciful to You, Lord" sound very nice, but they were actually a rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter had been offended by the Lord's word about being killed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because he was fully in himself, he actually rebuked the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>571-573</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>22 1 The natural man is never willing to take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>23 1 Christ perceived that it was not Peter but Satan who was frustrating Him from taking the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This reveals that our natural man, which is not willing to take the cross, is one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>23 2 Or, You are a snare to Me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>23 3 When we are setting our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, we become Satan, a stumbling block to the Lord on His way to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>571-574; Hymns: #593</S>
