<h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM BROTHER CHOU HSIN YI</h2><p>Dear Mr. Nee in the Lord:</p><p>Yesterday I sent two drafts of articles concerning the question of head covering and one notebook. I hope you can check them and correct them for me. There are many mistakes in the second article. It would be best if someone could copy it over after you have corrected it.</p><p>Last week I started to compile and translate the record of the last conference. It is very strange, and I do not know why, but this time there are more difficulties than usual. I had originally decided to spend two or three days transcribing one message so I could finish it in two months. But as I have been writing, many unexpected things have occurred. I am barely able to put a message together in four days. It has become a great strain on me. I feel that I cannot use my brain. I cannot remember anything, and it is hard to focus my thoughts. I do not have any strength in my prayer either. My whole being feels weak, and I do not have mental energy. I cannot resist all these conditions! Before, I only had to resist with some strength, and then my energy would return. Nothing works now, it seems as if there is not even the slightest bit of warmth. In my heart I want to do this, but something hinders me. The worst thing is that I have forgotten many of the things that I used to remember. Nevertheless, I think that I will be able to do it well, Mr. Nee. I will need your help, however, to get through this difficult situation. I must not fail in this matter, no matter what. I hope you will give me some leading to get through this kind of situation.</p><p>I received the 1913 and 1914 issues of The Overcomer from England a few days ago. I finally obtained the books that I wanted for so long. I am really happy! May the Lord allow me to gain the riches from it.</p><p>Brother Shen Wei Chih came to Hangchow to rest. The three of us live together. Every day he helps me do some transcribing work. Peace through the winter!</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Hsin Yi<br />November 8</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS FROM SISTER YU SU CHEN</h2><p>Greetings to Mr. Nee:</p><p>A few days ago Miss Lee and the sisters passed through Nanking on their way to Hankow. I went to the boat to see them. I heard that you were sick, and I wondered whether you had gotten better. Thank God for His grace, I received much spiritual training in the last conference at Hangchow. Of all the conferences we have had over the past few years, the last one was unprecedented. I constantly thank and praise the Father God! Although I constantly fail, He is never willing to let me go. His holy hand is always stretched out to deal with me. I have been in Nanking for more than six months. A few sisters meet together on the Lord's Day to pray and read the Bible. After coming back from Hangchow, I planned to terminate this sisters' meeting to wait for the Lord's time to bring brothers to Nanking. I also planned to do some individual work so I did not announce that we would meet again. But the sisters came of their own accord; for the last three weeks we have had sisters' meetings. I heard that the Chin Ling Men's Seminary has some brothers who love the Lord, who want to invite you to Nanking. There is a Brother Wang among them who was clearly saved through you. He once told a sister that if you could come to Nanking to meet in any place, they would have many people who would come to hear you. (Their students often ask, "What should we preach when we go out?") The sister told me this later, and I have prayed for this often since then. On the twenty-ninth Sister Rachel Lee told me on the boat that you bear the responsibility for the regions of Chenkiang and Nanking, so I mentioned this matter to Sister Rachel Lee. If you can come to Nanking, we invite you to stay with us. It is very convenient. The meeting place can hold fifty to sixty people. This is my respectful report.</p><p>There is another question that I hope you can answer. A sister used the train with a free ticket. After she was enlightened, she decided to pay back this money. According to the principles of the Bible, property should be returned to its rightful owner, but the person who got the free tickets for her is a member of a denomination who is in the middle of committing a great sin. If she gives this money to him, he would not give it to the government or the railroad, and it would give him more opportunity to sin. Although this sister was saved when she used a free ticket, she had not consecrated herself. Now all that she has is given to God, so this amount is consecrated. Whom should she return this money to? Please advise us. This sister will also add a fifth part so that the total comes to about one hundred fifty dollars. Where should she send it? We are waiting for an answer. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>From,<br />Yu Su Chen<br />November 7</p><h2 class="head2">Answer from Brother Tang Shou Ling</h2><p>Use a post office money order and send it in a double registered letter to the Railroad Authority. Enclose an explanation: She rode the train on a free ticket which was obtained unlawfully. Since she has believed in the Lord Jesus and has been saved, she knows that this is unrighteous. In addition to the amount of the tickets, she is adding on twenty percent interest and returning the money. She does not need to mention who got the free tickets for her.</p>
