God will never entrust His authority to such kinds of people. If a man has a natural liking to put his hands on others' business, God will not be able to use such a person. Man has to be like God, who does not like to control anything. If God wanted to control anything, He could remove the tree of knowledge of good and evil, or He could put a fence around the tower of Babel. He could remove the fiery sword from the cherubim. But God would not do such kinds of things. He never likes to interfere with the liberty of others. Man has to make his own choices. Some brothers and sisters like to interfere with others' affairs. But God has no interest in such kinds of things. He never forces anyone to believe. He says, "Every one who believes...would have eternal life" (John 3:16). Everyone who receives has eternal life. He does not force man to believe. If a man has been dealt with by God to such a degree that he no longer has a liking to interfere with others' business, God will entrust His authority to such a one.</P><P>A man should not have a desire to interfere with another member in the Body. If a man has been taught by God, he will firstly have no desire to interfere with others' affairs. Second, he will gladly seek advice from others concerning his own affairs. If we practice this, when thousands of members come together, with each one having no desire to interfere with others' business while gladly seeking advice from others, a beautiful Body life will be realized. If we do this, we will be balanced. God has no desire for us to be busybodies.</P><P>We have to be a person who has learned the lessons, and we have to reject and restrict all forms of individualism. On the one hand, we have to accept limitations. On the other hand, we have to learn submission. It is a joyful thing to pursue after submission. Today, in the whole world, in all the nations and among all the societies, there are all kinds of opinions, voices, expressions, and arguments. This is why all organizations have their rules, and when they conduct meetings, some are given permission to ask questions whereas others are given permission to answer. Those who speak cannot go on beyond a certain number of minutes. This proves that even in the world, an individual has to be limited by the group. Of course, this limitation is an artificial one, and not one that is done in submission.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Submitting to the Arrangement of the Head,<br>and Receiving the Riches from the Members</H2><P>The first sin of man was rebellion, lawlessness, and the overthrowing of authority. Satan's fall and rebellion were caused by his uplifting of himself to be above God. If we submit ourselves to God's authority today, we will have the proper testimony. We have to realize that not everyone has the authority, and not everyone has the word of God. The testimony of the Body today has nothing to do with numbers, but it is a matter of being in the Body. It is a matter of being willing to submit to the arrangement of the Head, as opposed to being free to make one's own choices and decisions. As a member of the Body, we cannot make any decision on our own. Christ has an immeasurably vast deposit in the church today. If we are in a receiving position, we will surely become very rich. If we insist on receiving only from God without receiving from the Body, we will become very poor. This is not a doctrine, but a fact. Not only is the thing I have my own, but what the brothers and sisters have is also my own. In many matters, other brothers and sisters have a clear discernment, but I do not have discernment. As such a one, I have to accept the discernment of the brothers and sisters. Some people know God's word. Some can discern the truth. I should gladly receive their discernment and judgment. What I do not know, someone else will know. If we will not receive from others, probably we will end up fifty years from now having the same as what we have now.</P><P>It is a strange thing that we have to exhort the brothers and sisters to receive from others. On the one hand, men say that they are poor and weak. On the other hand, they are not willing to receive riches from others. Is this not a strange thing? How rich are the ministries that God has raised up in the church today. Yet we are still in hunger. The reason for this is that we emphasize our own individualism too much. A man has to learn to bow down his head and to receive supply from others.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> </body></html>
