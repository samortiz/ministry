<h2 class="head1">THE PROOF OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:15-16).</p>
<p>The fact of our regeneration is something we can know now. As soon as we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit comes into us and witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God with His life and nature. After being saved, whenever we pray, we love to call God &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; Whenever we call Him &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo; we feel so happy within. The more we call God &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; the more comfortable we are inside. This proves that we are regenerated children of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:13).</p>
<p>We not only have the inward proof of the Holy Spirit telling us that we are regenerated, but we also have the outward proof of the Bible, the Word of God, which confirms this matter. First John 5:13 says that the preceding verses, which are also the Word of God, were written so that we, who believe into the name of the Son of God, would know that we have eternal life. God placed many words in the Bible which assuredly tell us that we have eternal life and are regenerated as soon as we believe into His Son. Therefore, from God&rsquo;s Word, the Bible, we know that we have God&rsquo;s eternal life and are regenerated.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:14).</p>
<p>In addition to the Holy Spirit within and the Bible without, the love we have for our brothers in the Lord confirms that we are regenerated. Our love for the brothers lets us know that we have passed out of death into life. Because we ourselves were begotten of God, we spontaneously love the brothers who also have been begotten of God. Thus, our love for our brothers who are born of God is a proof that we are born of God and are regenerated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECURITY OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28).</p>
<p>Once we are regenerated, we will never perish. The Lord said that He gives us eternal life, so we will by no means perish forever. Eternal life is the eternal life of God that sustains us inwardly, so we will by no means perish forever. Moreover, we also have the Lord&rsquo;s powerful hand keeping us outwardly, so no one can snatch us away.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a young black slave in America who heard the gospel and was very joyful when she heard this Bible verse. When she went back to her master&rsquo;s house, she could not contain her joy. When one of her master&rsquo;s friends saw her condition, the friend asked, &ldquo;Why are you so happy?&rdquo; She replied that she was in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, and the Lord&rsquo;s hand was so powerful that no one could snatch her away. The friend made a joke and said, &ldquo;You better be careful! Do not be too happy! The Lord&rsquo;s hand is so big and the cracks between His fingers are also big, but you are so small. If you are too happy and are not careful, you might fall through the cracks!&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Sir, let me tell you that I also have the Lord&rsquo;s life, and His life is in me, so I am the little finger on His hand and will never fall off!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:29).</p>
<p>After we are regenerated, we not only have the Lord&rsquo;s powerful hand keeping us, but we also have the Father&rsquo;s powerful hand keeping us. The Father is greater than all. Since both His hand and the Lord&rsquo;s hand are keeping us, who can snatch us away and cause us to perish? Therefore, once we are regenerated, we are eternally secure. We will never perish.</p>
