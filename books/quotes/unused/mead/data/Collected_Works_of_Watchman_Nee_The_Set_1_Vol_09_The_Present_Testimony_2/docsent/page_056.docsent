   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW COVENANT 6 Issue No. 33 Scripture Reading: Matt 26:28; Heb 8:10-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This morning we saw the items included in the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have spoken only three things during the past three days: God's promise, His fact, and His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This morning we saw that the first item of the new covenant is the forgiveness of sin, cleansing, and anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second item we saw was that God's anointing allows man to know God directly and that there is no need for anyone to be taught by his neighbors, brothers and sisters, or parents.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can fellowship with God and speak to God according to the covenant, and there is no need for anyone else to teach us or instruct us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The third item we saw was that the indwelling Holy Spirit enables us to do what is pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It enables us to have the new life which walks and acts for us and within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We will come to this later.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This afternoon we will consider how our sins are forgiven according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will review what we may have forgotten, including what God has done for the saved ones and the things that we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some time ago our Bible study covered the two aspects of sin, which are our sins before God and the sin within man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, many new ones among us do not understand this difference.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, we have to say something about this again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the Bible, there are two aspects to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first is the record of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every sin before God demands a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second is the sin within us which is a master that lords over us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This master of sin dominates us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In regard to sin, there is a distinction between the sin in man and the sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sin in the conscience is different from the sin in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The sin before the law is different from the sin in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The sin before God is different from the sin within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The sins before God are the record of sin before Him; they cause us to have no peace while living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sin within us is the power that rules over us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most unsaved people have no peace when they think of the sins they have before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When they are touched by the Holy Spirit, their conscience cries out, and they realize that they are condemned sinners before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The once dormant conscience is then awakened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When they consider the coming judgment, the punishment which they deserve, and eternal pain in hell, they tremble and wish that their record of sin could be immediately removed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most of us sitting here today have received the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>While we were hopeless and helpless, the gospel was preached to us: the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He shed His blood to forgive and cleanse us from our sins, and He suffered the judgment and punishment which we deserved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has fully borne the burden of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His death has become our death, and His shedding of blood has become our shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When He suffered God's judgment and punishment of wrath, we were also brought to the cross and passed through God's judgment of wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His death has saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we can pray and thank God, for He has full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have been saved through the Lord Jesus; we have been cleansed of our sins and forgiven, and we do not have to suffer any punishment anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the day we were saved, we have felt that the burden of our sin has been lifted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our transgressions have been forgiven and we have been cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are no longer just sinners, but saved persons who have received God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have the Holy Spirit within us, and spontaneously we cry, "Abba, Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have a life union with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord's death has removed the record of sin that was against us and contrary to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God is pleased to accept the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, your sin before God is taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Does this mean that we will no longer sin?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No. Many times, we still have unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We still lose our temper, and we can still be jealous and proud.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We say that sin has been removed, but why are we still sinning?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to realize that the blood of the Lord Jesus has only dealt with our sins before God; it has not dealt with the sin within us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible shows us two aspects of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The record of sins before God has been removed by the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the sin within us can only be dealt with by the Lord's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not the so-called eradication of sin, as some have preached, but the crucifixion of our old man through the cross of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Two days ago we saw that sin is the master within us, the old man is the agent in between, and the body is the slave outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord does not deal with us like the philosophers, who tell others to try their best to buffet their outward bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nor does the Lord remove our sin by eradicating it within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, when He was crucified, He took our old man along with Him to the cross so that the body of sin becomes unemployed and annulled, and we are no longer slaves to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Previously in our Bible study with the brothers and sisters, we have seen that there is a great difference between the function of the Lord's blood and His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is a difference between the sin in the conscience and the sin in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is also a difference between the sins before God and the sin in man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Bible never says that the blood will cleanse our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It only says that the blood cleanses our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is the part that condemns us, the part that makes us feel our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord's blood can make the conscience no longer feel the sin and no longer fear the punishment of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But the sin of the heart may still remain.</S>
