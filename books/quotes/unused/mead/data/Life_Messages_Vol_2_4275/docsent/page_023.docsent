   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Value to the City and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This meeting is not only for the church, but for the whole city as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every church which practices this will be a lampstand shining over the darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It will acquire a name as a place that knows the truth and can teach the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>New ones will be added.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our own young people will be taught too.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After perhaps four years of hearing such messages, all the saints will be ready to graduate!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But those who take the lead must not consider themselves professors!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are merely laborers, taking the lead for others to follow and help.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of meeting will really be in the nature of a training.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Week after week, as we listen to the speaking on the Word, we shall be learning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the same time, we shall be spontaneously trained.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we can set up a small class in our home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, instead of just a few teaching and preaching, the whole church will be qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Besides the Lord's Day meeting, there can be several home meetings, with classes for our neighbors and friends, where many of the saints can teach and preach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of preaching is the most prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It will surely bring in the new ones and reap other benefits as well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It will lead to a real knowledge of the living Word, to the growth in life, to the experience of Christ, to the shepherding of others, and to the building up of the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the churches feel burdened, they can begin to have a preaching, teaching meeting, as we have suggested here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To make a success of this, the whole church needs to get into the Word with much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you read the Bible without prayer, you will be in the dead letter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You should spend twice as much time in prayer as you do in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every church needs to be characterized by reading the Word and by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not to say that you need to come together to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, individually the saints should be praying and reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On this earth we are the ones who pray, read the Word, and digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the saints must know the Word, have life, have the Spirit, and have an impact through praying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NOT SEEKING OUTSIDE HELP</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the past too often the churches have called on those from other places to come and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates a weakness on the part of the responsible ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why would you not labor on the Word yourselves and contact the Lord directly, instead of sending out a Macedonian call, "Come over and help us" Acts 16:9 !</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may seem humble to say that your church is weak and needs help, but is this wide open door the best way to get help?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What was the result of all the calls that went out for help?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually one came who was not weak, and the churches were deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must learn the lesson from this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not look to Anaheim or to Brother So-and-so for help.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Call the heavens and contact the Lord directly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if you feel weak, do not admit it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be proud is ugly and sinful, but to be strong is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You are not in need of outside help.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even if it is offered, you should seriously consider whether to take it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How much real outside help have you gotten these past few years?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The supposed help you have received has only further weakened, even poisoned, you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You opened the door to this because you thought you were weak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A housewife with five children may feel unable to cope with her situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She keeps asking one neighbor after another to come and teach her how to manage and show her how to cook for her household.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No one has time to be of help until one day a woman comes and offers to cook for her, saying she will be glad to help her out.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the family eats the meal the woman has prepared, they all get sick.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She has poisoned it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Is that the kind of help you want?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not open your door without investigating any offer of help.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Be sure the one who offers is qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Check his status and background.</S>
