<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The problem between man and God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Due to man&rsquo;s sin, man is not right with God.</li>
	<li>Man lost God because of his sin, and man also lost all the blessings given by God.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s sin also caused him to come under the judgment of God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jesus accomplished redemption for man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus died on the cross to accomplish man&rsquo;s redemption according to the requirement of the righteousness of God.</li>
	<li>The redeeming blood takes away man&rsquo;s sins before God.</li>
	<li>The blood of the Lord Jesus reconciles man to God.</li>
	<li>The blood of the Lord Jesus brought man back to God and recovered God&rsquo;s blessing upon man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The blood of the covenant
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The blood which the Lord Jesus shed on the cross not only paid the price of redemption, but also was the seal of the covenant.</li>
	<li>In the age of grace, God not only accomplished redemption for us, but also made a covenant with us. In this covenant, He promised to forgive our sins and restore our relationship with God, so that man might be able to receive all the blessings given by Him.</li>
	<li>The blood of the Lord Jesus is the price and the seal of this covenant.</li>
	<li>When we receive the blood of the Lord Jesus, we receive the price of the redemption of sins and receive the seal of this covenant. Therefore, when we receive the blood, our sins are forgiven, and we also have the seal of forgiveness.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to receive the blood of Christ
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are sinful and that you are not right with God.</li>
	<li>Confess that the shedding of the blood of Christ on the cross is for your redemption.</li>
	<li>Receive Christ and His redemption.</li>
	</ol></li>
