   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Careful to Make Up Lessons</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the meeting for the edification of the new believers, there is one point that we need to pay attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who are responsible for visiting the new believers must learn these topics well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Otherwise, when they go out, they will not be able to help the new believers make up the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I hope the brothers could realize this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Perhaps the new believers' message is an hour and a half long.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, when they make up lessons for the new believers, they finish it in two minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not that they speak just the outline; they speak an outline of the outline.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I remember that some brothers, when they made up lessons for others, spoke just one sentence: "The message for the new believers today says that we need to read the Bible every day.''</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not say anything wrong; what they said was correct.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when you go to a person's home to make up lessons, if you only speak a sentence such as, "You need to read the Bible every day,'' I think this word is equivalent to not speaking anything, unless the Holy Spirit works in a special way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You should not speak just one sentence; you must be trained to speak carefully paragraph by paragraph so that those who listen may feel as if they have gone to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, the loss is quite great.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Please remember that after the gospel has been preached, the future condition of our meetings depends on whether or not the new believers' edification meeting is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are those in our midst who have just heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the meeting for the edification of the new believers is not strong, then we have no way to meet their need.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must learn to lead them onward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How strong the new believers' meeting is determines how strong the next generation will be.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you cannot help the new believers' meeting to be strong, the next generation cannot be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yes, the people have all believed in the gospel and are all saved, but there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That is something similar to what a revival meeting does.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is preaching and there is a result, but no church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Teaching and the Fellowship of the Apostles</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I want you to especially remember what is spoken in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Acts 2:42 says, "And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 41 speaks of baptism, and verse 42 says that they continued in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please remember that the apostles gave teaching and fellowship immediately after the church had three thousand people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the edification of the new believers is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What the apostles were doing there is what we are doing here today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The so-called edification of the new believers is the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today you cannot say that once a new believer is saved, you can indifferently let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You must give him teaching and tell him to continue steadfastly in this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The gospel preaching meeting brings the new believers in. After this we need to raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have begotten so many and are not able to raise them up, the church will never be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the gospel preaching must be strong and the new believers' edification must also be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both must be strong in order that we may have a future.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE MEETING ACCORDING TO 1 CORINTHIANS 14</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all have to learn and wait much before God concerning how to have this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This meeting is all the brothers and sisters gathering together and some preparing themselves before God to be led to rise up to function.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people can surely give the church much help when they function.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, in this meeting you can have personal testimonies, sharing, and more than one brother speaking.</S>
