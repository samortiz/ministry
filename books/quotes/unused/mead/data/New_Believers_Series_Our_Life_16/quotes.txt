[1]  OUR LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 3:4; Phil 1:21; Gal 2:20 I. CHRIST OUR LIFE
[2]  They think that the Lord set up a good pattern for us while He was on earth and that we should imitate this pattern.
[3]  If a Christian does not know what is meant by Christ our life, and what is meant by for to me, to live is Christ, he will not experience the Lord's life on earth; he will not be able to follow the Lord, to experience victory in Him, or to proceed on the course before him.
[4]  Many people pray, fast, and hope that one day they will be crucified with Christ and reach the state when "it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."
[5]  If you make it your goal and hope to attain such a state, if you aspire to be crucified, that is, to no longer be the one who lives but instead to have Christ living in you, you will wait forever before seeing your aspiration fulfilled, because you are hoping for something that is impossible to achieve.
[6]  This experience clearly shows that they are practicing the Christian life in a wrong way.
[7]  Paul said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."
[8]  It is the Lord in you who is living the Christian life, not you living it by yourself.
[9]  If a person cannot say, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me," this person does not know what Christianity is; he does not know the life of Christ, nor the life of a believer.
[10]  If I am not crucified with Christ, I am still I. How can I say, "It is no longer I"? Only those who are "crucified with Christ" can say, "It is no longer I."
[11]  Romans 6 says that God has crucified us with Christ.
[12]  But Romans 7 tells us of one person who is still trying to will.
[13]  Instead, we should bow down our head and say, "Lord, You have said that I am crucified, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I am useless, and I will say the same thing; You have said that I cannot be patient, and I will no longer try to be patient; You have said that I cannot be humble, and I will no longer try to be humble.
[14]  The other part of Galatians 2:20 is also very important: "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God."
