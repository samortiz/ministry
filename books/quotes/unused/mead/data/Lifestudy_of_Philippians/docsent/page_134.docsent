   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is crucial for us to realize that, having passed through the various steps of a process, the Triune God today has become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 7:39 says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the Spirit of God has always been in existence, this verse nevertheless says that the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The expression the Spirit here denotes the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit processed to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This Spirit is all-inclusive because it includes not only divinity, but also humanity, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It includes all the three-one God is, has, and has accomplished and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the Spirit is the totality of all the three-one God is, has, and has accomplished and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE SPIRIT EMBODIED IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is even more difficult to define the Word than it is to define the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament, the Son of God is called the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Revelation 19:13 says of Him, His name is called The Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past we have pointed out that for Christ to be the Word of God means that He is the definition, explanation, and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this understanding is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must go on to see that the New Testament indicates that the Word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, Ephesians 6:17 even identifies the Word as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit, and the Word are one in a very mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the previous message we pointed out that the Spirit is the consummation of the process through which the Triune God has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also indicated that the Word is the consummation of God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But why is the Word the Spirit and the Spirit, the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I admit that this matter is very difficult to understand and explain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a help to our understanding, we may use the striking of matches as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matches are made of phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, a match is the embodiment of phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As such, in a very practical way it is identical to phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that the match is phosphorus and phosphorus is the match.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Applying this illustration to the Bible and the Spirit, we may compare the Bible to the match and the Spirit to phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, because a match is made of phosphorus and is the embodiment of phosphorus, it makes phosphorus available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Triune God today is the Spirit, and the Spirit is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although it is rather difficult for us to handle the Spirit, we can easily carry a Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just as we have phosphorus by having a match, so we have the Spirit by having the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO STRIKE THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, even though the Word is the embodiment of the Spirit, many Christians do not contact the Word through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To use the illustration of the match, when these believers strike the Word, the match does not light, even though they may love the Bible very much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we want to light a match, it is not adequate merely to love the match.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to strike the match in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same principle, if we would contact the Spirit embodied in the Word, we need to strike the match of the Word by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose someone tried to light a match by analyzing it or by exercising his emotion to express his love for it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indeed would be useless, even foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To light a match does not require that we analyze it or love it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We simply need to strike it in a proper way, and it will suddenly burst into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In like manner, if we want to contact the Spirit through the Word, we should not merely analyze the match of the Word or express our affection for it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once again I say we need to strike the Word in the proper place, and that place is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Seminaries and Bible schools, however, instruct believers to analyze the match or to love it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not emphasize the way to strike it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would strike the match of the Word, we must learn to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not use your mind or emotion to strike the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Word will only light up in our experience if we strike it in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the reason we need to exercise our spirit to pray when we come to the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is to pray-read the Word.</S>
