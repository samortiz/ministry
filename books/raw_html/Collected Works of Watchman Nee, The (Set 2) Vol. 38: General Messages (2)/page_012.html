<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>When God created man, He gave man a free will, so that now there are three wills in the universe. One is the will of God, the second is the will of Satan, and the third is the will of man. Man wonders why God would not destroy Satan quickly. But God would not do this. He wants man to join Him in dealing with Satan. God has His will, Satan has his will, and man also has his will. God wants man's will to be joined to Him; He does not want to destroy Satan alone. We do not fully understand, but we know that God wants to do it this way. He does not want to act alone; He wants man to cooperate with Him. This is the responsibility of the church on earth.</p><p>In order to do something, God must first put His will within us through the Holy Spirit. He will only accomplish something after we have echoed it in our prayer. God operates through this procedure. He works this way. He wants man's cooperation; He wants a will that is one with Him and that echoes Him. If God does everything without us, then man does not need to be here, and we do not need to know God's will. Yet every part of God's will needs someone to carry it out, and He wants our will to become one with His will. The first step in carrying out His will is to pray out God's will and utter His will through our prayer. From this we see that prayer is a work. There is no work more important than this work because prayer is the speaking of God's will and the accomplishment of His will. Brothers and sisters, we have to know that God's will is uttered through our prayers. Therefore, prayers that originate from our self-will are useless prayers. Prayers that are according to God's will originate from God. He conveys His will to us through the Holy Spirit, and then we return the same thought to Him through our prayer. Prayers that are after God's heart have God's will as the starting point; man is merely the transmitting and responding organ. Prayer that originates from ourselves has no spiritual value.</p><p>In reading church history, we find that every great revival began with prayer. Prayer enables God to do what He wants to do. We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, yet we can delay what He does want to do. God is absolute, and we cannot change Him at all. We cannot ask God to do what He does not want to do, and we cannot ask Him not to do what He wants to do. However, if God needs a channel to carry out His will and we do not cooperate with Him, His work will be hindered on account of us. Hence, when we pray, we are not asking God to do what He does not want to do, and we are not asking Him to change His will. Rather, we are declaring God's will in prayer so that He can do what He intends to do. If we think that by begging desperately we can make God do what He does not want to do, we are wasting our energy; the effort is fruitless. If God does not want to do something, no one can make Him do it. We can only do one thing, and that is to pray for God to do what He wants to do. God will accomplish His work through our oneness with Him.</p><p>The descending of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was prophesied a few hundred years prior to its occurrence, in the time of Joel. Yet many disciples had to pray before the Holy Spirit would descend on them. God had ordained it already, but there had to be men who prayed before it could be fulfilled. Although God can do everything alone, He loves to wait for man to pray before He does anything. God can do many things, but He is waiting for our consent. God is willing to accomplish many things, but He is waiting for our willingness. God is ready to do many things, but without our consent, He still has to wait. Brothers and sisters, although we cannot force God to do what He does not want to do, we can ask Him to do what He wants to do. We have lost many spiritual blessings because we have not expressed God's will through our prayers.</p><p>It would be wonderful if we could engage ourselves exclusively in the work of prayer. God is waiting for man to cooperate with Him so that He can accomplish His work. Some Christians have asked why God does not save more sinners. Why does He not make every believer victorious? We sincerely believe that God would do these things, if there were men who first prayed for them. God is not reluctant to work. He is waiting for a group of people who will cooperate with Him. As soon as man cooperates with God, He will work. There is much spiritual work to be done, but God is waiting for His children to respond. Whether or not the work will succeed depends on how God's children pray. We should respond to God by consenting to work together with Him. He is waiting to bless us. The question is whether or not we will ask.</p><p>Those who do not know God will say, "If God wants to do anything, He can do it all by Himself. Why is there the need for our prayer? God knows everything. If we pray too much, we may tire Him out." We have to remember that man has a free will. God will not act contrary to His will, but neither will He take over man's will. If man does not pray for God's will, He has to wait. If He wants His will to be done on earth as in heaven, He can do it Himself. Why does He need the disciples to pray, "Our Father who is in the heavens...Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth"? (Matt. 6:9-10). If God wants His kingdom to come, He can do it Himself. Why is there the need for His disciples to pray, "Your kingdom come"? If God wants His name to be sanctified by all people, He can do it Himself. Why does He have to ask the disciples to pray, "Your name be sanctified"? The answer to these questions is that God does not want to do anything alone; He wants man's cooperation. God is powerful, but we have to lay the tracks. The more tracks we lay, the more God works. Therefore, our prayers should be like a railway network, the more the better.</p>
