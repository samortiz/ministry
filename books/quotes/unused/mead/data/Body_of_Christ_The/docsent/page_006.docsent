   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEMBERS OF AN ORGANISM,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to see that the church as the Body of Christ is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have the burden to point this out because when many Christians talk about the church, they have the understanding that it is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to reject this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not a part of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are members of an organism, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we go to visit another local church, do we consider ourselves as being one with the saints in that locality?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may unconsciously feel that we belong to the organization in our locality and that now we are guests in the church which we are visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Humanly speaking, the saints we are visiting are the hosts and we are their guests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But spiritually speaking, as Christians, believers in Christ, we are members of the one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we go to visit the saints in London, are we merely a group of Americans in London?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Humanly speaking, we are Americans in London.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in the Body of Christ there are no human members; there are only divine members.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Body of Christ as a divine organism, we all are members in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we go to visit any local church, we should not consider that we are foreigners.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today we practice the administration of the local churches according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A local church is comprised of the saints with the elders, deacons, and deaconesses Phil 1:1; Rom 16:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you consider yourself as a saint, an elder, a deacon, or a deaconess in the local church where you are?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My point in asking this question is this in the local churches, we should not consider ourselves in an organizational way, considering ourselves as a part of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should only consider ourselves in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wherever we are and whatever we do, we should consider ourselves as living members of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we gather together in the Lord, we all should function as living members.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Wherever we go, we are the living members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I go to Anaheim, I go there as a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I go to Taipei, I go there as a member of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I never consider myself as someone who belongs to an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the members of the organic Body of Christ, we should live in an organic way.</S>
