   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RIGHT AND WRONG BRINGING IN DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible only tells us that life is light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It never says that right and wrong are light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the contrary, right and wrong always bring in death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To touch right and wrong is to touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everyone knows that darkness is death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The opposite of good and evil is life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The darkest person is the one who is not transparent, one who is living in death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What brings us into darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is good and evil that brings us into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we need to do today is to touch life, because life is light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we touch good and evil, they will bring in death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CRITICISMS BRINGING IN THE POISON OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps you think that this is a very small matter, but I do not consider this as a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever you criticize someone, you fall into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All God's children agree that criticizing others is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to realize that not only is criticizing others sin, but it is something that will lead you into something else; it will lead you into good and evil, and right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It will bring the shadow of death into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we have sin, we need forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when we have poison, we need healing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For you to criticize someone is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, criticism not only brings you into sin; it brings you into contact with the poison of death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why we have to be delivered from good and evil, right and wrong, and darkness and death, so that we can become a transparent person in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>BEING DELIVERED FROM THE STANDARDS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>OF RIGHT AND WRONG, AND GOOD AND EVIL</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many years ago, I was afraid of criticizing others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once I criticized others, I felt that I had sinned, and I would go and confess my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now also I dare not criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But now I do not criticize because I am afraid that I would come in contact with right and wrong; I am afraid that the poison of good and evil will come into me once more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, in order to maintain ourselves transparent before God, we have to be delivered from right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Years ago, when I did not criticize others, I was doing it to keep myself clean.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was like a child who would not drink the water from the gutter because he did not want to be punished by his father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But now I am different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the analogy of the boy, I am not doing it now, not for fear of punishment, but for fear of the poison in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once a person argues, he is touching right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All those who argue may be very "clean," but they are not transparent within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person can be very right, yet remain very dark within.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is not living, and he is not transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Immoral things surely bring us into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But moral things bring us into darkness even more.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is true that the publican was condemned before God, but the Pharisee was altogether blind before God Luke 18:9-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A person may have nothing wrong, and he may be right in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Yet he is blind, and does not have the light or the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why is this so?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is because he is too good, too clean, and too right; he is a person who lives in right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As such, he is blinded, and he does not have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is not transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>EXERCISING THE SPIRIT TO ALLOW THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>TO BE STRENGTHENED</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, just as we condemn the world and evil, in the same way we have to condemn our mind, emotion, will, and the right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Education promotes these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet God is calling us out of these things, and He is teaching us to conduct ourselves in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should learn to conduct ourselves not according to these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason in Ephesians the apostle told us to be strengthened into our inner man Eph 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God wants the spirit within us to be renewed, nourished, cleansed, and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever we come across something, the first thing we have to do is not to exercise our mind, our emotion, or our will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we come across something, we have to learn to foster our spirit and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's salvation has transferred us from darkness into light, so that we would become those who live in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we stop exercising our mind and our emotion, and when our will becomes softened, our spirit will grow and will rise in stature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We are most worried about those who have a strong mind or a strong will but a weak spirit, or those who are rich in emotion but poor in their spirit, or those who are morally strong but spiritually weak.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should be a person who is strong in our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we are such a person, we will be transparent.</S>
