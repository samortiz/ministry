   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the life of the spiritual man, the first thing is the new birth: "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"a new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the new birth we get a renewed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Again it is written, "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh, and spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apparently there is a constant cleansing of the spirit needed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Lord "poured out His SOUL unto death," but He "committed" His SPIRIT to His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The soulish part of us must likewise be poured out to death, if the spirit is to be brought into essential union with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This separation of the spirit, from, what an old writer calls "the entanglements of the soul," is set forth in Heb iv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>12, "The word of God is quick and powerful...dividing soul and spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How often we are conscious of so much mixture in even consecrated believers, and how rarely you can meet a pure spirit; how often there comes a word, or action, first from the spirit, and then from the soul part, the emotions, the intellect, or the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As the spirit is brought into pure union with God, it becomes sensitive to the touch of "soul," either in yourself, or in others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You will meet the "soul" element as if it were some little bit of hard substance which checks the flow of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Or you will discover it in the varying states of your own life: at one time there will be communion with God, when the spirit is open to Him, and thus full of light; then without any apparent cause a veil falls over it, and it is dark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is just the action of the soul, you have gone back into the soul life, out of the light into the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence the importance of learning that position in Christ where the spirit is continually dominant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us look at this for a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul says "The God of peace sanctify you...spirit, soul and body."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God in the spirit sanctifying the soul, controlling and dominating the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fausset a Commentator of authority says, that "In the three fold division of man's being, body, soul and spirit, the due state in God's design is, that the spirit which is the recipient of the Holy Spirit, uniting man to God, should be first and rule the soul, which stands intermediate between body and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the natural man the spirit is sunk into subserviency to the animal soul, which is earthly in motives and aims.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The carnal sinks still lower, for in this the flesh, the lowest element rules.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not having the Spirit means that in the natural man, the spirit which is the highest part, and ought to be the reservoir of the Holy Spirit, is not so, and therefore the spirit is not in the state that God wants it to be."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From this clear statement you will understand that the spirit must be first, and dominate the soul, and through the soul control the body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The "spirit man" is he who has the spirit in its due order, ruling soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To become "spiritual" i.e., under the rule of the spirit, the word of God needs to divide the soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For at first when the man is a "natural man" the spirit is sunk into the soul, netted round as it were, and all bound up in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes the spirit gets a little light, and breaks into freedom, then the soul again predominates, and becomes like a thick film covering the light of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These phases affect the countenance when the spirit sinks down into the soul the face becomes shadowed from within, and when the spirit rises to the place of control, the face is full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In truth the outer man is, what John describes as a "lampstand," to hold the light that comes from the spirit, which is meant to be indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and filled with the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now the devil knows all about this, for he has studied man for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has observed, that when in meetings you have sung a spiritual song, you have broken into victory, and the spirit has ruled, then you have gone away to look upon a world that seemed different because all the dark shadows have disappeared in the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With this knowledge, he comes a long to the children of God who have the Holy Spirit dwelling in them, and he brings all the weights he can bring, stirs up all the troubles he can, and puts them on the spirit, and as these heavy weights press upon the spirit and presses it down into the soul, you lose your testimony, and the ringing song of victory; all because you do not understand what he is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To keep the spirit in real victory in union with Christ, you must understand the approach of the enemy, and know what he brings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This leads us to the spirit-warfare, we have in mind expressed in crude language doubtless, but expressing something that is real.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We want to get at this: what is victory, where is victory, how can we walk in victory?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The spirit is the place where the Holy Spirit dwells, and everything that God does in you comes from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is through our spirit He works out to soul and body, not from outside in!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The devil knows this, though we do not, and he brings things from the outside life to burden the spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From the outside he also gives supernatural power, working upon the emotions and the senses, and gets hold of the bodies even of the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It will help you to detect and to discern for yourself, to know that everything that the Spirit of God does, is through the organ of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is in your spirit that you learn to know God for the spirit is the sanctuary, the shrine, the organ of the Holy Spirit, and it is there that He bears His witness "The Spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have seen that the first thing the Holy Spirit does in regeneration is to give a renewed spirit, when you are "born of the Spirit," and you receive the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of sonship, when from your spirit comes the cry, "Father!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then you know God as your Father.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then you next receive the Holy Spirit as a Person, as the Sanctifier, and He fills your spirit and makes it the shrine where He dwells, and the centre from which He works, and in that shrine He brings you into union with Christ when you become "joined to the Lord, one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From the centre of the spirit He wields the Word of God, and cuts away the soul's entanglements with the knife of the Word; and as you obey that Word and submit to its requirements, the spirit becomes clarified, and drawn away from the soul-envelope into a deeper, closer, essential, perfect union with Christ the risen and ascended Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is only in this real union of one spirit with Christ, that He is able to exercise His authority through you over spiritual foes.</S>
