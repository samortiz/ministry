WARNING JOB THAT HE WAS FILLED<br>WITH THE JUDGMENT OF THE WICKED</H2><P>Next, Elihu warned Job that he was filled with the judgment of the wicked, telling him that judgment and justice had taken hold of him (v. 17). Here Elihu seemed to be saying that Job was not enjoying a table full of fatness because he was occupied with the judgment of the wicked, continually thinking that God should exercise His judgment upon the wicked, with justice being the verdict of judgment. Thus, judgment and justice had taken hold of Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. ADMONISHING JOB NOT TO LET WRATH<br>ALLURE HIM INTO SCOFFING TOWARD GOD</H2><P>In verses 18 through 23 Elihu admonished Job not to let wrath allure him into scoffing toward God, not to long for the night, and not to turn toward iniquity. In verses 22 and 23 he said, "Behold, God is exalted in His power:/Who is a teacher like Him?/Who has appointed His way for Him?/And who says, You have done wrong?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. REMINDING JOB TO MAGNIFY GOD'S WORK<br>IN THE UNIVERSE AND EXALT HIS GREATNESS</H2><P>Elihu went on to remind Job to magnify God's work in the universe and exalt His greatness (36:24&#151;37:13). In 36:26 Elihu declared, "Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him;/The number of His years we also cannot search out." In 37:5 he said, "God thunders wondrously with His voice;/He does great things that we cannot comprehend." Elihu's speaking here is a display of his ability and capacity to compose poetry. If we speak in such a way in the vital groups, the groups will be killed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. CHARGING JOB TO CONSIDER<br>GOD'S WONDROUS ACTS<br>IN THE SKIES AND ON THE EARTH</H2><P>Elihu then charged Job to consider God's wondrous acts in the skies and on the earth (vv. 14-23). He concluded his charge by saying, "The Almighty&#151;we cannot find Him out;/He is excellent in power,/And justice and the abundance of righteousness/He will not damage" (v. 23).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_087.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_089.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Job &nbsp; pg 88</div><br></body></html>
