   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message we want to fellowship concerning Christ's human living.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may think that Christ's human living was a common thing, but it was altogether uncommon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is because His human living was God's human living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was a man, but He lived God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We Christians are men, but we should also be those who live Christ, who live God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To say that we live Christ, that we live God, means that we and Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we say that we live for Christ, this indicates that Christ and we are two.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:15 that we need to live to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul also said in Philippians 1:21, "For to me, to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Philippians 1 shows that to magnify Christ v. 20 is to live Christ, not to live for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible does show us that we need to live for Christ and to live to Christ, but it also shows us that we need to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To live for Christ is somewhat shallow, to live to Christ is deeper, and to live Christ is the deepest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we say that we "live Christ," this is new utterance to convey the divine facts in our spiritual culture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The language serves the facts in a culture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need the spiritual, divine language to express the things in our spiritual culture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to speak as Paul spoke when he said that for him to live was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to be those who live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was a human living on this earth not just by man but by God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was God's living in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Christ's human living, the divine life was mingled with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the previous message on God's incarnation, we saw that the purpose of the incarnation was to mingle God with man that God and man might be one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can see the mingling of God and man in the type of the meal offering Lev 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Stanza 5 of Hymns, #86 says, "Thou as a man art tender, sweet,/Balanced in every way, complete,/Meal-offering to the Father meet;/Lord, I remember Thee!"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the meal offering, there were two elements.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One element was the fine flour made of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The other element was the olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The meal offering was made of fine flour mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word mingle means to combine two elements together to be one entity without a third element being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The two elements are combined together, but they still remain distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God and man are mingled together as one, but they still remain distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His incarnation, God entered into a virgin's womb and stayed there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then He was born to be a God-man and lived a human life within man for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to pay our attention to His human living and fellowship about it because today we Christians are repeating His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today God is moving in man, and He is living a human life in man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may have the boldness to say that Christ was God living a human life, but we would not say this about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, we would say, "I am a man living the divine life."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is God, we are men, and we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we would say that we are men living God's life.</S>
