After greeting them, Abraham had a large meal prepared for them, a meal consisting of cakes, a calf, butter, and milk
We see here that no matter what was to happen to him, Paul's desire was that Christ would be magnified in his body
In one verse Paul said that for him to live is Christ, but in another verse he said that he wanted to depart and be with Christ
By this we can see the difference between the human virtues and the virtues that are the magnification of Christ
Although we may not have such so-called wonderful experiences in the church life, we cannot deny the fact that we have experienced Christ
The experience of Christ is altogether a mystery, and this experience is unlimited, for it is Christ magnified
If you are certain that what you are experiencing is an experience of Christ, that is not normal, and you should question it
Although Satan does not want us to have the assurance of salvation, he may push us to have the false assurance of other things
Corinthians was written rather early in his ministry, but Philippians was written close to the time of his martyrdom
If we do not have any experience, we shall not have any mysterious questionings about what is happening within us
The more we love Christ, pursue Him, and live by Him, the more we shall doubt whether or not we are actually experiencing Christ
Philippians unveils the fact that the experience of Christ is the fellowship in the gospel until the Lord Jesus comes back
Notice that in verse 5 Paul does not speak of the preaching of the gospel, but of the fellowship in the gospel
From the time we are saved until the time the Lord Jesus comes back, our Christian life should be a gospel-preaching life
We are not here for our education, job, or family, and we are not here to earn money or to gain a reputation or position
In chapter one of Philippians, a chapter on the fellowship in the gospel, Paul says that some preach Christ out of envy, strife, and rivalry
Those on the same campus engaged in preaching the gospel may have rivalry among them concerning who will be the leader
According to the word of the Apostle Paul in Philippians, the first way to experience Christ is in the fellowship of the gospel
According to Matthew 1:20, the angel of the Lord told Joseph that what had been begotten in Mary was of the Holy Spirit
After Jesus' glorification, the Spirit of God, which is the Spirit of Jehovah and the Holy Spirit, became the Spirit of Jesus Christ
According to the Greek, in Acts 16:7 we find the term the Spirit of Jesus, and in Romans 8:9, the term the Spirit of Christ
It was not the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Christ but the Spirit of Jesus that did not allow them to go into Mysia
In Philippians 1:19 these two terms, the Spirit of Jesus and the Spirit of Christ, are combined in the term the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The first two chapters of Philippians are related to the Spirit of Jesus, and the last two are related to the Spirit of Christ
The reason Christians cannot be one soul is that each desires to be first and that no one is willing to be last
If we say I want to be in the Spirit of Jesus we shall immediately have the experience of Christ and be one spirit and one soul with others
The word 'together' in Philippians 1:27 means that we are coordinated and that we are not individualistic, but corporate
In order to reach the Head, we need the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus without envy, strife, or rivalry
If we are not in the Spirit of Jesus, we are not in the fellowship of the gospel, and we are through with the experience of Christ
To experience Christ we need the fellowship in the gospel by the Spirit of Jesus without envy, strife, or rivalry
Verse 2 indicates that in saying all this, the Apostle Paul was begging the saints in Philippi to make his joy full
Verse 2 says, 'Fulfill ye my joy, that ye think the same thing, having the same love, one in soul, thinking the one thing'
Verse 3 says, 'Let nothing be done through rivalry or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves'
Although we may preach the gospel, we may not have the fellowship in the gospel because we esteem ourselves higher than others
In verses 7 through 9 we are told that Christ emptied Himself, took upon Himself the form of a slave, and was made in the likeness of men
If we have this Spirit, we shall be in the fellowship of the gospel, and our preaching of the gospel will be prevailing and fruitful
Chapter one contains other unusual expressions, such as 'in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel'
Although our body has many members and is difficult to take care of, it is not as perplexing to us as our soul is
There is nothing wrong with having a thoughtful mind and a sensitive emotion, but they need to be adjusted by our will
Many have only an objective Christ, a Christ far away in the heavens, and do not know the Christ who is in their spirit
Simply to speak of the spirit in the experience of Christ is not adequate, for we have not only a spirit, but also a soul
Although the children may eat out of the fear of being disciplined, they do not enjoy the food they are eating
If there had not been so many opinions among the Philippians, the Apostle Paul would not have repeatedly told them to think the same thing
According to the Greek, Philippians 2:5 should be rendered, 'Think this among you which was also in Christ Jesus'
Strictly speaking, Philippians is a book not only on the experience of Christ, but also on the enjoyment of Christ
The book of Philippians is concerned not only with the experience of Christ, but also with the enjoyment of Christ
Many of those who have been in the Lord's recovery a long time are like children eating food without enjoying it
For years, we have spoken about the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ, but we have not seen the detailed way to enjoy Christ
If our way of thinking is dealt with, we shall have the proper taste for Christ and we shall both experience Him and enjoy Him
The last part of Philippians 1 and the first part of Philippians 2 are actually one portion and should not be separated
Paul does not speak here of loving our wives, submitting to our husbands, honoring our parents, or behaving in a kind, lovable manner
When all the members in the church are in one spirit with one soul, this oneness will be convincing, subduing, and attractive
We shall be able to say, 'We don't care mainly for how many souls are saved, or for how many people are brought to the Lord
If we are in one spirit with one soul, the number of people saved through our preaching of the gospel will be secondary
Verse 29 says, 'For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake'
Verse 2 continues, 'Fulfill ye my joy, that ye think the same thing, having the same love, one in soul, thinking the one thing'
What would have comforted Paul was that the Philippians would think the same thing have the same love be one in soul and think the one thing
In verse 2 we find not only the matter of the mind, but also the matter of the emotion, for love is a matter of emotion
If our love toward the saints has been regulated and dealt with, then we shall enjoy Christ as we love the saints
Verse 3 says Let nothing be done by the way of rivalry or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves
If everyone in a family, for example, has the same opinion, that family will have a wonderful time of enjoyment
If the father, the mother, and the children have different opinions, there will be no enjoyment in that family
We can sympathize with the Apostle Paul because among us today we have different levels of love, not the same love
Paul was telling the Philippians that they needed to be together in their soul and that they should not hold different opinions
Paul was begging the Philippians to have mercy on him by thinking the same thing and by not having any discord among them
The longer we are in the Lord's recovery, the more we shall learn and the more experiences we shall accumulate
When many of us saw the light regarding the Lord's recovery, we dropped everything of the past and came together to practice the church life
The remedy for this illness is firstly to take care of the request of the Apostle Paul, who begged that his joy might be made full
To fulfill the joy of the Lord's servant, we need to think the same thing, have the same love, and be together in the soul
Paul told the Philippians that each man should look not on his own qualities, but also on the qualities of others
Although it was not robbery for Christ to be equal with God, He emptied Himself, not insisting on this equality
When we take care of the request of the Apostle Paul and look on the qualifications of others, we enjoy the supply of the Spirit of Jesus
The Christ revealed in chapter two and pursued by Paul in chapter three is not for individual experience, but for the Body life
Spontaneously we shall drop our opinions and care for the request of the Apostle Paul and for all the other saints
We shall look not only on the gifts and graces we have received, but also on all the qualities, advantages, and good points of others
If we all look on the good points of others more than on our own good points, we shall be balanced and rescued from extremes
We do not merely have an outward pattern, for this pattern is in our very being, living Himself out from within us by the Spirit of Jesus
The most important thing for us to do is to experience Christ as our enjoyment today so that the church may be built up
If we do not take this way, the Lord's recovery will be damaged through our opinions accumulated over the years
If we are like this, the Lord will have the glory, we shall have the enjoyment, and the church will be built up
When the Gentile dogs under the table ate the bread that was for the children of God, the dogs became children of God
The dogs in Matthew 15 refer to the Gentiles, but, as we shall see, the dogs in Philippians 3 refer to the unbelieving religious Jews
Spiritually speaking those who eat dog food become dogs and the Gentile dogs who eat the food of the children of God become children of God
Although the Philippians had been transformed from dogs into children of God, at a certain point they turned away to dog food
The one thing is not merely the objective Christ, but the subjective experience of Christ as our enjoyment for the church life
We should constantly be thinking about how to experience Christ as our rich enjoyment so that we may have the proper church life
He was asking them to drop all other thoughts and to take his word so that they might think the one thing and be one in soul
Both the brothers and sisters need to be rescued, the brothers out of their mental hell and the sisters out of their emotional hell
Although we are the saved children of God, we may still fall into the hell of murmuring or into the hell of reasoning
During the course of such an argument, both the husband and the wife fall into a hell because they are not thinking the one thing
We may consecrate ourselves and follow the inner anointing, but still not have very much of the enjoyment of Christ
Whenever we do this, we are immediately in the enjoyment of Christ and our family life and church life become very pleasant
Because God is working in us both the willing and working for His good pleasure, we can do all things without murmuring or reasoning
Actually and in a practical way, we behave like children of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation
There is no need for us to behave ourselves, because we are shining as lights and holding forth the word of life
Paul seemed to be telling the Philippians, 'How good it is that you are thinking the one thing and enjoying Christ
The enjoyment of Christ is in the fellowship in the gospel in the thinking the one thing in having the same love and in the oneness of soul
In order for an animal to be clean, it must chew the cud like a cow or sheep, and it must also have a divided hoof
A divided hoof signifies discernment in walking, discernment regarding what we should do, where we should go, and the way we should take
In other words, when the Apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, fleshly circumcision was no longer honorable, but dishonorable
All their intentions in doing things for God are a form of rebellion, for they are rebelling against God's present economy
It is not evil to love the law, but the attitude expressed in loving the law when God has changed the dispensation is evil and rebellious
Verse 3 also mentions three items: worshipping by the Spirit of God, boasting in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh
Do not think that those who rob a bank are in the flesh, but those who donate to charitable organizations are not
The generous ones may be more in the flesh than those who rob, and those who love may be more in the flesh than those who hate
When the sisters who live together are having problems with one another, perhaps over washing the dishes, they need to reject themselves
When they reject themselves, including their attempt to imitate the pattern of Christ, they will find that Christ remains within them
If a sister washes dishes after doing this, she will have both the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ
If we do not trust in ourselves, the self is spontaneously dealt with and Christ is there as the sweet remainder for us to experience
Surely things such as circumcision, being of the stock of Israel, and being of the tribe of Benjamin were a gain to Paul
Although we are familiar with the term the experience of Christ, it is difficult to explain how to experience Him
It takes little effort to deny the worst kind of self, but it requires a great deal of energy to deny the best self
In Philippians 3 we find the contrast between two kinds of righteousness: the righteousness of the law and the righteousness of God
One kind of righteousness is the righteousness of the law, and the other kind of righteousness is the righteousness of God
There is one kind of righteousness which is of dead letters and another kind of righteousness which is of the living God
Verse 6 says, 'According to zeal, persecuting the church; according to the righteousness which is in the law, blameless'
In these two verses 'according to' is used three times: according to the law, according to zeal, and according to righteousness in the law
The third comparison is that between the righteousness of the law and the righteousness which is of God by faith
One day, however, the Lord brought His disciples to Caesarea Philippi and asked them to tell Him who people were saying that He was
Although Peter received the revelation in Matthew 16, in Matthew 17 he acted foolishly on the Mount of Transfiguration
One day, on the road to Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly shined upon him, and he was knocked to the ground
The brother said, 'Brother Lee, you have said that Christ had no outward beauty or comeliness, but that He was beautiful within
On account of the excellency of this knowledge of Christ, Paul came to realize that the law cannot compare with Him
Although the Christ that remains when all other things have been counted loss may seem to be quite small, He is very precious
When some Christians speak about experiencing Christ, they become greedy and desire to swallow all of Christ at one time
Some of the young people are impatient in the experience of Christ and complain about enjoying only a little of Him at a time
Tis not hard to die with Christ When His risen life we know; 'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings When our hearts with joy o'erflow
Experiencing the power of Christ's resurrection requires that we repudiate the flesh, the self, and the natural man
To know the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, we must know the difference between Christ's sufferings and our common sufferings
We, on the contrary, suffer not because we are fulfilling God's will, but because we have made so many mistakes
To remain in this kind of suffering is to share in the fellowship of Christ's suffering for the fulfillment of God's purpose
Christ's humanity was like a shell, and He as the embodiment of God was concealed and confined within this shell
We need to experience the kind of death that breaks the shell of our humanity and releases the glory of the divine life within us
At that time, others will be able to see in us and upon us the working of death that kills our flesh, self, and natural man
The land had been destined for them and assigned to them, but they had to take possession of it little by little
According to the Greek, in verse 12 Paul speaks of obtaining that for which he had been obtained of Christ Jesus
The Jews could say, 'All the nations are dogs, but we are the chosen people of God, the peculiar possession of God
One day the Lord Jesus brought His disciples to Caesarea Philippi and asked them who people were saying that He was
When He asked them who they thought He was, Peter immediately replied, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God'
They could recognize Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, but they could not believe that He would be crucified and resurrected
In order to eat Christ, we must deny everything, including ourselves, our mind, our cleverness, our knowledge, and all our good points
Although we have enjoyed Christ to a certain degree, we all have been frustrated and hindered by our natural heritage
Christ has taken possession of us, not that we may go to heaven or be good Christians, but that we may obtain Him
We must deny not only our hatred but also our love not only our pride but also our humility not only our dullness but also our intelligence
The more things you deny, the more Christ will replace you and the more He becomes your experience and enjoyment
The way to obtain Him, gain Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him is to deny whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we can do
Now He is waiting for us to experience Him and enjoy Him by denying all things and by counting all things loss for His sake
Hundreds of students may graduate at the same time, but only one is the valedictorian, one whose graduation is outstanding
A student becomes valedictorian by doing outstanding work in his studies and by being filled with all he has learned
The more we receive of Christ, the more qualified we shall be to attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead
Everything during Paul's time, including Judaism, Greek philosophy, Gnosticism, and Roman politics, was versus Christ
It may be a new religion, a religion invented by us, but it is nonetheless a religion, for we are trying to please God without Christ
In Philippians 3:14 Paul said, 'I pursue toward the goal for the prize of the above calling of God in Christ Jesus'
Whenever a visitor comes to the meeting, he should be convinced and subdued and say, 'Here is the testimony of Jesus
Verse 15 says Let us therefore as many as are fullgrown think this and if anything otherwise ye think God shall reveal also this unto you
We may forget about the experience of Christ and become occupied with things such as shouting and releasing the spirit
If we argue with one another and compete with one another, we do not experience Christ because we are not in our spirit
Do not say, 'Brother Lee, you have been in the Lord for more than fifty years and have a great deal of experience
We all want to be filled with Christ so that we may attain to the outstanding resurrection, the out-resurrection from among the dead
Because Paul had been instructed with the particular secret, he could handle any situation, whether he was rich or poor, filled or hungry
Although we were put into Christ on the day we were saved, to the feeling of many Christians they are not yet in Christ
We should count all things loss and not treasure or appreciate anything of our natural man, such as our humility or other virtues
In this country the young people are anxious to be eighteen years of age, for then they can fly away from the cage of their family
The reason we do not have a victorious Christian life is that we are not faithful to live by Christ and to do things absolutely in Him
Of all the Epistles written by Paul only Philippians is clearly and definitely related to the experience of Christ
As we have seen, Philippians comes between Ephesians, a book on the church, and Colossians, a book on the Head
Rather, they considered themselves worshippers of God and workers of good, for they tried their best to keep the law
In verse 3 Paul says For we are the circumcision which worship by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and trust not in the flesh
Anything that is not of God, by God, and with God is not holy, for in the entire universe God is the only One who is holy
In Exodus, many things are described as being holy: the holy place, the holy mountain, the holy tabernacle, the holy anointing oil
In Exodus many things are described as being holy because in this book God comes to man and man is brought to God
When you are about to worship God or do something for God, you must be reminded not to do these things in yourself
If there is nothing left after you put yourself aside, then there is nothing of the Holy Spirit in what you are about to do
Anything we do that is not Christ Himself is evil in the eyes of God, and when we do things that are not Christ we are evil workers
In order to do this, we need to see the vision that anything we do that is not Christ is evil in the eyes of God
Some may feel that they do not have the ability to discern between Christ and the good points of the natural life
Paul's intention in verses 2 and 3 is to lay the foundation so that in the following verses we may know how to experience Christ
Paul belittled religion to the uttermost, calling the religionists dogs and making light of all natural goodness
If we have Paul's vision, we shall hate our love, our patience, our humility, our niceness, our kindness, and our goodness
We Christians should not trust in anything we have by our natural birth, for anything of our natural birth is part of the flesh
In order to experience Christ, we need to see that everything we do must be by the Spirit of God, in Christ, and with no trust in the flesh
Only by worshipping by the Spirit of God, by boasting in Christ Jesus, and by not having any trust in our flesh can we be acceptable to God
We shall realize that even the best worship of God is the barking of a dog if it is done without the Spirit of God
If we have the vision regarding these three things, a good foundation will be laid for the experience of Christ
In order to understand what the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is, we need to see some other contrasts in Philippians 3
Anyone who does not have the revelation and the vision of the excellency of Christ will become involved with the law
When the Lord Jesus came He offended the Judaizers because He changed the dispensation of the law to the dispensation of Christ or of grace
When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he was such a person, a Pharisee, a persecutor of the church, and one blameless according to the law
Paul counted all things loss first on account of Christ, then on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
We should not be people according to anything, but people on account of Christ, on account of a wonderful Person
Paul also said that he counted all things loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord
According to the first chapter of John, Christ was not only God, but the very means, the channel, through which everything came into being
Acts 2 reveals that the very Jesus who was crucified on the cross has been exalted by God to be the Lord and the Christ
In Romans 1:4 we are told that Christ was designated in the power of resurrection by the Spirit of holiness to be the Son of God
Colossians 1:15-17 go on to say that Christ is also the Creator as well as the Firstborn of creation, the first item of all the creatures
Colossians 1 also reveals that Christ is the Firstborn from the dead in resurrection and that He is the Head of the church
Hebrews 1:2 and 3 say that Christ is the heir of all things, the effulgence of God's glory, and the express image of God's substance
Finally, the book of Revelation shows us that this wonderful One is the redeeming Lamb with seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God
On account of this excellency, he counted as loss all things, whether they were related to religious gain or natural gain
In the previous message we covered the three occurrences of the phrase 'on account of' in Philippians 3:7 and 8
The Gospel of John reveals that Christ is God, that He is the Creator, that in Him is life, and that this life is the light of men
The Lord Jesus Christ is the One responsible for keeping the earth in its proper position in relation to the sun
The Christ who upholds the universe and in whom all things consist upholds the relationship between a husband and his wife
We need to be unveiled to see Christ in the various books of the New Testament, in John, Romans, Colossians, Hebrews, and Revelation
Simply to see may not cost us anything, for seeing something does not necessarily mean that we have paid the price to gain it
If a sister buys food at the market, brings it home, and puts it into the refrigerator, she does not yet have the food in reality
Paul received the excellency of the knowledge of Christ and he suffered the loss of all things thereby paying the price to gain what he saw
We need to live in Christ, remain in Christ, lodge in Christ, speak in Christ, act in Christ, and move in Christ
We need to be found in Christ by the angels, by our husband or wife, and by the brothers and sisters in the church
As he was in Christ, having his being in Christ, and moving, walking, and doing everything in Christ, Paul lived out God
There are two possibilities: the first, that it follows 'to be found in Him'; and the second, that it follows the word 'faith'
Paul was found in Christ in the condition that he lived by Christ as his faith and thereby lived out God as his righteousness
His righteousness was not behavior or conduct; it was God Himself lived out of him as his righteousness by faith
Any wife who speaks according to the person of her husband is a very good wife, for she lives not by herself, but by her husband
Because Paul lived by Christ, he had the virtues of Christ, including the virtues of meekness and considerateness
Verse 9 says, 'And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness
Little by little and step by step, he came to know Christ, not only by revelation, but through his personal experience
One day, He became flesh, full of glory, grace, and reality; and of His fullness we have received grace upon grace
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He always lived a life under the death of the cross that dealt with His natural life
We need not only to gain Him, but also to live in Him and be found in Him by angels and by all those around us
In this way we know Christ, not in theory, but in our daily experience, and His virtues are lived out in our humanity
Not many Christians have a proper understanding of the power of Christ's resurrection or the fellowship of His sufferings
The New Testament clearly reveals that resurrection, especially the resurrection of Christ, is related to death
Since it is necessary to be in death in order to know the power of resurrection, we must understand what it means to be in death
For this understanding, we need to consider the record of the life of the Lord Jesus as found in the four Gospels
The Gospels are not merely an account of stories, lessons, teachings, or examples, but a record of a Person who is our life
Not only was Christ crucified when He was put on the cross; before He was put on the cross, He lived under the cross
The mystery of the Christian life is related to the fact that both Christ and we have two lives, the divine life and the human life
It will help us to understand this if we ask another question: Did God intend Christ to express His humanity or His divinity?
The answer to this question is that God wanted Christ to express divinity in His humanity by means of the divine life
Just as a husband wants himself expressed not in himself but in his wife so God desires to have Himself expressed not in Himself but in man
For the expression of God in man, two lives are needed, one life to express Him and another life to be the channel for this expression
When some hear this, they may say, 'This is not logical, for to express is to be the channel, and to be the channel is to express'
It is impossible for man's life to express God, just as it is impossible for the life of a cat to express a bird
Although the human life cannot express God, the human life is needed for the accomplishment of this expression
In order for Jesus to express God, He had to deny His human life by constantly putting it to death under the cross
As Jesus lived the crucified life, this crucified life gave the opportunity for the divine life to be lived out for the expression of God
Concerning this matter of the power of Christ's resurrection, as in so many other matters, many Christians are missing the mark
If we know the power of His resurrection every meeting of the church will be a resurrection meeting and every day will be a resurrection day
Most of the sermons preached in the so-called churches teach people to use their human life to imitate the divine life
Our goal is to dispense something divine into you so that you may live by the divine life, the only life that can express God
When we are willing for this and are placed into death, the crucified life will become the base for the resurrection life to rise up
If we had been the Lord Jesus, we would have rebuked them harshly for paying no attention to the word regarding crucifixion
When the Lord put Himself under death, this death gave the best opportunity for the divine life within Him to come forth
By the Lord's mercy and grace, we have come to know that the desire of God's heart is to express Himself through us
The Lord may give us certain helpers to assist us in this, a wife or husband, children, and the brothers and sisters in the church
To be a good brother or sister among the saints in the church life requires that we go to the cross to be crucified
As we have seen, crucifixion affords a base for the power of Christ's resurrection to rise up that the divine life may be expressed
As long as we are willing to go to the cross and to remain there, everything will be in the power of resurrection
As He was growing up and as He came into the ministry commissioned by God, He was continually under the death of the cross
He had the divine life for the purpose of expressing God and the human life for the purpose of having God expressed in man
The Lord Jesus made the decision regarding the setting aside of His human life, not by His divine life, but by His human life
The first man, Adam, was defeated; however, the second man, Jesus, came, also with a free will, and He was victorious
The entire universe, including Satan, the angels, and the demons, was watching to see what the Lord Jesus would do
In order to express God, He needed the divine life; and in order to express God in man, He needed the human life
As a man desiring to express God in His humanity, the first thing He had to do was to put His human life aside
The reason there are so many separations and divorces is that the wives are not willing to be killed by their husbands
During the three and a half years of His ministry, the Lord lived as a crucified and buried person, living always under death
As we have pointed out, the first thing the Lord Jesus did when He came out to minister was to be buried by John the Baptist
By being baptized by John, the Lord indicated that He was willing to put away His human life and to keep it always under the cross
He wanted to know Christ and the power of His resurrection by putting himself aside and living under the death of Christ
If unbelievers set themselves aside, nothing will remain, for they do not have the Spirit as the remainder in them
The way to write a check is to put yourself to death and, through death, to enter into the Spirit as the reality of resurrection
Spontaneously resurrection will be manifested in you, and you will be able to sing with joy these lines from a hymn by A
Tis not hard to die with Christ When His risen life we know; 'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings When our hearts with joy o'erflow
When the circumstances are difficult, do not feel sorry for yourself, but take up the cross and remain under the death of the cross
Immediately the Spirit, the power of resurrection, will rise up within you, and you will sing with joy, ''Tis not hard to die with Christ'
Although it is wonderful to enjoy the power of Christ's resurrection, the power of resurrection is not mainly for our enjoyment
God's intention is not to express Himself through certain individuals; it is to express Himself through a Body composed of many believers
Philippians 3:10 speaks of knowing Christ, of knowing the power of His resurrection, and then of knowing the fellowship of His sufferings
Within His great sufferings, there is a part for redemption and a part for the producing and building up of the church
During these hours, Christ became sin in the eyes of God , for God gathered all of man's sin, placed it upon Him, and condemned Him
Although we cannot share in Christ's sufferings for redemption, we can share in His sufferings for reproducing and for building up the Body
Because of this certain of your superiors oppose you, either passing you up for a promotion or causing you to be dismissed from your job
In other words, the very Christ whose life is recorded in the four Gospels lives His life again in us and in the same way
The Christ revealed in the Gospels becomes our experience, and we follow in His footsteps as He repeats His life in us
If you read the book of Acts again, you will see that Peter, James, John, Paul, and all the apostles were such people
In the Gospels Christ lived out Himself in Jesus in Acts He lived out Himself in the apostles and now He intends to live out Himself in us
We need to know Him also by enjoying Him, by experiencing Him, by being one with Him, and by having Him live within us and walk with us
Eventually, as we shall see in a forthcoming message, we shall be able to say, 'I can do all things in Him who empowers me'
The purpose of this is that we might know Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings
According to God's economy in the Old Testament, His people were required to keep the law in order to be righteous in His sight
In the New Testament God does not require us to keep the commandments of the law; rather, He has ordained that we be buried
If anyone in the New Testament economy keeps the ten commandments but refuses to be baptized, he is a rebel against God's ordination
In His New Testament economy, God wants us to be terminated in order that we might receive the One who will germinate us
In other words, in the New Testament the righteousness God requires is that we live, not by ourselves, but by God
The best wife is one who lives in the person of her husband, according to the very heart and desire of her husband
In the New Testament God sent His Son to put Himself into His people so that they might live, not by themselves, but by God
When He came out to minister, the first thing He did was to go to John the Baptist to observe God's ordination to be terminated in baptism
He was a person who kept His human life under the death of the baptism that buried his human life and resurrected Him in the divine life
Of keeping the law, He lived by God, not caring for requirements, regulations, or commandments, but only for God Himself
The Lord Jesus did not live merely according to His Father's commandments; He lived according to the Father Himself
Our human life is always under death so that we no longer have our being according to our human life, but according to Christ
As we are being conformed to Christ's death, temptations will come to induce us to live by ourselves instead of by the divine life within us
In John 12:25 the Lord Jesus said, 'He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life'
As we are in the process of being conformed to His death, we shall be tempted again and again to turn away from the crucified life
The temptations seek to induce us away from living a crucified life and to revert to living by our natural life
The more we know Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, the more we shall be conformed to His death
It is in being conformed to His death that we enjoy Christ, the divine life, and live out God as our righteousness
The death spoken of in verse 10 is not a negative death, the death of Adam, but a positive, lovable death, the death of Christ the Savior
The resurrection in verse 11 is not the ordinary resurrection, but the extraordinary resurrection, the outstanding resurrection
We shall know Christ experientially, and we shall also know the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
In John 314 the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
We have the aspect of redemption, the aspect of removing the serpentine poison, and the aspect of the multiplication of the divine life
Because we have a serpentine nature, we need Him in the form of a serpent to destroy the nature of Satan in our being
If He merely takes away our sins and our serpentine nature without imparting anything into us, we are still empty
He had performed a great miracle in raising Lazarus from the dead, and a large number of Jews believed in Him because of it
Although there was a great crowd, the question we must ask is this: Is there anything of life in this crowd, in this great following?
Not only did His death release the life of God from within Him; it also imparted it into us, making us grains of wheat just like Him
One difference between the one grain and the many is that He was willing to fall into the ground, but we are not
When we see the ripened harvest Of the golden countryside, We may know that many seeds have Fallen to the earth and died
We must care for how much life the new ones receive through our impartation, for how much life is infused into others through us
We need to be conformed to His death so that the divine life within us may be released and imparted into others
We may be able to stir up people or excite them, but what counts is how much life is in them after a number of years
In today's Christianity there are many big revivals, and thousands, even millions, of people claim to have been saved
Spontaneously the divine life within us will be released, and God the Father, the source of this life, will be glorified
In John 12:31 the Lord Jesus said, 'Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out'
God created this white shirt, but Satan has caused spots of dirt, the principalities and powers, to appear on it
The reason that Satan and the principalities and powers trouble you is that you are still wearing the 'dirty shirt'
On the day we were baptized, we should have realized that our old man, the natural man with the old life, was buried
The Epistle to the Philippians is composed in such a way that if we do not have experience, we shall have difficulty understanding it
In verse 8 Paul says that he counts all things loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord
Others, disagreeing with this view, have said that according to the context, it must refer to a present experience
It refers to the process that began on the day we were baptized and that will conclude when we arrive at the outstanding resurrection
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit of God came in to quicken our deadened spirit with the divine life
Theology may merely tell us that if a believer dies before the Lord Jesus comes back, he will eventually be resurrected from the grave
Suppose a certain brother is baptized, realizing that his natural life is being buried and that he has been quickened by the divine life
He loves the Lord and prays to the Lord with the expectation that eventually every part of him will be resurrected
He also begins to experientially know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings
As he seeks the Lord and experiences Him, he spontaneously realizes, item by item, the things in him that have been terminated
He prays and confesses this matter to the Lord, asking Him for the grace to no longer shepherd the saints according to his natural life
At least a small percentage of his being must still have been natural; it was not yet Paul the Apostle, but still Saul of Tarsus
Because he was not fully in resurrection, he was still endeavoring to arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead
My burden in this message is to point out to you that our Christian walk is a matter of death and resurrection
Paul desired to be conformed to Christ's death so that, by any means, he might arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead
We need to see the vision that God's economy is not a matter of ethics or religion, but of being conformed to the death of Christ
When you are willing to be conformed to Christ's death and are spontaneously brought into resurrection, you will meet Christ in resurrection
Whoever we are, whether we are young, middle-aged, or elderly, we all need to be conformed to the death of Christ
In our daily living we need to learn to practice one thing: To check whether we are conformed to the death of Christ before doing anything
The thing you plan to do may be very heavenly or spiritual, but in doing it you may not be heavenly or spiritual
It is not a matter of how we do a certain thing; it is a matter of who is doing it, we or Christ, the natural life or the resurrected life
Other verses prove that the out-resurrection spoken of in Philippians 3:11 is not merely a future event, but a present process
Romans 6:4 and 5 say that as we have been buried in the likeness of Christ's death, so we shall also walk in the newness of life
The Spirit who raised up Christ from among the dead will give life to our mortal body so that our body may enjoy resurrection life
In verse 16 of the same chapter he said that the outward man is being consumed but the inward man is being renewed day by day
We need to be conformed to His death so that by any means we may arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead
The unique way is to be conformed to the death of Christ so that we may attain unto the out-resurrection from among the dead
From that time onward, He has been working within us to resurrect every part of our being, our mind, emotion, and will
To experience Christ is to have Christ wrought into our being to resurrect us out of our old being into the new creation
When the New Jerusalem comes with the new heaven and the new earth, every part of our being will be a new creation
The way to become the new creation is to have our being processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new
Although the Apostle Paul was very mature when he wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, he still said that he had not yet been perfected
In other words, the more we obtain Christ, the more we are renewed and transformed from the old creation into the new creation
Paul undoubtedly was of a very strong character, both when he was Saul of Tarsus and when he was Paul the Apostle
When he was Saul of Tarsus, he persecuted the church negatively, and after he became the Apostle Paul, he persecuted Christ positively
When some hear such a word, they may say, 'It is heresy to say that we, the lovers of Christ, should persecute Him'
If we are not occupied in this way, we shall be continually occupied with the things of the past, either positive things or negative things
If you get into the spirit of Paul, you will realize how busy he was in persecuting Jesus and in compelling Him to be his enjoyment
When you are burning and are persecuting the Lord Jesus in a positive way, you have no room in your mind to think of the past
Christ is within us, but He is also before us at the end of the race as the goal that we are striving to reach
No matter how much we experience Christ today, we have not yet reached the goal of the highest enjoyment of Christ
Verse 15 says Let us therefore as many as are full grown think this and if anything otherwise ye think God shall reveal also this unto you
Regardless of what stage of life we are in, we all should think this one thing, that is, to pursue Christ to the uttermost
Some may think that Paul here is very domineering and speaks like a dictator, even telling the saints what to think
The one thing that we are to think is revealed in Philippians 3:7-15: It is Christ as our experience, enjoyment, goal, and prize
When some hear that we should think the one thing, they may ask about things such as foot-washing or speaking in tongues
Regarding matters like this, we should not either impose or oppose, because either imposing or opposing will cause difficulty
In just a few weeks problems developed over the matters of speaking in tongues and playing a tambourine in the meetings
If there was any fellowship in spirit, any comfort of love, any compassion and mercy, they were to make Paul's joy full
If we take this way, we shall maintain a good spirit in the churches for the experience and enjoyment of Christ
There is only one thing for us to do: pursue Christ and let Him become our experience, enjoyment, goal, and prize
Recently, a number of saints have testified that although they have tried to die, they have not been successful in doing so
The more light we receive from the Lord, the more we are exposed; and the more we are exposed, the more we hate our ugly self
The Lord Jesus had to die, not only on the cross, but also daily during His life on earth, and He certainly was not sinful
When He came forth to minister, the first thing He did was to present Himself to John the Baptist to be buried
If we would know how to die we need to see clearly that the reason we must die is not because we are sinful but simply because we are human
The second point concerning the way to die is that God wants us to live out not our human life, but the divine life
Romans 6:3 says, 'Or are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
The reference to Christ's being raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father indicates a glorious resurrection
As Christ was raised from among the dead in a glorious resurrection, even so we also should walk in newness of life
The one who has been resurrected to walk in newness of life is not the original you, the one who was buried; it is Christ with you
Because we are still governed by our natural concepts, we may say, 'The Bible tells us that we should walk in newness of life
When the grain is sown into the soil and remains there, sooner or later the life within the grain will rise up
If we would know how to die, we must also see that we have a powerful life within us and that this life is Christ
Corinthians 13:3 says, 'Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you'
Romans 6 says that we are baptized into Christ's death and indicates that the power of resurrection follows death
When we are willing to remain in His death, the power of resurrection will rise up within us and bring us deeper and deeper into death
Some brothers and sisters may come all the way out of death, whereas others may have one foot in death and one foot outside death
Still others may lie down in death; however, they are only partly at rest because as they lie there, they are desiring to leave death
Are you ignorant of the fact that as many of us as have been baptized into Christ have been baptized into His death?
The more death we have, the more resurrection we experience; and the more resurrection we have, the more death we experience
The Lord Jesus said, 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
These messages were not accurate, for they taught us that we had to crucify ourselves in order to be crucified with Christ
In Matthew 16:24 the Lord Jesus said, 'If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
It is a fact, not a superstition or a doctrine, that another Person, Jesus Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit, has come into our being
When what we are according to our first status is kept in the tomb, what we are according to our second status, the spirit, rises up
On the negative side we need to do three things: crucify the flesh, put to death the practices of the body, and deny the self
Like dough that is pressed into a mold, we need to be pressed into the mold of Christ's death until we are conformed to it
The Spirit will proceed to put to death all the practices of the body, including such things as our humility, love, and good intentions
Because we are not willing to put to death such practices, we bargain with the Spirit and say, 'These are very good practices
Peter made a good proposal to the Lord, but the Lord saw through the outward self and perceived that Satan was hiding there
Immediately after saying this, the Lord spoke about denying the self, the very self that is the embodiment of Satan
You may not have the strength to do it, but if you contact the Lord and are willing to go along with the Spirit, He will strengthen you
In this way we experience Christ through death and resurrection and enjoy Him as our portion in our daily life
Regarding the experience of Christ, the book of Philippians is the most wonderful Epistle in the New Testament
God is working in us both the willing and the working for His good pleasure , but we still need to work out our own salvation daily
In chapter three Paul proceeds to tell us that we need the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord
Being found in Christ, he did not have his own righteousness, but the righteousness that was God Himself lived out of him
Because he lived in this condition, he could know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His suffering
All this enabled him to be conformed to the death of Christ so that by any means he might arrive at the outresurrection from among the dead
Philippians 4:13 says that we can do all things in Him, and John 15:5 says that apart from Him we can do nothing
To be in Him is a secret, to abide in Him is a secret, and to know how to abide in Him is still another secret
According to 1 John 2:27, the way to abide in Christ is to take care of the anointing, for the anointing teaches us to abide in Him
Suppose the brothers living in a brothers' house are all very natural and talk with one another in a natural way
That brief word is the teaching of the anointing, which is nothing less than the living and the working of the indwelling Christ
Instead of this, in your talking too often there are two persons with two different livings instead of two persons with one living
As you are about to talk about a certain brother, the Lord, who does not want to talk, moves within you to give you a certain feeling
Although the Lord does not want to talk, you proceed to talk anyway, sometimes gossiping for more than an hour
When Christ was on the cross, He was tempted to prove that He was the Son of God by coming down from the cross
Although we cannot keep ourselves on the cross, within us there is the power of resurrection, and by this power we can stay on the cross
In this regard we need to remember Romans 8:13, which says that by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body
Resurrection brings us into death, and death ushers us into higher resurrection, even the outstanding resurrection
Our natural life, desires, intentions, and tendencies are crucified, not by ourselves, but by the indwelling Spirit
By taking care of the inner anointing, we abide in Him; by abiding in Him, we are in Him; and by being in Him we can do all things
Although we have seen these five secrets, we must still consider a sixth the secret of how to enjoy the indwelling Spirit
We have seen that we in ourselves are not able to stay on the cross; instead, we often come down from the cross
In 1 Thessalonians 5 the word 'rejoice' is modified by the word 'evermore,' and the word 'pray' by the words 'without ceasing'
Although we have this Spirit within us, the Spirit is often choked because we do not rejoice, pray, or give thanks
In so many other things we should not be legal, but when it comes to eating, drinking, breathing, and sleeping, we must be legal
We tried our best to convince her to eat, telling her that we were concerned that she would die if she continued to go without eating
By this burning Spirit within, we shall be willing to remain in death and to keep the flesh, the self, and the natural life on the cross
The way to have such an outstanding death is to rejoice always, to pray unceasingly, and to give thanks in everything
If we do these things, the Spirit will work out the experience of death, and this death will bring us into resurrection
