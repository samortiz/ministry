   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Eight A New Creation in Christ Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 5:17; 4:16; Gal 6:15 As believers in Christ, we have been made a new creation 2 Cor 5:17: The most crucial matter in God s full, all-inclusive salvation is His making us a new creation in Christ Gal 6:15.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The term new creation is an expression conveying the plain and real fact that we have been saved to be made a new creation 2 Cor 6:2; 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Like the old creation, the new creation is corporate; in the new creation we all are parts of the new man, the church, composed of the many sons of God Eph 2:15; 1:5; Heb 2:10-12.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s eternal purpose is not just to redeem, to repossess, the fallen old creation but to regenerate man to make him the new creation John 3:3; 1:12-13; 2 Cor 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are a new creation through our organic union with Christ v. 17: To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and nature; this is of God through our faith in Christ 1 Cor 1:30; Gal 3:26-28.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Apart from this organic union, we remain in the old creation, but by the organic union with the Triune God in Christ, we are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The new creation is a person regenerated with the life of God and living in the inner man, not in the outer man John 3:3, 5-6, 15; 2 Cor 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is a basic difference between the old creation and the new creation Gen 1:1; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15; Rev 21:2: The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation has God within it as its life, nature, appearance, and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The old creation as an empty vessel has no content of God, but the new creation as a corporate vessel has God as its content Eph 1:22-23; 3:19b.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The old creation was old because God was not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it 4:22-24.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s goal is to produce the new creation out of the old creation; the new creation is the old creation transformed by the divine life 2 Cor 3:18.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The new creation the mingling of God with man takes place when the Triune God in Christ as the Spirit is wrought into our being; this is the mingling of divinity with humanity 1 Cor 6:17; Eph 3:16-17a.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem is new because, as God s new creation, it has God s nature of newness Rev 21:2, 5a: Since newness is God, to become new is to become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead by having God wrought into us Rom 6:4; 7:6; Eph 4:23-24.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of the realm of newness, which is Christ 2 Cor 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ dealt with the problem of the old creation through His crucifixion, His all-inclusive death on the cross Luke 23:44-46; Heb 10:20; Exo 26:31: The main item terminated by the death of Christ was the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Christ died on the cross as the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 , His death terminated the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the sight of God, the entire old creation was crucified with Christ and buried with Him cf.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>John 20:5.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The new creation comes into being by resurrection 2 Cor 5:17; 1 Cor 15:20, 23, 45: In His work in His resurrection, Christ rose up on the first day of the week to germinate the new creation John 20:1: The fact that Christ rose on the first day indicates that the universe had a new beginning in Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whereas the Lord s death was the termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the old creation is germinated with the divine life, it becomes the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b: In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit to germinate some of those in the old creation to be the new creation John 20:17.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians 15:45 implies the old creation with the soul as the center and the new creation with the Spirit as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The life-giving Spirit is the center and lifeline of the new creation v. 45b; 2 Cor 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are made a new creation by being regenerated 1 Pet 1:3; John 3:6: Regeneration causes us to become a new creation, something which has the element of God within it 1:12-13; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>36:26.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regeneration causes us to have God s life and element, thereby making us a new creation 2 Pet 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our experience we are in the process of becoming a new creation by being broken and renewed 2 Cor 5:17; 4:10-12, 16; Eph 4:23-24: Although our spirit has been regenerated, our soul with its faculties of mind, will, and emotion remains in the old creation and needs to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be renewed is to have God s ever-new essence dispensed into us to replace and discharge our old element 2 Cor 4:16; Rom 12:2; Titus 3:5.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through the process of renewing, we are transferred from the realm of the old creation into the realm of the new creation to become the New Jerusalem Col 3:10; Rev 21:2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to overcome the old creation by living in the ascension of Christ in resurrection S. S. 2:8-13; 4:6-9; 6:10a: The physical things are part of the old creation; if we desire the physical things of the world, we are living in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A Christian who lives in the old creation cares for physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The old man cares for physical things, but we should be the new man living in ascension as God s new creation in resurrection Eph 4:22, 24; 2:4-6.</S>
