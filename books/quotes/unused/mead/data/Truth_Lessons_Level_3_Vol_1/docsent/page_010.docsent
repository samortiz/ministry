   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Nature as Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eve received her life from Adam; she was the bone of Adam s bone and the flesh of Adam s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, she had the same character, life, and nature as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In like manner, the church comes out of Christ and has the same character, life, and nature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in this respect Eve is a type of the church, which has the same character, life, and nature as Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eve not only came out of Adam but also was brought to Adam Gen 2:22 to be joined to Adam and to become one flesh with Adam v. 24 . In like manner, the church is joined to Christ and becomes one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only Eve, who came out of Adam, could be joined to Adam; likewise, only the church, which comes out of Christ, can be joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As Adam and Eve were joined to become one complete unit, Christ and the church are also joined to become one complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, Adam and Eve were joined to become one flesh, whereas Christ and the church are joined to become one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>D. Which Becomes the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>to Be His Counterpart</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eve was a part of Adam s body as Adam s counterpart, typifying that the church is Christ s Body as Christ s counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 1:22b-23a says, The church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ s Body is not an organization but an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church is this organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, the church as the Body is also the counterpart of Christ Eph 5:31-32 to match and complement Him completely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As His Reproduction</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church comes out of Christ and has the same character, life, and nature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the church there is only Christ and there is no element other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the church is Christ s reproduction, Christ s duplication.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As His Multiplication</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Eve was Adam s multiplication, the church is Christ s multiplication produced through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ was the unique grain that fell into the ground and died, and in resurrection He brought forth many grains John 12:24 , that is, many believers, to constitute the church as the Body of Christ to be His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As His Increase</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As Eve was Adam s increase, the church is Christ s increase.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John 3 shows that Christ is immeasurable and unlimited vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>31-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a One needs a universal increase to be His bride to match Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, God first regenerates us through His Spirit vv.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As His Fullness</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Just as Eve became the fullness of Adam, the church becomes the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 1:23 shows us that Christ is the One who fills all in all and that the church is His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ, who is the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As His Expression</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just as Eve was Adam s expression, the church is Christ s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fullness does not refer to the riches of what Christ is; it refers to the expression of those riches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we enjoy the riches of Christ, we become His fullness that He may have a full expression.</S>
