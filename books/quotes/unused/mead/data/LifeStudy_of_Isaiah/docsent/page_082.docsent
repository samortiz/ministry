   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE SEVENTEEN JEHOVAH'S DEALING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH ISRAEL'S RELIANCE ON EGYPT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>HIS DEALING WITH THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ISSUING IN ISRAEL'S TURN TO HIM</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>AND IN HIS RETURN TO ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>WITH THE RESTORATION Scripture Reading: Isa 30 31</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaiah had a divine way of thinking, a divine philosophy, within him when he wrote his book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This divine philosophy included God's chastisement of Israel, His judgment upon the nations, the restoration of Israel, the restoration of the created yet fallen things, and the ushering in of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At first, God "hired" Israel to be His testimony, His witness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But Israel failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then God hired the many nations around Israel to chastise His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, they did not do this according to what God had in His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They chastised Israel excessively, and this offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, God came in to "fire" both the children of Israel and the surrounding nations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This matter was deeply impressed upon Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's chastisement of Israel and His judgment upon the nations who exercised excessive action upon Israel issues in three things: 1 Israel is brought back to God; 2 the created things are restored; and 3 the all-inclusive Christ is ushered in. The restoration of the created yet fallen things goes along with Israel's return to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God intends to restore the created and fallen things, but there is the need for Israel to usher in this restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Israel turns to God, there will be the restoration of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the all-inclusive Christ will be ushered in. This is the divine philosophy in the book of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This divine philosophy applies to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter who we are and what our race, culture, or nationality may be, we all are utter failures as far as God is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of realization will cause us to turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our success never causes us to turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when we look at our failures, we are humbled, we realize that we have a need, and we repent, confessing that we are hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although we may not know what we need, we know that we need something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, the all-inclusive Christ comes in to meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Especially in the first thirty-nine chapters of his prophecy, Isaiah's thought is focused on God's chastisement issuing in a return to God and bringing in the restoration and the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the logic, the spiritual and heavenly philosophy, that dominates the book of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although this is not clearly written, it is nevertheless the basic and governing principle of Isaiah's writing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that we will all see this crucial matter and keep it in mind as we turn to chapters thirty and thirty-one, where we will see that Jehovah's dealing with Israel's reliance on Egypt and His dealing with the nations issue in Israel's turn to Him and in His return to Israel with the restoration.</S>
