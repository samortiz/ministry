   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CAMPUS WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are hoping that the Lord can raise up a number of young people who are bilingual to go full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These ones would be useful to go and visit all of the campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Also, if the Lord wills, we will have summer conferences and training centers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The full-time ones could go to visit the campuses to work on the "farms."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When summer comes, the school terms will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then all these ones who are reaped will probably be able to give two weeks to attend a conference plus a training concerning the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These would then go back to the campuses as seeds which are sown to grow into another harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We also hope that we could have a long period of training of maybe two or three months to train the ones who are willing to bear some responsibility in the Chinese-speaking work and in the Chinese-speaking meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Also, all the full-timers need this kind of training.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because of this situation, we felt that it might be very profitable to have some houses close to the major campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We could call a certain house near a campus "the Chinese student center."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not need to use the word Christian in referring to the student center because we accept the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of Chinese student center would help the new ones coming from Hong Kong and mostly from Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are new in the United States and they do not know where to go or what to do practically.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With such a center near a campus, we will have some way to help them and to lodge them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spontaneously, the host of this house would be able to render some help to them in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This will give the Lord a way to reap many.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I feel that this is a golden time for us to go on with the Lord in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we could do something for His move today on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This work will also exercise a great effect on the English-speaking community.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all need to pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE LORD'S SOVEREIGNTY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord is really sovereign in the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Due to the political change in mainland China, a number of Chinese fled to Taiwan and we were among them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord did a marvelous work on that island.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Within ten years the Lord gained about fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The reason why we could have over one thousand Chinese-speaking saints in a conference is because of this source of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fact that the number of Chinese immigrants to the United States has been increased from twenty-thousand to forty-thousand is another factor for the Lord's move.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is all sovereign of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Chinese come yearly to the United States and among these are many of the dear saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord has sovereignly prepared these ones for coming to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe that one by one they all will become a strengthening to the Lord's recovery in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Again, this is something really sovereign of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE RECOVERY OF THE LOST ONES</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among the Chinese immigrants who are living in the United States, quite a few thousand came from the source of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Among these, only about two thousand are now in the local churches in the United States and Canada.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are hoping that through this Chinese-speaking work, many of them will be brought back to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some have already come back within this past year.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is also something for which we need to pray.</S>
