   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 13 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matt 13:31-33 ...The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, and which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Three Aspects of</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>the Kingdom of the Heavens continued</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Following the parable of the tares, the second item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed in the parable of the mustard seed growing abnormally into a tree Matt 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mustard is an herb, not a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>250 The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb that produces food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, its nature and function were changed, so that it became a tree, a lodging place for birds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is against the law of God s creation, that is, that every plant must be after its kind Gen 1:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This change happened in the first part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church....The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree in the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This resulted in the formation of the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the birds in the first parable signify the evil one, Satan Matt 13:4, 19 , the birds of heaven in verse 32 must refer to Satan s evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They lodge in the branches of the great tree, that is, in the enterprises of Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>251</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The third item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed in the parable of leaven taken by a woman and hidden in three measures of meal Matt 13:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>252 In the Scriptures leaven signifies evil things 1 Cor 5:6-8 and evil doctrines Matt 16:6, 11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>253 What is leaven?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Leaven is something which is added to flour to make the bread enjoyable and easy to take.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>254 Once the flour is leavened there is no way to purge it, no way to purify it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all must realize that we are still under a certain kind or a certain extent of leavening.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the truths we have heard and received in the past have been leavened by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>255</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content, must be a loaf of unleavened bread 1 Cor 5:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified by the woman in Matthew 13:33 , took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This mixture became the corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Meal, for making the meal offering Lev 2:1 , signifies Christ as food to both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal Gen 18:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, the hiding of the leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the actual situation in the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering Lev 2:4-5, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>256</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whereas everything in Matthew 5, 6, and 7 is real, pure, spiritual, and heavenly, everything shown in Matthew 13 is false, corrupt, mixed, and abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>257</S>
