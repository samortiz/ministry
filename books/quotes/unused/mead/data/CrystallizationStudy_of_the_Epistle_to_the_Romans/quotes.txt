[1]  Crystallization-Study of the Epistle to the Romans CONTENTS
[2]  The Essence of the Person of Jesus Christ the God-man
[3]  This gospel is concerning Jesus Christ the God-man; hence, Jesus Christ the God-man is the center of the good news and the glad tidings of God to men.
[4]  The entire book, from chapter one on the person of Jesus Christ the God-man and on the righteousness of God to chapter sixteen on the local churches as the expression of the Body of Christ, is the gospel, the good news and the glad tidings Rom 10:15 , of God to men in its completeness.
[5]  Do not think that only the first four chapters of Romans on justification by faith are the gospel of God.
[6]  JESUS CHRIST THE GOD-MAN A. The Person of Jesus Christ the God-man
[7]  Jesus Christ the God-man 2 The Essence of the Work of Jesus Christ the God-man Scripture Reading: Rom 1:3-4 OUTLINE The center of the gospel of God Jesus Christ the God-man 1:3-4: The work of Jesus Christ the God-man: The preliminary steps: His incarnation, implied in His becoming the seed of David 1:3 John 1:1, 14: 1 The eternal God, the complete God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit , came: a From eternity into time. b In the Triune God s divinity.
[8]  2 To be the flesh: a In its likeness but without sin Rom 8:3b . b Partaking of the human blood and flesh in which Satan with sin is involved Heb 2:14 .
[9]  4 To be the God-man in the universe, as a model, a prototype, for the mass reproduction of many sons of God, for the accomplishment of God s eternal economy 1 Tim 1:4b : a A particular item in the universe which has never been seen in God s old creation. b This item is the initiation of God s new creation.
[10]  His human living, implied in His being a man living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years Rom 5:15, 17, 19 : 1 A living of obeying God Rom 5:19; Phil 2:8; John 6:38.
[11]  2 He took away the sin of the world John 1:29: a Bearing the transgressions and iniquities of God s chosen people Isa 53:5-6. b Dying for the sins of the believers by bearing their sins the outward sins in their conduct on the cross 1 Cor 15:3; 1 Pet 2:24. c Condemning the inward sin brought by Satan into man s flesh in the flesh Rom 8:3b. d For the believers redemption and justification Rom 3:23-26. e For the healing of the diseases of God s people Isa 53:4-5; 1 Pet 2:24. f Accomplishing God s eternal redemption Heb 9:12.
[12]  4 He regenerated His believers in His resurrection with Him in one great, corporate birth to be the many sons of God and His many brothers 1 Pet 1:3; Heb 2:10-12; John 20:17 , who, as the many sons of God, are to be conformed to the image of Him as the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .
[13]  In the meantime, He, as the ascended Lord of all, as the consummated and ascended God-man and as the Head of the Body, intercedes at the right hand of God in the heavens for us that we, His many brothers and members, who are the many God-men, could overcome the oppositions and any kind of circumstances and be kept in union with Him in His unconditional love, so that we may be conformed to the image of Him, the firstborn Son of God, as the prototype, to be His consummated mass reproduction for the constitution of His corporate and organic Body Rom 8:29-39 .
[14]  Thus, His earthly ministry up to the end of His resurrection produced the many sons of God who are His many brothers as the constituents for the building up of His Body; and His heavenly ministry, from His ascension to His second coming, ministers the divine life to His members that they may grow unto maturity, unto the redemption of their body, the glorification of God s redeemed people, and keeps all His members in union with Him that they may be conformed to the image of Him as the prototype for the mass reproduction of Him for the carrying out of God s eternal economy.
[15]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You for Your presence all the time.
[16]  You are the Spirit, so You are present with us all the time.
[17]  Your presence means everything to us in our life and in our work.
[18]  B. The Work of Jesus Christ the God-man 1.
[19]  Christ s ministry is first, on the earth and second, in the heavens.
[20]  In His heavenly ministry, He, as the pneumatic Christ, the pneumatized Christ, the Spirit of life, indwells us in the heavenlies to give life to our mortal bodies Rom 8:2-16 to minister the divine life of the processed and consummated God into us, the dying ones signified by mortal bodies , for the building up of the Body of Christ which will consummate in the New Jerusalem for the accomplishing of the eternal economy of God.
[21]  3 An Additional Word concerning the Essence of the Person and Work of Jesus Christ the God-man Scripture Reading: Rom 1:3-4
[22]  I would like to present a very important sketch on the first two messages we have covered concerning the center of the gospel of God.
[23]  Now we want to consider the element of Christ s divinity.
[24]  Christ as God is divine, but it is difficult to understand the involvement of Christ s divinity.
[25]  The divinity of Christ is involved with His being two kinds of Sons of God.
[26]  the Dynamic Salvation of God in Its Fullness The Essence of the Particular Items
[27]  of God s Dynamic Salvation Scripture Reading: Rom 1:16 OUTLINE The gospel of God is dynamic powerful to save all the sinners who would believe in it Rom 1:16: To redeem them: Judicially.
[28]  TO SAVE ALL THE SINNERS WHO WOULD BELIEVE IN IT
[29]  God s salvation is not only to redeem us but also to save us.
[30]  We were redeemed judicially by the blood of Christ, but we are saved organically by the life of Christ Rom 5:10b .
[31]  We should not say that God saved us by His blood.
[32]  1 The Essence of the Righteousness of God Scripture Reading: Rom 1:16-17 OUTLINE The righteousness of God: Romans 1:17 says, The righteous shall have life and live by faith.
[33]  According to the divine revelation as presented to us in the book of Romans, the structure of the gospel of God is of the righteousness of God, the life of Christ, and the faith of the believers.
[34]  God s justification by His grace freely is the means for God to fulfill His purpose that He may give His life to His chosen people to make them like Him in His life and nature.
[35]  Christ is the end of the law by fulfilling all the requirements of God s righteousness, holiness, and glory, and is made judicially the righteousness from God to the believers Rom 10:4; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:9: There are two aspects of Christ being righteousness from God to the believers: The first aspect to be the believers righteousness for them to be justified before God objectively at the time of their repenting unto God and believing into Christ Rom 3:24-26; Acts 13:39; Gal 3:24b, 27.
[36]  The crystallization in this message is concerning the essence of the righteousness of God.
[37]  A. The Key Word concerning the Gospel of God
[38]  The lawkeepers attempt to keep the law for the building up of their own righteousness Rom 9:31 .
[39]  But out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before God Rom 3:20 .
[40]  2 The Essence of the Life of Christ Scripture Reading: Rom 1:16-17 OUTLINE The life of Christ: Romans 5:10 says, For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.
[41]  It unveils to us that the full salvation of God is of two sections: The first is the section of foundation: By the redemption of Christ judicially.
[42]  I would like to point out the first verse of Hymns, #483, which says:
[43]  A. A Key Word of the Book of Romans
[44]  Being reconciled to God through the death of His Son is by the judicial redemption of Christ.
[45]  Now we want to see what the life of Christ, as the continuation of God s building, has accomplished for us.
[46]  Also, this life makes the God-justified believers the many sons of God Rom 8:14; Heb 2:10 , who are the many brothers of Christ Rom 8:29 through regeneration 1 Pet 1:3 by the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 with Christ s producing and multiplying life.
[47]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Seven The Structure of the Gospel of God
[48]  1 Scripture Reading: John 3:15, 36; Gal 2:20, 16; 3:22, 26; Rom 3:22; Heb 11:6 OUTLINE The faith of the believers: The word faith bears two denotations: The first denotation refers to the things the believers believe in; it is the objective faith Eph 4:13; 1 Tim 1:19b; 2 Tim 4:7.
[49]  The faith of the believers is actually not their own faith but Christ entering into them to be their faith Rom 3:22 and note 1; Gal 2:16 and note 1: When they repent unto God, the pneumatic Christ as the sanctifying Spirit of God 1 Pet 1:2a moves within them to be their faith by which they believe on the Lord Jesus Acts 16:31 .
[50]  I use the phrase the faith of the believers because the unbelieving sinners do not have faith.
[51]  Hence, this all-inclusive Christ is not only the center but also the structure of the dynamic salvation of God.
[52]  All the three refer to God Himself who calls the things not being as being and gives life to the dead Rom 4:17 embodied in Christ and realized in the Spirit, so the faith is the faith of Christ Gal 2:20, 16; 3:22, 26; Rom 3:22.
[53]  Hebrews 11:1 says, Faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
[54]  This is the apostle Paul s definition of faith.
[55]  In Greek the word for substantiation is the same as the word for substance.
[56]  In Hebrews 1:3 Paul refers to Christ as the impress of God s substance.
[57]  In Matthew 17:20b the Lord spoke concerning the effect of faith: If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.
[58]  The believers are the believing ones in Christ, who are the household of faith Gal 6:10 .
[59]  In the universe there are many houses with many households.
[60]  But there is one particular house with millions of members.
[61]  The believers live Christ by this faith as defined in the preceding items , the faith of Christ, the Son of God Gal 2:20b .
[62]  So Paul said in Galatians 2:20 that the life that he lived, he lived by faith, the faith of Jesus the Son of God.
[63]  It was as if Paul were saying, I live Christ not by my faith, but by the faith of Jesus the Son of God; that is not my faith, but His faith.
[64]  Hebrews 12:2 says that we need to look away to Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith.
[65]  We need to look away from everything other than Jesus.
[66]  I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God Gal 2:20.
[67]  By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God both salvation and faith are of the gift of God Eph 2:8.
[68]  Romans 1:17 says, "The righteous shall have life and live by faith."
[69]  We not only have life but also live by faith.
[70]  According to 2 Peter 1:1, such a linking faith is the God-allotted faith.
[71]  No doubt, Peter said this in light of the Old Testament type of the good land.
[72]  In the Old Testament, when the children of Israel entered into the good land, Joshua allotted the good land under God s leading Josh 13:6 .
[73]  T. God Apportioning to Each a Measure of Faith
[74]  Romans 12:3 says, Not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith.
[75]  If you think you are bigger than Paul in the quantity of faith, you are crazy.
[76]  Rev 20:4, 6; Matt 25:21, 23 OUTLINE The faith of the believers: Faith is the first issue of the Lord s superabounding grace 1 Tim 1:14: The superabounding grace of the Lord is the processed and consummated Triune God to be within us our enjoyment of the divine unsearchable riches in Christ John 1:17; Eph 3:8.
[77]  First Timothy 1:14 says, And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
[78]  Faith is the first issue of the Lord s superabounding grace.
[79]  The first issue of the Lord s superabounding grace is faith that links us to the unsearchable riches of the Divine Trinity and which is the source of all the virtues of a believer Eph 3:17a .
[80]  The linking faith is the divine requirement for the overcomers to meet Christ in His triumphant return.
[81]  This is based upon Luke 18:8, where the Lord said, When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?
[82]  Such a faith is the indicator of the living of the Christ-pursuing God-man, which is the real expression of the consummated God in Christ as His embodiment for the building up of the organic Body of Christ to be the organism of the consummated Triune God.
[83]  By this linking faith we are linked to God in Christ to participate in all that the all-inclusive Christ is, has, and has attained to, for the producing of the organic members of Christ to constitute and build up His organic Body, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the enlargement and expression of the eternal Triune God in His unlimited glory in the mysterious mingling of divinity with humanity for eternity Rev 21:2 22:5 .
[84]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Twelve The Divine Transfer of the Believers
[85]  We became sinners before God with sin in our nature Rom 3:23; 7:17.
[86]  We became God s enemies by following God s enemy, Satan Rom 5:10a; 8:7; Eph 2:2.
[87]  We are sanctified by the Spirit of life with the element of the divine nature Rom 15:16 , renewed from the oldness of our old man by the Spirit of life Rom 12:2b; Titus 3:5 , transformed by the Lord Spirit with the life element of Christ Rom 12:2b; 2 Cor 3:18 , conformed through the transformation in life to the image of the firstborn Son of God, making us the many God-men, the mass reproduction of Christ the God-man, the prototype Rom 8:29 , and glorified to be completely redeemed in our body, the framework of our entire being, for the full enjoyment of our divine sonship Rom 8:30, 23 .
[88]  I. THE BELIEVERS OF CHRIST BEING BORN IN ADAM
[89]  We, the believers of Christ, were born in Adam in our natural birth with all his involvements.
[90]  No child of Adam was born before Adam s fall, so everyone who is a descendant of Adam is in the fallen man.
[91]  We are regenerated in Christ in resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 ; in this rebirth the divine transfer takes place and transfers us out of Adam into Christ.
[92]  Once we were in Adam, but today we are in Christ.
[93]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Thirteen The Spirit of Life
[94]  3:10; 6:34; 11:29 , and the Holy Spirit in the preparation for the incarnation of Christ as the embodiment of God Luke 1:15, 35; Matt 1:18 .
[95]  Note: In the New Testament the Holy Spirit is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God.
[96]  John 7:39 says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified : The Lord s word here unveils to us a very strange aspect concerning the Spirit of God; that is, before His glorification, before His resurrection Luke 24:26 , the Spirit was not yet, even though the Third of the Divine Trinity as the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit was there already.
[97]  Jesus Christ is the God-man; He is both divine and human; hence, the Spirit of Jesus Christ must possess both the element of divinity and the element of humanity.
[98]  And just so the Spirit of God as poured out at Pentecost was indeed something new....When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the Incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus....
[99]  This thought opens up to us further the reason why it is not the Spirit of God as such, but the Spirit of Jesus, that could be sent to dwell in us....Christ came...to bring human nature itself again into the fellowship of the Divine life, to make us partakers of the Divine nature....In His own person, having become flesh, He had to sanctify the flesh, and make it a meet and willing receptacle for the indwelling of the Spirit of God....From His nature, as it was glorified in the resurrection and ascension, His Spirit came forth as the Spirit of His human life, glorified into the union with the Divine, to make us partakers of all that He had personally wrought out and acquired, of Himself and His glorified life....And in virtue of His having perfected in Himself a new holy human nature on our behalf, He could now communicate what previously had no existence a life at once human and Divine....
[100]  And the Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man....He can now come down to witness of the perfect union of the Divine and the human, and in becoming our life, to make us partakers of it....
[101]  I. THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THE SPIRIT OF JEHOVAH,
[102]  Now the Spirit of Jesus Christ is not only the Spirit of divinity but also the Spirit of humanity.
[103]  He, as the Spirit of God, has been compounded with divinity and humanity.
[104]  In typology, the type of the holy anointing ointment, as unveiled in Exodus 30:23-28, confirms this divine revelation concerning the Spirit of God.
[105]  That type shows us that the Spirit of God is compounded not only with the divinity of God typified by a hin of olive oil and the humanity of man typified by the four kinds of spices , but also with the sweet death of Christ typified by myrrh , the sweet effectiveness of the death of Christ typified by cinnamon , the surpassing resurrection of Christ typified by calamus , and the repelling power of the resurrection of Christ typified by cassia .
[106]  Such a compound was called the holy anointing ointment with which all the tabernacle and its utensils were anointed for their sanctification unto God, and such a compounded Spirit is the anointing Spirit as the sealing Spirit 2 Cor 1:21-22 , whose anointing within the believers is the reality of His indwelling within the believers 1 John 2:20, 27 .
[107]  Through Christ s death and resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Man compounded with four things: Christ s death, the sweet effectiveness of Christ s death, Christ s resurrection, and the repelling power of Christ s resurrection.
[108]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Fourteen The Spirit of Life
[109]  2 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2 OUTLINE John 7:39 says, The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified : This compound Spirit, as the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , carries out the dynamic salvation of God organically in regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation, as we have seen in the past messages.
[110]  In all these aspects the all-inclusive Spirit, as the life-giving Spirit, gives, imparts, dispenses, and distributes the divine life into the believers.
[111]  This becomes the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for the believers to live Christ and magnify Christ Phil 1:19-21 and to practice the church life as unveiled in the last five chapters of Romans concerning the Body of Christ and the local churches.
[112]  This is evidenced by Romans 14:17, which says that the righteousness, peace, and joy of such an all-inclusive Spirit are the reality of the kingdom of God in the church life.
[113]  Such an all-inclusive Spirit, as the Spirit of life, becomes the seven Spirits of God in the dark age of the church in its degradation.
[114]  This processed Spirit eventually becomes the realization of Christ, the application of the pneumatized Christ, the pneumatic Christ in the believers experience of Him, and the ultimate consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God as the reality of the divine resurrection of Christ in God s new creation.
[115]  This processed all-inclusive Spirit, as the processed and consummated Triune God, marries the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man, and they send a proclamation, as the proclamation of the consummated Triune God with His bride, the church, to the ones who are thirsty for the water of life Rev 22:17 .
[116]  The two become a universal couple to be the union of God and man, a mutual habitation of God and man, and the expression of the mingling of God and man in its expansion as the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.
[117]  Regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation are the five major steps of God s dynamic salvation.
[118]  Today many Christians appreciate the Nicene Creed, put forth at the Council of Nicaea in A.D. 325.
[119]  This creed is still recited weekly on Sunday morning in many places.
[120]  1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; 2:7; Prov 20:27; 1 Thes 5:23; John 4:24; Rom 1:9; 7:6b; 8:4b-6, 9-11, 15-16; 12:11; Heb 4:12 OUTLINE Man was created by God in three parts Gen 1:26; 1 Thes 5:23: A body made of dust as man s outward shell, the framework of man Gen 2:7a.
[121]  A spirit produced of the breath of the life of God breathed into the nostrils of man Gen 2:7b; Prov 20:27.
[122]  A soul, the issue of the combination of the breath of God with the body of dust Gen 2:7c.
[123]  I. MAN BEING CREATED BY GOD IN THREE PARTS A. A Body Made of Dust as Man s Outward Shell,
[124]  Man was created by God in three parts Gen 1:26; 1 Thes 5:23 .
[125]  Man s body made of dust is his outward shell, his framework Gen 2:7a .
[126]  IN RELATION TO THEIR EXPERIENCE OF GOD A. Elihu
[127]  Elihu realized that there is a spirit in man which is the reality of man before God Job 32:8, 18 .
[128]  In the Old Testament, David realized that in order to enjoy God s salvation, we need a willing spirit.
[129]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Sixteen The Human Spirit of the Believers
[130]  9-11, 15-16; 12:11; Heb 4:12 OUTLINE The spirit of John the apostle in seeing the four great visions, as the contents of the last book of the Bible, concludes the holy Scripture in the consummation of the New Jerusalem for the fulfillment of God s eternal economy.
[131]  The discernment of the spirit from the soul: The spirit and the soul of man are not synonyms of the same one thing; they are two distinct parts of man s composition and can be distinctly divided one from the other.
[132]  For the New Testament believers to experience Christ for the producing and building up of His organic Body in the consummation of the New Jerusalem for the accomplishment of the eternal economy of God, they need to discern their spirit from their soul Heb 4:12: In God s old creation, the spirit of man was the reality of man, and the soul of man was the person of man.
[133]  In God s new creation, the spirit of the believers becomes their person, and their soul becomes their inner organ, as their body is their outer organ; they are a spiritual man according to their regenerated spirit with their soul as their inner organ, which is considered as the psychological part of man, and with their body as their outer organ, which is considered as the physical part of man.
[134]  In God s New Testament economy the believers should live, walk, and have their being according to their spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit of God Rom 8:4b, 2 and only use their soul as their inner organ for them to live as a human being, as they use their body as their outer organ for them to do things outwardly, but they should deny and reject their soul as their person Matt 16:24-25; Luke 9:23-24 .
[135]  The concluding word the book of Romans, as a book on the organic and dynamic salvation of God in Christ, not only presents us a full and detailed definition of God s dynamic salvation but also gives us the way God takes to execute His dynamic salvation and apply it to the fallen sinners and the way the sinners should take for them to receive, experience, and enjoy God s dynamic salvation.
[136]  We all have to know these two spirits in the divine enlightenment that we may enter, by the Spirit of life in our regenerated spirit which is mingled with the Spirit of life, into the intrinsic essence of the dynamic salvation of God in Christ, which is the Triune God processed and consummated to be our eternal inheritance for our enjoyment.
[137]  V. THE SPIRIT OF JOHN THE APOSTLE IN SEEING
[138]  We all have to realize that to be a genuine believer as a God-man, to live a life for the church as the Body of Christ so that Christ can come back to consummate the New Jerusalem, our human spirit is needed.
[139]  The believers need to discern their spirit from their soul by the living, operative, and sharp word of God Heb 4:12 .
[140]  God s word always puts down our soul and uplifts our spirit.
[141]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Seventeen The Most Marvelous, Excellent, Mysterious, and
[142]  Making God contactable, touchable, receivable, experienceable, enterable, and enjoyable.
[143]  He became a God-man: Bringing divinity into humanity.
[144]  The Triune God became a God-man, bringing divinity into humanity and mingling divinity with humanity as a prototype for the mass reproduction of many God-men.
[145]  The very God who was in eternity became, through transformation, the very embodiment of the Triune God which is typified by the tabernacle, a solid entity for people to contact, to touch, to receive, to experience, to enter into, and to enjoy.
[146]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Eighteen The Designation of Christ s Humanity Scripture Reading: Rom 1:3-4; 8:29, 19; Heb 2:10-12; 1:6; 1 Pet 3:18 OUTLINE Christ s two natures, divine and human: Christ s human nature His humanity: According to the flesh, Christ is out of the seed of David to be the Son of Man Rom 1:3; John 3:14.
[147]  Bearing the likeness of the serpent the likeness of the flesh of sin , without the poison of the serpent Rom 8:3b.
[148]  Christ s divine nature His divinity: According to the Spirit of holiness, Christ is designated the Son of God Rom 1:4.
[149]  Christ s death 1 Pet 3:18: For sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring His believers to God.
[150]  In this Spirit, Christ went and proclaimed to the fallen angels in prison probably the victory of God over Satan their leader through the incarnation of God in Christ and Christ s death in the flesh 1 Pet 3:19.
[151]  The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in v. 3.
[152]  As the flesh in v. 3 refers to the human nature of Christ in the flesh, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God but to the divine essence of Christ.
[153]  This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself John 4:24 , the divinity of Christ, is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy.
[154]  Not the Holy Spirit but the Spirit as Christ s divine essence Rom 1:4; cf.
[155]  His Spirit as His divinity did not die at the cross when His flesh died; rather, His Spirit as His divinity was made alive, enlivened, with new power of life, so that in this empowered Spirit as His divinity He made a proclamation to the fallen angels after His death in the flesh and before His resurrection.
[156]  This was typified by the bronze serpent spoken of in Numbers 21:4-9.
[157]  In John 3:14 the Lord Jesus Himself said, As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.
[158]  Romans 1:4 says that Christ s humanity was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead.
[159]  Here the Spirit of holiness is different from the Holy Spirit.
[160]  In the Divine Trinity there are three Persons, and the third One is the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit in Romans 1:4 is the same as that mentioned in John 4:24, where the Lord Jesus said, God is Spirit.
[161]  First Peter 3:18 says, For Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit.
[162]  But here Peter said that Christ died for the purpose of bringing His believers to God.
[163]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Nineteen The Grace of God
[164]  1 OUTLINE Among the eight writers who participated in the unveiling of the divine revelation in the New Testament concerning the grace of God, three are particular, that is, John, Paul, and Peter.
[165]  In John s writings: In the unveiling of God the Father being life in the Son as the Spirit to the believers, John begins his writings with the grace which came with Christ in His incarnation John 1:14-17 and ends with the grace as the consummation not only of his writings but also of the entire Scriptures Rev 22:21 .
[166]  This indicates that in the accomplishment of His eternal economy, God commences it in His incarnation by coming to be a man as the grace to the believers.
[167]  Hence, grace is the Triune God in His incarnation to be dispensed to the believers by the Father as the source, by the Son as the element, and by the Spirit as the application 2 Cor 13:14 .
[168]  The varied grace of God that indicates the riches of the grace of God in its varieties ministered by the saints one to another 4:10.
[169]  Romans 1:5 reveals that the grace of God is for the enablement of the apostles.
[170]  No one in himself is able to be an apostle, but the grace of God enables certain believers to be apostles.
[171]  Romans 5:21 speaks of the grace that may reign through righteousness unto eternal life.
[172]  Verse 17 says that we reign by the grace in life, while verse 21 says that grace reigns unto eternal life.
[173]  That means grace reigns over us and over everything so that we can enjoy the eternal life.
[174]  2 OUTLINE In his writings, Paul unveils to us that the grace of God is: The grace that was given to the Corinthian believers based upon which the apostle thanked God 1 Cor 1:4.
[175]  The grace that God gave to Paul which made him a wise master builder 3:10.
[176]  The grace that made Paul an apostle who labored more abundantly than all the other apostles; such a grace is just God Himself working through the apostle 15:10.
[177]  The grace which is the Lord Jesus Christ Himself and which is always with all the believers 16:23.
[178]  First Corinthians 1:4 speaks of the grace that was given to the Corinthian believers based upon which the apostle thanked God.
[179]  In 2 Corinthians 1:12 Paul said, For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
[180]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ which was in the spirit of the Galatian believers for their remaining in God s New Testament economy 6:18.
[181]  The rich grace of God with which He graced the believers in choosing, predestinating, and redeeming them in Christ Eph 1:6-7.
[182]  One day a man sent by God sounded the trumpet to call the Galatians out of the law s bondage to the gospel according to God s economy.
[183]  The Galatian believers fell from grace because they went back to the law for their justification 5:4 .
[184]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the bountiful supply of the Triune God who is embodied in the Son and realized as the life-giving Spirit enjoyed by us through the exercise of our human spirit.
[185]  Ephesians 4:7 says, To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
[186]  Philippians 4:23 speaks of the grace which was with the spirit of the Philippian believers in their experiences of Christ when the church was under persecution.
[187]  When the church was under persecution, the Philippian believers kept on experiencing Christ by the Spirit within them, and that Spirit was the grace.
[188]  We have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ to experience Christ and to magnify Christ, regardless of how much persecution there is toward the church.
[189]  4 OUTLINE In his writings, Paul unveils to us that the grace of God is: The grace of the Lord which superabounded with faith and love in Christ to the apostle Paul for his dynamic and excellent salvation that he might be one of the greatest apostles 1 Tim 1:14.
[190]  The grace with Timothy that enabled him to guard the deposit and turn away from profane, vain babblings and antitheses of what was falsely called knowledge, not misaiming concerning the faith 6:20-21.
[191]  The grace according to which God had saved the apostles and called them with a holy calling and which was given to them in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages 2 Tim 1:9.
[192]  The grace which is in Christ Jesus and in which Timothy, one of the younger co-workers of the apostle Paul, was empowered in the degradation of the church 2:1.
[193]  The grace of God which has appeared to bring salvation to all men, training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age, awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ Titus 2:11-13.
[194]  The grace of which the Spirit is and with which the Spirit worked within the staggering Hebrew believers, who were insulting the Spirit by shrinking back to their Judaism from God s New Testament salvation, trampling underfoot the Son of God and considering the blood of the covenant by which they were sanctified a common thing 10:29.
[195]  If there were no grace of God, none of us could have faith and love in Christ.
[196]  It is a wonder that we can believe in Jesus and love Him whom we have never seen.
[197]  Second Timothy 4:22, the last verse of 2 Timothy, says, The Lord be with your spirit.
[198]  Hebrews 10:29 says, By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
[199]  5 OUTLINE Gleanings in the vast field of God s grace: The grace which was the initiation of God s grace in the New Testament by the Holy Spirit s visit to Mary for the conceiving of Christ Luke 1:28, 30.
[200]  The grace in which the Lord Jesus grew in His humanity as the preparation for Him to minister the grace of God in His ministry as the Savior of man 2:40.
[201]  The grace in which Jesus as a young boy advanced with God and men while He was also advancing in wisdom and stature 2:52.
[202]  The grace that proceeded out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus as the God-sent Prophet to men to meet their need 4:22.
[203]  The grace which is the expression of God s attributes in human virtues in the living of the early believers in Jerusalem Acts 2:47.
[204]  V. GLEANINGS IN THE VAST FIELD OF GOD S GRACE 1.
[205]  Grace in the New Testament by the Holy Spirit s
[206]  Acts 2:47 describes a situation in which the early believers in Jerusalem were contacting God and experiencing God.
[207]  6 OUTLINE Gleanings in the vast field of God s grace: The grace that was to come unto the believers, which was prophesied by the prophets, who sought and searched diligently concerning the salvation of the believers souls 1 Pet 1:10.
[208]  The grace on which the believers set their hope perfectly and which will be brought to the believers at the revelation of Jesus Christ 1:13.
[209]  The grace with God which is the believers bearing sorrows by suffering unrighteously and the believers enduring while doing good and suffering 2:19-20.
[210]  The grace which God gives to the humble while He resists the proud 5:5.
[211]  The grace in which, together with the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the believers should grow unto His glory both now and unto the day of eternity 2 Pet 3:18.
[212]  This is the concluding word of the apostle Peter s writings, indicating that whatever he has written is of, in, by, and through the grace of God.
[213]  The grace which we the believers have received in the New Testament is rich unto its fullness, which is the expression of the overflowing riches which we have received in Christ through the Spirit for the accomplishment of God the Father s New Testament economy, which is His eternal economy John 1:16.
[214]  The grace of the Lord Jesus dispensed to His believers throughout the New Testament age consummates in the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God s good pleasure in joining and mingling Himself with man for His glorious enlargement and eternal expression Rev 22:21.
[215]  The grace mentioned by Peter here is different from the grace mentioned in John 1.
[216]  John said that the Word became flesh, full of grace, and that grace came through Jesus Christ vv.
[217]  According to 1 Peter 2:19-20, if you suffer unrighteous persecution as a believer or if you endure suffering while you are doing good, what you do is grace with God.
[218]  Note 1 of 1 Peter 2:19 says, Grace here refers to the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our living, which becomes in our behavior gracious and acceptable in the eyes of both man and God v. 20 . When we suffer persecution while we are doing good, this is grace with God, because this is something motivated by the divine life within us and expressed in our living.
[219]  Revelation 1:4 speaks of the grace which is given to the local churches in the dark age of the church s degradation for the believers who seek to answer the Lord s calling to be His overcomers over the self Matt 16:24 , the devil Heb 2:14 , sin Rom 5:21a , the cosmos of Satan John 12:31 , satanic Judaism Rev 3:9 , demonic Catholicism Rev 2:20, 24 , and Christless Protestantism Rev 3:1b, 20 for the closing of all the ages and for the bringing in of the New Jerusalem.
[220]  We need to realize that Christ changed in His form twice.
[221]  John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word,...and the Word was God.
[222]  Christ was God, and then He became flesh to be the last Adam, and this last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
[223]  The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself, and Christ Himself is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us to impart the Triune God into our being.
[224]  In the second step the last Adam, as the embodiment of the Triune God, became the life-giving Spirit through His death and resurrection as grace entering into man for the impartation of the processed and consummated Triune God into the believers, to be the source, element, and essence of the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the glorious enlargement and expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in eternity.
[225]  in the Epistle to the Romans Message Twenty-Five The Announcing of the Gospel
[226]  1 OUTLINE The apostle Paul s perfect example and high standard in announcing the gospel: Chosen to be a vessel not a carrier but a vessel to contain Christ Acts 9:15.
[227]  Appointed to be a minister and a witness of Christ Acts 26:16.
[228]  Separated unto the gospel of God Rom 1:1; Gal 1:15-16.
[229]  The New Testament revelation concerning the announcing of the gospel gives us a very high standard and a perfect example in the apostle Paul.
[230]  First, this announcer was chosen by God to be a vessel not a carrier but a vessel to contain Christ Acts 9:15 .
[231]  God is the highest authority in the universe; God sent Paul as His ambassador to the sinners to speak in boldness the mystery of the gospel Eph 6:19-20 .
[232]  An ambassador always represents a higher authority to contact and deal with others.
[233]  If someone rejects you when you are announcing the gospel, you may say, Sir, I am an ambassador of God sent by Him to you .
[234]  The church is the Body of Christ, and the Body of Christ is the house of God, the kingdom of God, and Christ s bride.
[235]  Paul told the Corinthians that he begot them through the gospel 1 Cor 4:15 .
[236]  This is not to win souls but to beget children.
[237]  J. For the Building Up of the Body of Christ
[238]  We go to beget people, to regenerate people, not that they may go to heaven but that they may be the material to build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12 .
[239]  2 OUTLINE The commission of the Lord as the Christ of God: After all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord as the King-Savior commissioned His disciples to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and teaching them to observe all that He had commanded them, to make them citizens of His kingdom of the heavens Matt 28:18-20.
[240]  In His resurrection the Lord as the Slave-Savior charged His disciples to go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation of which mankind is the main item to redeem and save God s lost creation from the vanity and slavery of corruption back to Him to enjoy the freedom of His glory Mark 16:14-15; Rom 8:20-21 in His new creation Gal 6:15b .
[241]  After the accomplishment of God s redemption for man through His death and resurrection, the Lord as the Man-Savior charged His disciples to proclaim repentance for forgiveness of sins in His name to all the nations that the fallen men may be redeemed back to the way of peace that leads them into the blessing prepared by God for them according to His eternal economy Luke 24:46-48; 1:77-79; 2:30-32.
[242]  After He had trained the disciples to know the kingdom of God, which, according to God s New Testament economy, is different from the kingdom of Israel, and when He was ready to return to the heavens triumphantly in the presence of His disciples Acts 1:2-9 , the Lord as the Victor over Satan, sin, and death, the One who was to be made by God in the heavens both the Lord and Christ, charged His disciples to be His witnesses, especially of His resurrection and His ascension 2:32-36; 5:30-32 , from Jerusalem unto the uttermost part of the earth, by the power of the Spirit 1:8 , that is, to announce the gospel of the kingdom of God 8:12 for the establishment of the kingdom of God on the earth 1:3; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31; Rom 14:17; Eph 2:19; 5:5 .
[243]  Peter s reminding of the believers concerning the telling out of the virtues of God 1 Pet 2:9: Corporately by a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a people acquired for a possession of God.
[244]  To proclaim abroad as the gospel the virtues mercy, compassion, lovingkindness, love, grace, redemption, forgiveness, justification, regeneration, salvation, etc. of God, who has called the believers out of darkness into His marvelous light for the testimony that the believers as God s chosen race who are under God s bright governmental dealing in His house 1 Pet 4:17 do not live and walk in darkness but in the marvelous light of God 2:11-12 .
[245]  To come and take the water of life freely for their enjoyment of the riches of the Triune God flowing out of the throne of God and of the Lamb as a river of water of life to be the rich supply with Christ as the tree of life to the New Jerusalem as the Triune God s glorious enlargement and expression for eternity Rev 21:1 22:5.
[246]  Jesus is our Lord and He is the Christ of God, so He has the standing to commission us for His gospel.
[247]  All the authority in heaven and on earth, in the whole universe, has been given to God s Christ.
[248]  After the unveiling of the mysterious mingling of the Divine Trinity with the believers John 14:8-11, 16-20 , the Lord as the God-Savior charged His disciples to bear fruit for His increase that His mystical Body, which is signified by the true vine composed of Him and His believers as His branches, may be completed as His fullness, His expression, as the New Jerusalem in eternity John 15:16a; 3:30; 15:1-8; Rev 21:1 22:5 .
[249]  In John 14 Christ unveiled the mysterious mingling of the Triune God with the believers.
[250]  In this portion of the Word, the Lord Jesus told us that He came in the flesh to be with us, among us, but He was unable to get into us.
[251]  First Peter 2:9 says, But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
[252]  To tell out is to preach, to proclaim, and the virtues of God are the contents of the gospel.
