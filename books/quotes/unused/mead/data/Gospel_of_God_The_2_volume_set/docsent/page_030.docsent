   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S GRACE NOT RELATED TO MAN'S ACHIEVEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now the second issue arises.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not everything that man does is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's eyes, all of man's acts are sins, but in man's eyes, many things he does are achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some consider that since they are such extreme sinners, they cannot receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Others think that because they sin, they have to improve themselves before they can receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please notice that there is a difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first group says that they have sinned and are therefore unqualified to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This group is absolutely in the negative realm.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second group is a little more positive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They say that they are sinners and will only receive grace if they act better.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They think that they have to attain a certain standard of conduct and certain achievements before they can receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the mind of the first group, the problem is hindrance from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the mind of the second group, the problem is how to obtain grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some think that wrongdoings will hinder us from receiving God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others think that achievements will enable us to obtain God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Friend, do you know what grace is?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Grace is unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is free, and it is not given based on any reason.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is God's work of love which He bestows on us, the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God's grace were related to man's achievements, the nature of grace would immediately be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as a trace of achievement is allowed to remain in us, God must reward us according to our achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And since He is righteous, He is just.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has to reward and recompense man according to his achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if God's giving is a recompense or reward, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As soon as achievements come in, recompense must also come in and grace is out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a man gives you a month's labor and you give him a month's wages, the payment cannot be considered a gift; it is a recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has done something for you; it is his achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If it is an achievement, the payment is not grace, but recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once recompense comes in, grace goes out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 4:4 makes the matter very clear: "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Wrongdoings do not stop us from receiving grace; on the contrary, they afford us the opportunity to receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Achievements do not help us to receive God's grace; on the contrary, they annul the nature of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unless it is free, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unless it is given without reason and cause and unless it is a gift, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there is some reason or some cause involved, if there is a price involved, or if there is some work involved, the matter of recompense immediately comes in because God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once recompense comes in, the nature of grace is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are standing on a position that is above God, or even one that is equal with God, you cannot receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That is why Romans 4 says clearly that no one can come before God and say that he has done this or that and, therefore, unashamedly ask for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a person says that he is not like others who have extorted money or who are so unrighteous, that he fasts at least twice a week, that even though he may not have tithed, he at least offered up one-twentieth of what he has, he cannot receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me say this in an emphatic way grace is receiving without having a reason to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once there is a reason, it becomes recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you have any achievements, the matter of recompense comes in and grace is out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must pay much attention to this matter.</S>
