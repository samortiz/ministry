[1]  Crucial Principles for the Christian Life and the Church Life CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE VINE AND THE WORD Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14; 15:1, 4-5, 7, 26; 6:63; 14:17-20 THE VINE AND THE HUSBANDMAN Five Major Items That Have
[3]  Although as individual human beings we seem small and insignificant, we are actually quite meaningful.
[4]  Christ is the true vine, and God the Father as the husbandman cultivates this vine.
[5]  The picture of the vine and the husbandman shows us what God is doing in this universe and what we need to do.
[6]  As branches in the vine, we simply need to grow Christ by expressing Him.
[7]  We need only to look at the picture of the vine to see that we are branches in Christ and that we should simply live Christ.
[8]  Many believers do not touch and receive the word regularly.
[9]  We need to daily read and pray-read the Bible.
[10]  OF THE WORD Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:16; 1 Cor 1:18; Phil 2:16; Eph 5:26; Col 3:16 THE FUNCTIONS OF THE WORD The Bible Being God s Breath
[11]  We need to realize that the Bible we hold is simply God s breath and that where God s breath is, there His presence is.
[12]  Recently, some have criticized my ministry, saying, Brother Lee has given many legalities to us.
[13]  He says that we need to legally come to the Word every morning and legally pray and contact the Lord every day.
[14]  If we are sloppy and careless, depending on inspiration to wash, eat, or breathe, we may claim that we are liberated, free, and not under any bondage, but we will actually be killing ourselves.
[15]  My burden in this chapter is that we would see what the constituents of the Word are.
[16]  We may know that the contents of the Bible are the sixty-six books from Genesis to Revelation, but we need to see the very constituents of the Word of God.
[17]  The Bible is constituted with three major items: Christ, who is the living Lord as our life, His death, and His resurrection.
[18]  Many saints have read in spiritual books that we have been crucified and resurrected with Christ.
[19]  The biggest frustration to understanding the Bible is trying to understand it.
[20]  We may think that when we read the Bible, the purpose is to understand it.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE THE ANOINTING AND THE CONSCIENCE Scripture Reading: Exodus 30:23-25; 1 John 2:27; 1:7; 3:20-21; Heb 9:14; 10:22; 1 Tim 1:19; Acts 24:16 ABIDING IN THE LORD
[22]  John 15:1-8 concerns Christ as the vine and the believers as branches in the vine.
[23]  The way to abide in the Lord is by the teaching of the anointing 1 John 2:27 .
[24]  This compound Spirit includes the divinity of the Triune God, the humanity of Christ, Christ s death, the effectiveness of His death, Christ s resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.
[25]  Many saints have learned the teaching that we have been crucified and resurrected and that we now need to reckon ourselves crucified and resurrected.
[26]  Because Christ s death and the effectiveness of His death are in the word and in the Spirit, when we receive the word and touch the Spirit, we enjoy and participate in Christ s death and its effectiveness.
[27]  Being crucified with Christ is not a matter of knowledge or reckoning; it is a matter of taking in the word and touching the Spirit because within the word and within the Spirit are the death of Christ and the effectiveness of His death.
[28]  BY DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE Our Conscience, the Entrance of Our Spirit, Needing to Be Opened and Cleansed
[29]  Hebrews 9:14 says, How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
[30]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:12, 15-19, 27; 2:2b, 6-7, 9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11; 1 Cor 12:12-13; Phil 1:21a; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:4 THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST
[31]  In the preceding chapters we have seen that God s economy is Christ as the vine and that the way to abide in this vine is to take in the word and touch the Spirit.
[32]  Many saints may know that the church is the house of God, the Body of Christ, the manifestation of God in the flesh, the dwelling place of God, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, the mystery of Christ, the one new man, the increase of Christ, and Christ s bride and wife 1 Tim 3:15-16; Eph 1:22-23; 2:15, 20-22; 3:6; 5:25-32; Col 3:10-11; John 3:29-30; Rev 19:7 .
[33]  Although this verse concerns the Body of Christ, the concluding words are not the Body but the Christ, proving that the church is Christ.
[34]  To live Christ is not to be deified to become a member of the Godhead; rather, to live Christ is to be a member of Christ that has the life and nature of Christ, just as all the parts of our body have the life and the nature of our person.
[35]  Because we have the same life and nature as Christ, we are parts of Christ, and we may even say that we are Christ.
[36]  Colossians first reveals that Christ is the portion of the saints 1:12 .
[37]  As believers in Christ, we gain Christ as our portion.
[38]  Christ is also the reality of every positive thing, such as food, water, air, and sunshine.
[39]  Verses 16 through 17 say, Let no one therefore judge you in eating and in drinking or in respect of a feast or of a new moon or of the Sabbath, which are a shadow of the things to come, but the body is of Christ.
[40]  A holiday, a feast, is a happy day, but if we do not have Christ, we cannot be joyful.
[41]  This Christ is our portion; we can enjoy Christ as the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation, the One in whom, through whom, and unto whom all things were created, the One who is before all things, the One in whom all things cohere, the Head of the Body, the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, the One who has the preeminence in all things, the One in whom all the fullness was pleased to dwell, the mystery of God, the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, the reality of every positive thing, and the One who is all and in all in the church.
[42]  The vision of the church being Christ repels all kinds of concepts.
[43]  If we all take Christ as everything, there will be no concepts.
[44]  If we lack a clear vision of the church being Christ and of Christ being the unique constituent of the church, many concepts will gradually creep in. The Lord s recovery has been in the United States for about sixteen years.
[45]  It is crucial to see the way to enjoy our wonderful Christ.
[46]  First Corinthians 15:45b says that He became a life-giving Spirit, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, The Lord is the Spirit.
[47]  CHAPTER FIVE THE GENUINE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: John 17:21-23; 1 Cor 1:12-13; Eph 4:2-6, 13-16 THE GENUINE ONENESS BEING CHRIST
[48]  In this chapter we will consider the truth in the New Testament concerning the genuine oneness of the church.
[49]  Christians today often speak of oneness, but there are many kinds of oneness that are not genuine.
[50]  In the previous chapter we saw that the church is Christ.
[51]  In verse 22 the Lord continued, The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.
[52]  We may not fully understand what this glory is, but we can see that glory is surely something of God and that it is in this glory that we can all be one.
[53]  Nevertheless, we need to be impressed with these three main points: our being in the Triune God v. 21 , the glory, the expression, of the Triune God that makes us one v. 22 , and the Triune God being in us that we may be perfected into one v. 23 . We need to bring these three points to the Lord in prayer.
[54]  Thus, Christ as life is the content, the nature, of the church in the Lord s recovery, and the genuine oneness is the standing of the church in the Lord s recovery.
[55]  When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit immediately entered into us.
[56]  These items are that God in Christ became a man, that this man, Jesus, died on the cross for our sins in order to redeem us, that He resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens to be our Savior, our Lord, and our life, and that He is coming again to receive us to Himself in His kingdom.
[57]  Rather, we need to remember that the church is uniquely Christ, that the nature of the church is life, which is Christ, and that the standing of the church is the genuine oneness, which also is Christ.
[58]  Christianity today is made up of denominations, which are divisions, or sects.
[59]  AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22; 1 Cor 11:3a; Matt 23:8, 10; 1 Pet 5:3, 5; 1 Cor 12:28; Acts 2:14; Gal 2:9-12; Acts 15:13, 19; Heb 13:17
[60]  The previous two chapters concerned two basic truths the church being Christ and the genuine oneness of the church.
[61]  This chapter concerns a third basic truth in the New Testament that is somewhat deeper the headship of Christ and the constitution of the church.
[62]  Because Christ gained the human element in His incarnation and accomplished God s purpose and defeated God s enemy in His crucifixion, He is now fully qualified to be the Head of the universe in God s administration.
[63]  No book sold in Christian bookstores today contains the truth that Christ s headship was not fully established until His ascension, because He needed to become a man and be crucified in order to accomplish God s eternal purpose and to defeat and destroy God s enemy.
[64]  Through the twenty centuries of church history the matter of how the church should be organized has been a continual problem.
[65]  The church does not consist of only one or two persons.
[66]  State churches have the head of government as the head of the church and are therefore an insult to the headship of Christ.
[67]  The church is constituted absolutely not according to the human mentality or worldly organizational methods but with Christ as life and with Christ as the unique Head.
[68]  Not only are all the members equal, but also all the local churches are equal, regardless of their size.
[69]  The church that has the most members is not the head church.
[70]  In his first Epistle to Timothy the apostle Paul wrote, If I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God 3:15 .
[71]  Timothy needed some instruction to know how to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church.
[72]  The Lord s word in Matthew 23:8-12 indicates that we should not have any leader.
[73]  Today in the New Testament age there is only one unique Leader, that is, Christ.
[74]  First Corinthians 12:28 says, God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.
[75]  First Timothy 3:15 says that the church is the pillar and base of the truth.
[76]  The pillar and base of the truth is the entire church, including all the saints, not only the elders and leading ones.
[77]  The New Testament reveals that the church in ancient times met in a solid way, in a way to edify and instruct the saints.
[78]  In summary, in order to know how to conduct ourselves in the church life as the house of God, we need to be careful to always do two things: never insult the headship of Christ and always learn, guard, and bear the truth.
[79]  Question: I have heard some say that we should all stay in one boat whether we are right or wrong, that if we go over a cliff, at least we will be one, that we should not disturb the oneness even if we sense an objection within, and that we should simply go along and trust that the Lord will bless the oneness and bring us through somehow.
[80]  All the truths in the Bible refer to God Himself directly or indirectly by referring to items such as Christ, the Spirit, Christ s redemption, Christ s crucifixion, or Christ s resurrection.
[81]  IN THE HOUSE OF GOD 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-6; 3:15-16; 4:7-8; 6:3; 2 Tim 2:15; 4:3-4; 3:16-17
[82]  In this chapter we will continue to consider the matter of how to conduct oneself in the house of God.
[83]  In 1 Timothy 3:16 Paul said, Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit, / Seen by angels, / Preached among the nations, / Believed on in the world, / Taken up in glory.
[84]  In this verse the manifestation of God in the flesh refers not only to Christ Himself but also to the church.
[85]  Because taken up in glory is listed last in verse 16, it must refer not only to Christ s ascension but also to the church s rapture.
[86]  This is a strong indication that the manifestation of God in the flesh, the great mystery of godliness, includes both Christ and the church.
[87]  The manifestation of God in the flesh includes both Christ and the church because Christ is the Head and the church is His Body.
[88]  Theologians may argue that only Christ is the manifestation of God, but this is illogical, for a person s body has the same life and nature as the head.
[89]  Based on this definite principle, it is clear that just as Christ, the Head, is the manifestation of God, so also the church, the Body of Christ, is the manifestation of God.
[90]  In order to properly conduct ourselves in the house of God, the church, we also need to take care of the healthy teaching.
[91]  Second Timothy 4:3-4 says, The time will come when they will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths.
[92]  In the entire Bible there is not another verse like 2 Timothy 3:16.
[93]  Verses 15 through 17 say, From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
[94]  All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.
[95]  The apostle Paul wrote these words purposefully to indicate that when the church is in degradation, whoever desires to be a man of God, a godly man, must take care of the Scriptures.
[96]  Everyone in the Lord s recovery should be a Bible lover, always eating, reading, and studying the word of God in the Bible.
[97]  Question: What is the proper way to meet for saints who live in small cities near a larger city with an established church?
[98]  Answer: The principle we have practiced for many years has been that the saints living in the smaller cities initially meet with the church in the larger city.
