If we would fight the spiritual warfare for the kingdom of God, we need a proper humanity. God needs man to deal with His enemy, Satan, and this man is Jesus. Only one man is qualified to fight the battle, and this man is our person. Since He is our person within, His humanity is ours to fight the battle for the kingdom of God.<p>Furthermore, to serve the Lord in the church in a proper way, we need the humanity of Jesus. In his two letters to Timothy, Paul covered three kinds of serving ones. He first spoke of the elders, the overseers or bishops (different titles for the same person). These are the leading ones of the church. Then he referred to the deacons and deaconesses, the brothers and sisters who are the serving ones in the church. &#8220;Deacon&#8221; comes from a Greek word which means one that serves. Paul also addressed the Lord&#8217;s servants, such as Timothy. Hence, there are three kinds of serving ones in the church: the elders, the deacons and deaconesses, and the workers for the Lord. All these serving ones need the proper humanity. This is basic. Just as the acacia wood was the standing element for the boards of the tabernacle (Exo. 26:15), so the humanity of Jesus is the standing element in all the spiritual things. Whether we are in the spiritual warfare or in the church service, we need the proper humanity.<p>In this chapter we must see that the humanity of Jesus is also necessary for our daily walk. The humanity of Jesus is needed for fighting, for serving, and also for living. If we do not have the proper humanity, our daily walk cannot be proper.<h2 class=head1>THE EXPOSURE OF OUR HUMANITY</h2><p>Most of the older ones have already experienced the fact that the more we try to use our own humanity, the more we realize that it is absolutely disabled. Some of the younger ones may not yet believe that their humanity is so worthless. The older you are, however, the more you will recognize the depravity of your own humanity. Before we were sixteen years of age, we had a certain kind of confidence in our humanity. But once we were sixteen, we began to realize how hopeless we were. Then, after graduating from college, we realized that we were even more hopeless. And by the time we were married, we were fully convinced that our humanity was fallen beyond repair. Many young sisters, before they were married, thought that they were indeed wonderful, but marriage became a real exposure to them. After being married, although many would blame their husbands, they found out their true condition.<p>Now we are in the church, where there is no darkness. Everything is under the light, and everything is transparent. There is nothing that exposes us like the church. While we are in the church meetings, we are under the heavenly X-ray. Our humanity is exposed so that we may see the need of the proper humanity. Yet, when we are exposed by the heavenly light, we must immediately apply the blood. We need to pray, &#8220;O Lord, cleanse me from all of my past with Your blood. Cover me with Your blood.&#8221;<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ as the Reality &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
