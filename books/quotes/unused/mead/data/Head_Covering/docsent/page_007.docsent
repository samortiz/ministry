   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT GOING TO THE EXTREME</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, some may go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They may think that since the man is the head, the woman should subject herself to him in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This puts the woman in a position of blind submission in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of submission is unprofitable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The problem with some is that either they do not do anything at all or they go to an extreme when they do something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul told us that the matter is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He continued in 1 Corinthians 11:11 with the word however.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Head covering is an outward testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to do it for the sake of an outward testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what is the reality and the intrinsic significance of this testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 11 says, However neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may ask, What did Paul mean when he said neither is woman without man, nor man without woman?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul explained in verse 12: For just as the woman is out from the man, so also is the man through the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the garden of Eden, the woman came out of the man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But today, after the garden of Eden, man comes out of woman.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every man is born of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In reality neither is woman without man, nor man without woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Neither man nor woman can say that he or she is anything special.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But all things are out from God v. 12 . Head covering is merely a sign on the head of submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the end all things are out from God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In reality man is born of woman, and woman came out from man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one can be proud of himself, and no one can despise himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 13 says, Judge this in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here Paul seems to ask the sisters in particular, After hearing this word and realizing that in God s government God is the Head of Christ, Christ is the Head of every man, man is the head of the woman, and God has appointed the woman to be a representative of Christ before God, do you still think that it is fitting for a woman to pray with her head uncovered?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 14 says, Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here Paul appealed to the feeling of the church in judging the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Pay special attention to the words: Does not even nature itself teach you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 15 says, But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Women all over the world treasure and take pride in their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hair expresses the glory of a woman; a woman always likes to keep her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have never seen a woman throw her hair into the garbage bin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hair is a woman s glory; it is precious to her.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, God gave the woman her long hair for a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would like to point out two things to you: Since God gave women long hair for a covering, Paul indicated that the woman should add a head covering to this covering, because God wants her to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since a woman s long hair is a God-given covering, she should cover it further with a man-made covering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should read verses 6 and 15 together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 6 says, For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 15 says, But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The thought is quite clear once we put these two verses together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has covered the woman s head with her hair.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This being the case, those women who accept God s authority should use something to cover their hair.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a woman refuses to cover her hair, she should cut off the hair which God has given her.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, if you accept God s covering, you must also add your own covering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you do not accept His covering, you must give up what God has given you in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible does not forbid women from keeping long hair; it only says that long hair is not enough and that one should also add a head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today neither of the two commandments of the Bible is being observed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a sister does not cover her head but instead shaves off her hair, we can say that she is still obeying the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The trouble is that many women refuse to do either.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They neither shave their hair nor cover their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verse 6 says that if a woman does not have her hair covered she must be shaved, and that if she is not shaved she must cover her head.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 15 says that since God has covered us, we also should cover ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What should the obedient ones do?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This verse says that since God has covered us, we also should cover ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who know God will always add their part to what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They will always go along with God s way and not contradict it.</S>
