   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CHRIST IS THE BREAD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE LIGHT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 6:35; 8:12</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already briefly seen that all the spiritual things and all spiritual matters are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God gives us Christ to be our spiritual things and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the crucial point in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is our experience merely an experience?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or is our experience Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is our righteousness merely righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Or is our righteousness Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is our holiness merely holiness?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Or is our holiness Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is our redemption merely redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Or is our redemption Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We often speak of the way, but the way we speak of may not be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We often speak of the truth, but we do not realize that Christ Himself is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We often speak of the life, but the life we speak of may not be Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, we have many things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the biggest spiritual problem among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We say with our mouth that Christ is the centrality of all things, but in our living we still keep many things other than Christ, as if these things could help us live our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must turn this concept around.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must realize that God has no intention for us to keep so many so-called spiritual things other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Under God's sovereign arrangement, there are things and matters, but God's things and matters are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is our righteousness; He does not give us a righteousness apart from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is our holiness; He does not give us a power apart from Himself that enables us to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is our redemption; He does not give us a redemption apart from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the way; He does not open a way for us apart from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the truth; He does not present us a truth apart from Himself and then charge us to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the life; He does not give us something called life apart from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, the more we go on in God's way, the more we will discover that there is only one grace among all God's graces.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is only one gift among all God's gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The grace is Christ, and the gift is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank God that He is showing us that Christ includes everything day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Formerly, we thought of the Lord as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we can say that He is not only our Savior, but our salvation as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is amazing, yet it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we were first saved, we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we can say that the Lord Jesus is also our redemption and our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>More and more we discover that Christ is God's things and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we wrongly presume that what the Lord Jesus gives is different from the Lord Jesus Himself, and if we wrongly presume that grace and the One who gives grace are separate, these mistakes will cause us to suffer great spiritual damage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It will cut us off from the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we need to see more concerning Christ being our things and matters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 6:35 and 8:12, the Lord tells us that He is the bread of life and the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us first see how He is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>CHRIST IS THE BREAD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said this to those who looked for Him in Capernaum.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They expected the Lord to give them food, and the Lord told them, "I am the bread of life."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that He is not only the One who gives the bread of life, but He is the bread of life itself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Giver and the gift are one, not two.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thank God, Christ is not only the Giver, but also the gift of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is the significance of bread in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Bible bread means satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible uses hunger to express man's dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to solve man's dissatisfaction, man must have bread.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whether or not God's children have the strength to go on depends upon whether they are satisfied within.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today if we feel satisfied within, we have strength.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we feel empty like a tire void of air, no one can drag us along.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We cannot say that we do not have life, but we can be without strength.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Satisfaction gives us strength.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Satisfaction enables us to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such an inexplicable satisfaction makes us feel well.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let us see what the bread of God's children is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord Jesus gives life, and He also sustains life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many Christians think that the bread is just an hour's prayer or an hour of reading the Bible; they do not realize that the bread is the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not mean that prayer or reading the Bible is useless, but we should remember that the Lord Jesus said, "I am the bread of life."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This means that the bread of life is just Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many times God's children are not satisfied because they do not realize that Christ is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We often meet hungry people, those who are not satisfied with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They are not satisfied with this, and they are not satisfied with that.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every day they are surrounded by dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not urging people to be proud or self-satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Pride and self-satisfaction are one thing, but eating to the full and becoming satisfied is another.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some people have been dealt with by God; they live before God fearfully, and they are in weakness and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They are not proud, yet they have touched the Lord and eaten to the full.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They are satisfied before God, and this satisfaction is their power.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>How then can we be filled?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>How can we be satisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to know that all satisfaction is related to Christ and all satisfaction is in life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Christ is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whenever we touch life in a real way, we are immediately satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whenever we offend life, we immediately feel inwardly collapsed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We need to mention some concrete examples to see how man can be satisfied.</S>
