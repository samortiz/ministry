   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR By Ruth Lee Issue No. 7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are now sending out another issue of The Present Testimony; it has been three months since the publication of the sixth issue!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have kept many readers waiting for a long time, but we ourselves have been thinking about this every day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet due to special reasons, we would rather delay its publication than move rashly and fill up the pages carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>May God grant us grace that the eighth issue will not be delayed so much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the past few months, God the Father has granted mercy and great grace to His servant, our brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We thank Him for this!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, Brother Nee wishes to wait on God quietly for the next four or five months and seek further and clearer revelation from the Lord before launching himself on the way ahead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During this period, we wish to clarify two things: first, all mail from brothers and sisters to Brother Nee personally will regrettably not be answered by him for now, and second, he will try his best to answer all questions related to spiritual experience at a later date.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Nee apologizes for not answering any questions related to biblical interpretations, not because he is unwilling, but simply because he does not have the time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more our vision is enlarged to see the eternal will of God, the more joyful and hopeful we are, and the more we need to recognize clearly the boundaries which God has measured to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God has raised up some to do another kind of work, we ask the Lord to bless it and our hearts rejoice for it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we, in ourselves, dare not start a work in order to meet the pressing need in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What we pray for and hope for is that we may be faithful to the Lord within the limits which He has measured to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we consider that the church shares the same life as Christ and will ultimately grow up fully into Him, the Head, we simply cannot refrain from praising with singing this mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Oh brothers and sisters, may the Lord stir up our fervent and loving heart to rise and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Pray to hasten the completion of the building of the Body of Christ and the coming of His kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>March 27, 1929</S>
