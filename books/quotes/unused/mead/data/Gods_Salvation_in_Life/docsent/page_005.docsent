   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. God's Salvation, with the Life of Christ the Life of God as the Focus, Meeting the Need for Authority Power</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although man would want to be God's vessel, it is such a pity that in this universe there is an evil power, symbolized by the other tree in the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In our surrounding environment, whether in our school, our office, or our society, there is an evil power enticing us not to do good but to do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, although you have made up your mind to do good, it is not up to you when you are surrounded by the power of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not a matter of redemption but a matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this full salvation God has prepared for us fallen sinners, one of its elements is to redeem us, and the other element is to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's salvation is to save us from the evil power that is within us, around us, and above us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, God's salvation, with the life of Christ the divine life as the focus, is to meet the need for authority, for power Rom 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of the fall, man now has a sinful nature within him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have been saved for seventy years, and I have been studying the Bible also for seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these seventy years I have contacted all kinds of people and have discovered that in man's sinful nature there are four "monsters."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every one of us, whether young or old, noble or base, has these four monsters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first monster is covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you see someone who has a nice pen on his desk, you begin to think, "How good it would be if he gave me the pen."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is covetousness, out of which comes stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second monster is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Look at society today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Children who are still in elementary school begin to be attracted to the opposite sex, and old men with white hair still go to dancing parties; this is lust.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The third monster is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone seeks vainglory and craves high positions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a certain university in America, among the top students there was a student in second place who tried to kill the best student.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a wonder that someone would even try to commit murder in order to become number one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Pride and vainglory are in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In politics, the one who is a bureau director desires to be a department head.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After becoming a department head, he wants to be the vice president, and after becoming the vice president, he hopes to be the president.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After that I do not know what else he would want to be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Maybe he would like to go to heaven and make himself like God just as the devil desired.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many important persons in the government fight with one another because of their love for vainglory and their struggle for power and position.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is pride.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, there is the top monster, and the name of this monster is anger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not consider anger to be a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a person is angry, he easily becomes enraged and gets furious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in his fury he will quarrel and fight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I know these things because while preaching the gospel and teaching the truth, I mainly contact and serve people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, there was a very good couple both about thirty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One day the husband was offended in the office and was still full of anger after he left the office and got into his car.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wanted to find a place to vent his anger and thought that he could do it at home with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By coincidence, on that day the wife was also full of anger at home because the children had been unruly, a neighbor had come to quarrel with her, and a relative had scolded her over the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, when the husband got home, it was a situation of anger versus anger.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When these two came face to face, both became inflamed with anger.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When anger comes, who can overcome it?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the husband and wife are angry, they become enraged and get into a fury; then they quarrel and fight.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, they either are separated or get a divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, covetousness, lust, pride, and anger are the four monsters within us that cause us to not behave properly as human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every day we are under the manipulation of these four monsters: covetousness, lust, pride, and anger.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every one of us fallen sinners has become unseemly because of these four monsters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many things you do in secret that you dare not tell anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are some things you do in secret that you would not tell your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are other things that you would not reveal to your wife or that you would not let your husband know.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God created us in His image and according to His likeness, yet we are not like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have become unruly and have gone astray because of the sinful nature that is within us.</S>
