<p>In the Bible-reading meeting, it is best to read one chapter a week. It is not advisable to cover too much material. This can be compared to eating. If we swallow food without chewing, we cannot taste the food. One chapter a week may be considered rather slow. Since the saints come together only once a week, some churches encouraged the saints to read one chapter a day at home. In this way they can read six chapters in a week. This is very good. However, they should not cover all six chapters when they come together to fellowship. Instead, it is best to cover only one chapter. Hence, whether in giving a message or reading the Word together, we should never try to cover too much material. This is a great principle. It is very good to release one point in a meeting. Releasing two or more points may cause the meeting to lose its focus and be ruined. Therefore, it is not good to cover too much material.</p>
<p>If we read six chapters of the Bible per week, we will read more than three hundred chapters in fifty-two weeks, but we may not remember that much. However, if we read one chapter a week in the meeting with light and supply, we will read fifty-two chapters in a year. How rich that will be! This will give the saints a good impression and stir up their love for reading the Bible, causing them to read the Bible by themselves. They may even read six chapters a day. In this way they will build up the personal habit of reading the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Making the Word Tasty to People</h2>
<p>Immediately after I was saved, I loved the Bible and was perfected in reading the Bible. We should extract the life supply from the Bible to feed the brothers and sisters. In this way they will acquire a taste, desire the supply, and enjoy reading the Bible. They will even enjoy reading the Bible by themselves.</p>
<p>If six chapters are covered in the Bible-reading meeting every week, there will not be any enjoyment, and the saints will become disinterested and bored. Therefore, we should not read too many chapters, lest our haste makes waste, and we get exactly the opposite effect. It is best to read one chapter, and extract the riches from this portion to feed the saints. Then the saints will feel that the Bible is so sweet and rich and will want to continue coming to the meeting. They will even study the Bible at home. Hence, it is not advisable to read many chapters in the Bible-reading meeting. However, the saints should read one or more chapters a day by themselves.</p>
<p>Those who are responsible for ministering the word must study how to conduct the Bible-reading meeting. We must first have some solid and nutritious food for the brothers and sisters. Then we must make the meeting &ldquo;tasty&rdquo; for the brothers and sisters. Of course, we should not use gimmicks, but we should give the saints the feeling that they have gained something. In this way they will even invite others to come and listen to the Lord&rsquo;s Word. Thus, the Bible-reading meeting and the ministry of the word are closely related.</p>
<p>Recently a church began a meeting for the pursuit of <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</em> on the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening. The number participating in this meeting was greater than that in the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. There were between one hundred forty to one hundred fifty people in the meeting even though the meeting hall can only accommodate approximately one hundred thirty people. Some people sat in the courtyard. Another church in the south of Taiwan began a Bible-reading meeting in which the attendance went from sixty people to one hundred forty. The saints gained a solid supply. It is worthwhile for us to study together.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Supply of the Word<br />
Having a Focus and Being General</h2>
<p>When the brothers taking the lead in the Bible-reading meeting sense that something is the need of the church, they should consider how to impress this point on the brothers and sisters. They should not speak concerning this point lightly but should repeat it emphatically until the saints receive it. In northern China I spent about five years speaking concerning the cross. Every day I hammered this burden into the saints. I used every opportunity to speak of the cross. My way was to repeatedly and continually drive the matter of the cross into every brother and sister. This practice is good but we should not carry it out too rigidly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should be general in emphasizing a burden so that other needs can be met. A local church should focus on the ministry of the word, but it should also take care of other aspects. For example, when I emphasized the cross in northern China, my speaking also covered other needs. We should observe everything and take care of matters as they arise. We need to take care of the elders, the deacons, those who visit people, and those who are burdened to preach the gospel. If we do not take care of all the needs, our locality may be perfected in one need but be lacking in another need. For example, if a brother continually speaks on the flesh, neglecting other needs, the bread-breaking meeting may become dry because everyone will be concerned with the flesh. Likewise, the gospel preaching will stop because everyone is speaking about the flesh. Even the church services may dry up. Therefore, we should take care of the various needs.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
