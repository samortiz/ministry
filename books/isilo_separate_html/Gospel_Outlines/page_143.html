<h1 class="title">GRACE, REDEMPTION, AND JUSTIFICATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 3:24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Grace
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Grace is the expression and manifestation of God&rsquo;s love.</li>
	<li>Grace is something freely given of God or done by God.</li>
	<li>God freely saves and justifies us; He did something for us and gave us something freely.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Redemption
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Redemption is necessitated by God&rsquo;s righteousness. God&rsquo;s righteousness requires that He accomplish redemption for us.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s redemption is accomplished by the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.</li>
	<li>The death of Christ on the cross satisfies the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness so that God&rsquo;s grace can come to us freely.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Justification
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Justification is the grace of God to save us according to the righteousness of God. Therefore, justification is both grace bestowed upon us and God&rsquo;s righteousness accomplished for us.</li>
	<li>It is God&rsquo;s love that causes Him to have grace upon us, and God&rsquo;s righteousness which causes Him to accomplish redemption for us.</li>
	<li>Therefore, because of justification, God can reckon us righteous and is able to save us.</li>
	</ol></li>
