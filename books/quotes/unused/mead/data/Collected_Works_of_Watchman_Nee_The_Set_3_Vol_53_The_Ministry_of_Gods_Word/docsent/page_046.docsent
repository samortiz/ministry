   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The trouble with some people is that they turn the order of Christ and the Bible around.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They want to know the Bible first and then know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But it is possible for a man to know the Bible yet at the same time to not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew and Peter received mercy from God to have Christ first revealed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they read the Scripture afterwards, every sentence was clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are not Jews and may not realize the significance of this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose we were Jews and lived as Old Testament men in the land of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we studied the Old Testament according to the outward letter, the whole book would be a mystery to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today, the Old Testament is still a mystery to many unbelievers and so-called theologians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But Peter, Matthew, John, and James met Jesus of Nazareth, and God revealed His Son in them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more they read the Old Testament, the more it was opened to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When they came to a passage, they could say, "This is a fulfillment of what was written."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Throughout this book, from Genesis 1 to Malachi 4, they found that this Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, the very Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They did not know the Scripture through the Scripture itself, but through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who know Christ know the Bible spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many so-called Christians, nominal Christians, have read the Bible for years but know nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, once they see that Jesus is the Savior, they have a different feeling altogether when they read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a new book to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, when one knows the Lord, he knows the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revelation comes from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once a person has a revelation of Christ, he has a revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who think that they know the Lord just from the book do not necessarily have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The experiences of many who know the Lord tell us that it is useless to study the Bible by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must remember that a man must first know Christ before he can know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the case with the twelve disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was the same with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was a Pharisee, that is, one who knew the Scripture very well.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Pharisees were very familiar with the Scripture, yet they did not know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Paul was a good and pious Pharisee, and although he knew the Scripture very well, he persecuted those who were of the Way Acts 9:2; 22:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is possible for a man to know and be familiar with the Bible and yet still persecute the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul was such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Paul did not study the Scripture and then suddenly realize one day through his study that Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, God shone on him one day, which brought him the realization that this One was the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here was a man who hated and persecuted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He sought out believers, both male and female, in order to bring them bound to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was a stern persecutor of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What a wicked person he was!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet as soon as God flashed His light on him, he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Immediately he answered, "Who are You, Lord?" and went on to inquire of the Lord what he should do Acts 9:1-6; 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The prostration was genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fall was real.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul's body fell, his self fell, and his whole being fell.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul was humbled in his outward man, and he was humbled in his inward man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After he received this revelation, what do we learn of Paul in the rest of the book of Acts and in the Epistles?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was able to interpret the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was able to tell us that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Old Testament became an open book, a living book, to him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You can read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if you set aside the knowledge of Christ, your Bible becomes a closed book to you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why many educated and intelligent people find the Bible confusing and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You can tell them about all the merits of this book, but they will only shake their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To you this book is very clear, but to them it is very confusing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They do not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a man knows Christ, he will know God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not mean that no one can find God by reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some do find God from reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But this is a case of God's mercy; He chooses to enlighten such a person this way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While he is reading the Bible, God takes pleasure in revealing His Son to him and saving him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The way to know the Bible is by knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul was led by God to the point where he could explain to others in his many Epistles who this Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we read Romans, Galatians, and Ephesians, we find a man who was crystal clear about the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Where did Paul's knowledge come from?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He first knew Christ, and through that knowledge, he knew the Scripture.</S>
