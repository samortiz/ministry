<h2 class="head1">THE LAW BEING A TYPE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Based upon the fact that the law is the testimony of God, a picture of God, we may say that the law is also a type of Christ. How can the law be a type of Christ? The law is a type of Christ because Christ is God&rsquo;s portrait, God&rsquo;s picture, God&rsquo;s image (Col. 1:15).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAW BEING LINKED TO GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Now we need to see how the law is linked to God&rsquo;s economy. In studying the books of history in the Old Testament, we need to learn how to link these books to God&rsquo;s economy. In His economy God chose Israel, established them as a people, formed them as a nation, and gave them the law. How can we link this with God&rsquo;s economy? God&rsquo;s economy is God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature (but not in the Godhead) to produce the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Christ is the center, the reality, and the goal of God&rsquo;s economy. The law seems to have nothing to do with such an economy. How, then, can the law be linked to God&rsquo;s economy? The law is linked to God&rsquo;s economy because the law was given as God&rsquo;s portrait, God&rsquo;s picture, God&rsquo;s image, and God&rsquo;s testimony. As God&rsquo;s testimony the law is a type of Christ, who, being the image of God, is God&rsquo;s portrait, God&rsquo;s picture, God&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO KEEP THE LAW BEING TO EXPRESS GOD</h2>
<p>God charged Israel to keep the law. In typology, to keep the law means to express God. Keeping the law by not killing, not committing adultery, not stealing, not lying, and not coveting is the living of a God-man. Those who have the living of a God-man bear the image of God. They are a portrait of God and even a duplication of God.</p>
<p>The situation of today&rsquo;s world is utterly different from this. In the world we see not the life of a God-man but murder, adultery, fornication, stealing, lying, and coveting. Who tells the truth today? It is common for people to lie in a court of law in order to get money and then to boast about their lying. Many compete with others in business or at school because of their coveting. All the competitive ones are covetous. Some will even kill to get what they covet. Therefore, instead of being full of God-men, the earth is full of &ldquo;scorpions.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING THE LIFE OF A GOD-MAN<br />
IN OUR MARRIED LIFE AND IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the situation in the recovery. We all are believers. We believe in the Lord Jesus. We have repented and come back to the Lord, and we have been saved, even dynamically saved. Yet in our daily life we may not have the living of a God-man.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that for the children of Israel to keep the law was to live God and express God. However, they did not keep the law, and therefore they did not live God and express God. The situation is the same with us today. For the most part, we do not express God in our daily living.</p>
<p>We need to have a God-man living in our married life. If a married brother would live the life of a God-man in his married life, he would surely be a good husband, for he would be a real God-man in loving his wife. Likewise, if a married sister would live the life of a God-man in her married life, she would be a good wife, submitting herself to her husband.</p>
<p>We also need to have a God-man living in the church life, especially in relation to what we call the vital groups. How can we have a vital group if we ourselves are not vital? This is impossible. Suppose at dinner a brother and his wife are not happy with each other. They even exchange words and argue for quite a long time. Suddenly they remember that later that evening they must attend a meeting of their vital group. But how could this couple be vital in the meeting? Because they are not vital at home in their married life, they have no way to be vital in the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEED FOR A REAL REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Because we are short of the God-man living, we need a real revival. The children of Israel had only an outward law, but today we have something much stronger and much higher than the law. We have the all-inclusive, life-giving, compounded, consummated Spirit in us, who is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). We need to live Christ by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (vv. 20-21a).</p>
<p>We have such a Spirit within us, but what do we live and how do we live? Do we live Christ? In the church meetings we may live Christ, but do we live Christ at home with our husband or wife and with our children? We need a real revival to be God-men who live a life of always denying ourselves and being crucified to live Christ for the expression of God.</p>
