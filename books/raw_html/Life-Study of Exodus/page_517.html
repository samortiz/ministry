<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF LIFE<br />WITH THE RICHES OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>Romans 8:2 says, &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; Actually, it goes without saying that the Spirit of life contains the element of the divine life. With the Spirit of life we have the riches of the divine life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br />WITH THE IMPARTATION OF THE DIVINE LIFE</h2><p>First Corinthians 15:45 says that Christ, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit. Then 2 Corinthians 3:6 says that although the letter kills, the Spirit gives life. According to these verses, the Spirit is also the life-giving Spirit. This is the Spirit with the impartation of the divine life.</p><p>The life-giving Spirit has the ability to give us life. Now we have life within us. However, we do not have the ability to impart this life to others. But the Spirit of life is also the life-giving Spirit. This title indicates that He has the ability to impart life. Therefore, in this title of the Spirit the element of the impartation of life is implied.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD SPIRIT<br />WITH THE ELEMENTS OF ASCENSION<br />AND LORDSHIP</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &ldquo;And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; In this verse Paul does not speak of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, or the Spirit of life. Rather, he refers to the Lord Spirit. In this aspect of the Spirit the element of lordship is included. The Lord Jesus became the Lord after His ascension to the heavens. This means that a man from Nazareth named Jesus has been made the Lord of all. This lordship is now in the Spirit. In the Lord Spirit we have the elements of ascension and lordship.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF GRACE<br />WITH THE ELEMENT OF THE ENJOYMENT<br />OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p>The compound Spirit is also the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29). The Spirit of grace has the element of the enjoyment of the Triune God. This element is grace.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN SPIRITS<br />WITH THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFICATION</h2><p>Revelation 1:4 says, &ldquo;John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne.&rdquo; The Spirit has not only the element of life-impartation, but also that of intensification. The seven Spirits in the book of Revelation imply the Spirit with the element of sevenfold intensification.</p>
