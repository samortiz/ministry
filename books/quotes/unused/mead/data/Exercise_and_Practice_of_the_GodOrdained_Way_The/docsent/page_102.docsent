   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO MEET BY DENYING OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our disposition and character hinder us from practicing the proper Christian meeting; therefore, we must learn to deny our disposition and character.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the teaching of the New Testament, we must deny ourselves Matt 16:24 , our soul-life 16:26; Luke 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To deny ourselves is to deny our disposition, since the self is in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The soul-life is the person, and the being of the person is the disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The expression of the person, the self, is the character.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We sometimes say that someone is "a real character."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that a certain person expresses himself in a particular way which distinguishes him from everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As Christians we should be people who are always against our disposition and against our character.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be against our disposition and our character is to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must learn to always live, behave, and have our being against our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be against our disposition is to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without being against our disposition, we cannot have proper group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are not against our disposition and character, we will go to the meetings religiously, enter the meetings religiously, sit down religiously, and conduct ourselves in the meetings religiously.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The entire activity of the meetings will altogether be a matter of religion, because religion always matches our disposition and character.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we meet according to religion, disposition, and character, there will be no Spirit, no Christ, no life, and no speaking of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the situation of Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although many dear saints love the Lord very much, they do not meet with the Spirit or with Christ, but with religion and their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must learn to be against our disposition and character.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether or not we use our time in a proper way exposes our disposition and character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As full-timers it is very easy not to budget our time wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we were employed in a business, there was always a certain schedule which served to budget our time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As employees, you could not go in to work whenever you felt like it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you did this for even a short time, you might receive a termination slip and you would be fired.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As full-timers, it may seem that you do not have a boss since you have dropped your job.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may say that the Lord is your boss, but actually, you are your boss.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, you may go to work on time, but tomorrow, if you feel somewhat tired, you may go to work a little later.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who is your boss?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus Christ or yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, you are the boss.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I know that it is easy to spoil you as full-time trainees, because I have been in this line for many years, and I have seen many full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may say that we live, walk, and have our being in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But actually we often live, walk, and have our being completely according to our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One time I asked one of the sisters whether or not she functioned in the meetings she attended.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She responded by saying, "Oh, Brother Lee, you know that by birth I am not a person who can speak anything in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I was born quiet, and I am not an outspoken person."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I received such a response, I said, "This is just your disposition."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To use the word disposition is pleasant, but to use the word self is not so pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, the disposition and the self are very close.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To say that we are a certain way by birth seems to be a good excuse, but the Bible tells us that whenever we come together, we should have something, such as a psalm or song for speaking as well as for singing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord is not happy for us to sit in a meeting according to the way we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes the older sisters have said to me, "Brother Lee, we are over seventy years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the young ones to shout is okay, but we older ones find it difficult to do the same thing."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Their disposition became their argument against functioning as well as a vindication of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must be against our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A good practice to help overcome our silent disposition in the meetings is to praise the Lord by ourselves many times throughout the day but not in a way that would disturb or threaten others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we live a life of praising the Lord, when we come to the meetings, we will be beside ourselves with the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This enjoyment of Christ will encourage us to praise the Lord and shout, "Amen," when we come together with the saints in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are familiar with the traditional way of meeting in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The attendants come in and sit down quietly, waiting for the pastor to lead the singing, to give a message himself, or to introduce a guest speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only one speaks, and the others simply listen.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This kind of meeting annuls the function of the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But another way to meet is by each one coming into the meeting praising the Lord, singing, or saying, "Amen" as they enter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This meeting begins on the way to the meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It bears the testimony of Christ and makes the Lord very happy.</S>
