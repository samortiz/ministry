Actually, He was the Christ already before His ascension (Matt. 16:16). He was even called Christ from His birth (Matt. 1:16). That was for Him to accomplish the first part of God's economy for the accomplishment of God's redemption and the release of the divine life by His earthly ministry. In His ascension He was officially inaugurated into the position of God's Christ, God's appointed One, to carry out the second part of God's economy for the producing and the building up of the church by His heavenly ministry. The title Lord refers to His lordship in possessing all the universe. The title Christ refers to His being made the One who carries out God's eternal purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be Made Head over All Things to the Church<br>That All Things May Be Headed Up in Him</H2><P>Christ's ascension made Him Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). In ascension Christ was made the Head over all things to the church and for the church. This means that whatever He is as the Head over all things is transmitted to the church for the church's participation in His attainment that all things may be headed up in Him (Eph. 1:10). He is the Head over all things, and He is also the focus, the center, of all things. All things will be headed up in Him through the church.</P><P>Satan's fall and the fall of man made the universe a place of confusion and disorder. But Christ's ascension made Him the Head over all things to the church to bring everything in the universe back into good order. Therefore, all things will one day be headed up in Christ. This will be in the new heavens and the new earth through the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate consummation of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Baptize His Body in the Spirit</H2><P>In His ascension Christ baptized all His believers into one Body in the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:33; 1 Cor. 12:13). In His death He redeemed all His believers, in His resurrection He caused all His believers to be regenerated, and in His ascension He baptized all His believers into one Body in the Holy Spirit. By these three steps of death, resurrection, and ascension, to redeem the believers, to cause them to be regenerated, and to baptize them, He produced a Body. He completed this producing of His Body by His ascension. This was a great work accomplished by Christ in His ascension.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Be the Heavenly Minister</H2><P>In His ascension, Christ also became the heavenly Minister (Heb. 8:1). As the Minister of the true (heavenly) tabernacle, He has obtained in His ascension a more excellent ministry (Heb. 8:6) to minister heaven, which is not only a place but a condition of life, into us that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth, as He did while He was here, to fulfill our heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Secret of Experiencing Christ &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
