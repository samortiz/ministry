<h2 class="head1">THE PRIEST AND THE OFFERINGS</h2><p>The Gospel of Luke may be divided into seven sections: the introduction (1:1-4), the preparation of the Man-Savior in His humanity with His divinity (1:5&mdash;4:13), the ministry of the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes (4:14&mdash;19:27), the Man-Savior&rsquo;s presentation of Himself to death for redemption (19:28&mdash;22:46), the death of the Man-Savior (22:47&mdash;23:56), the resurrection of the Man-Savior (24:1-49), and the ascension of the Man-Savior (24:50-53). In this message we shall begin to consider the fourth section of this book&mdash;the Man-Savior&rsquo;s presentation of Himself to death for redemption.</p><p>The Lord Jesus made the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem for the purpose of being put to death. He knew that in Jerusalem He would present Himself to God on the altar. In the book of Leviticus the offerings offered on the altar are types of Christ, and in the New Testament fulfillment the altar is the cross.</p><p>The Bible reveals that Christ is not only the offerings, but also the offering Priest to offer the sacrifice to God. This means that He is both the Priest and the offerings. As the offering Priest, He presented Himself to the altar, to the cross. The thought that Christ is both the offering and the Priest is revealed clearly in the Epistle of Hebrews. In Hebrews we see that Christ is the High Priest who offered Himself to God as the eternal sacrifice (Heb. 9:11, 14). Now in the Gospel of Luke we see that Christ went down from Galilee, the place where He was working, to Jerusalem, the place where He would be put to death. In Jerusalem He would be both the offering and the Priest presenting this offering to God on the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">ENTERING INTO JERUSALEM TRIUMPHANTLY</h2><p>The Lord Jesus was not arrested by the Pharisees in Galilee and then brought by them to Jerusalem to be put to death. On the contrary, He went to Jerusalem of His own initiative. Furthermore, He did not sneak into Jerusalem as a thief, but entered the city in a public way. When He drew close to Jerusalem, He prepared Himself to enter the city as a King. However, He did not enter the city as a king in splendor but as a King in humility. Instead of riding on a horse, He rode on a colt that sovereignly was made ready for Him.</p><p>How this colt was prepared for the Lord&rsquo;s use is a mystery. The Lord simply told two of His disciples, &ldquo;Go into the village opposite you, in which, as you are entering, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it&rdquo; (19:30). The Lord went on to tell the disciples that if they were asked why they were untying the colt, they should say, &ldquo;Because the Lord needs it&rdquo; (v. 31). The disciples went away and found the colt just as the Lord had told them. When they were asked why they were untying the colt, they replied, &ldquo;Because the Lord needs it&rdquo; (v. 34). Then they brought the colt to Jesus, &ldquo;and throwing their garments on the colt, they put Jesus on it&rdquo; (v. 35).</p><p>It may seem that the preparation of the colt was not a great matter. Actually, for the colt to be prepared in such a mysterious way was something great. Only the Creator of the universe could do such a thing. No doubt, the Lord Jesus is the real King. He spoke a brief word to His disciples concerning the colt. When they took His word and acted on it, everything happened exactly as He said it would.</p><p>Luke 19:37 and 38 say, &ldquo;And as He was already drawing near to the descent of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began, as they were rejoicing, to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen, saying, Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!&rdquo; The disciples who brought the colt to the Lord Jesus may have taken the lead to be excited, for they believed that the triumphant entry into the capital was for the purpose of taking over the country.</p><p>According to John 12, the raising of Lazarus was a great miracle that attracted people to the Lord. That miracle took place shortly before the feast of the Passover, which was the time for the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God to be put to death. Not long before He was killed, He raised Lazarus from the dead, and that miracle caused many to crowd around Him. Luke, however, does not record this miracle.</p><p>There was a great celebration as the Lord traveled from Bethany to Jerusalem. The temple in Jerusalem was built on Mount Moriah (later called Zion), the place where Abraham offered Isaac, and Bethany is located at the foothill of the Mount of Olives. Between these two mountains there is a valley. I believe that as the Lord passed through this valley, He was followed by a long parade of celebration. Those in this celebration were excited and even beside themselves with joy. The Pharisees, who were not able to do anything about the situation, were greatly surprised. They said to one another, &ldquo;Behold, the world has gone after him&rdquo; (John 12:19).</p>
