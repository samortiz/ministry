Here two things are clearly mentioned: fellowship and the receiving of light. "There I will meet with thee." This is fellowship. "I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel." This is the receiving of light.</p><p>The one thing that occupied God's mind the most in the Old Testament was His tabernacle, which later became the temple. God has a great expectation, a great goal, which is to dwell with His people. God's desire is to tabernacle among men. The greatest item in God's eternal plan is God dwelling among men. God desires to have a meeting place between Himself and man. Therefore, when the Lord Jesus became flesh, He tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth. His purpose was to dwell among us (John 1:14). The word Emmanuel shows that God dwells among men. But the Lord Jesus was only one man. This could not satisfy God's heart. He desires to build us up through His own Spirit to be the dwelling place of God in spirit (Eph. 2:22).</p><p>The center of the tabernacle and the temple was the ark. Whenever the ark left the tabernacle, the tabernacle was rejected. Whenever the ark was captured and taken away from the temple, the temple could no longer be God's dwelling place. God dwelt with man upon the ark, and man fellowshipped with God through the ark. We will not cover everything about the ark, because that is too great a subject. We will only concentrate on the mercy seat upon the ark and the two cherubim wrought of gold which were upon the mercy seat. God intended to speak and to commune with Moses from the midst of the two cherubim on the mercy seat. We need to realize that God fellowships with man from the midst of the two cherubim on the mercy seat; He speaks to man and man receives light from Him from the midst of the two cherubim on the mercy seat.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>The mercy seat is the place where God bestows His grace. On the day of propitiation, the tenth day of the seventh month, the blood of the sin offering was brought to the mercy seat (Lev. 16:14-15). The mercy seat is the place for the propitiation of sins. God's grace comes to man only after the propitiation of sin. If man is not propitiated for, he can never receive mercy from God. On the golden mercy seat, there must be the sprinkling of the blood of the sin offering before God can bestow grace to man. There is a human thought that since God has the authority to bestow grace, he can bestow grace any time He wants and grant mercy any time He wants. God does have the goal of bestowing grace. This is the reason He set up the mercy seat. But we must realize that without the day of propitiation every year, in which the high priest sprinkled the blood on the mercy seat, God could not forgive anyone's sin.</p><p>On the two ends of the mercy seat were the cherubim, and God's glory was on the cherubim (Ezek. 9:3; Heb. 9:5). One touches God's mercy on the mercy seat, and one touches God's glory in the midst of the cherubim. God must bestow His grace in such a way that it matches His glory. God cannot have the mercy seat without the cherubim; He cannot bestow grace from the mercy seat without passing through the cherubim. God can be gracious to us, and He desires to deal with us in grace. However, He cannot deal with us through the mercy seat alone; He must also deal with us through the cherubim. We have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Man can no longer come up to the standard of God's glory. If God dealt with us according to His glory, none of us would be eligible to receive His grace. We would only be qualified to be cursed; we could not receive mercy. Therefore, the blood of propitiation must be the sprinkling of the blood of propitiation upon the mercy seat before God can deal with us in glory and upon the mercy seat.</p><p>This shows us that our fellowship with God is based on our compatibility with His glory; it is based on our matching the glory of God. This compatibility comes from the blood. Because of the blood, God is able to bestow grace without sacrificing His glory. God's children need to remember that those who come to God must not fall short of His glory. If you come to God and what you bring in falls short of God's glory, you will not be able to fellowship with Him, and you will not be able to stand up before Him. Since the basis of fellowship is the glory of God, if anyone has a problem with God, it means that he has fallen short of the glory of God. Many brothers and sisters often say that the basis of fellowship is the blood. But we have to remember that the blood is the basis of fellowship because the basis of fellowship is God's glory. Without God's glory, there would be no need for the blood. We need the blood when we fellowship with God because He is a God of glory.</p><p>Romans 3 says that man has fallen short of the glory of God because of his sins (v. 23). At the same time, it says that the blood of Jesus justifies us (vv. 25-26). God is a God of glory. Therefore, all those who come to God must remember that their fellowship with God depends on their relationship with God's glory. Anything that does not give glory to God is a sin, and anything that falls short of God's glory is also sin. Sin takes away our fellowship with God. We do not have to sin consciously to lose our fellowship with God, and we do not have to commit gross sins before our fellowship with God is cut off. As long as we do not actively glorify God in a matter, our fellowship with God is damaged. We must remember that the basis of our fellowship with God is His glory. We must also note that man's fellowship with God is based on glory and also on the blood. God's glory demands that there be the blood. If we had not fallen short of God's glory, we would not need the blood. The reason we need the blood is because we have fallen short of God's glory. Glory is the basis of fellowship, and the blood is there to make up our lack.</p><p>We must realize that fellowship is frustrated when there is sin. But sin is still the negative reason; it has not touched the crux of the issue. The crux of the issue is the glory of God. Whenever we fall short of God's glory, and whenever we cannot attain to God's glory, fellowship is frustrated. Thank the Lord that there is the blood of the cross upon God's mercy seat today. Through the blood, we can look up to God's glory and live in His glory. Thank the Lord that His propitiation has put us in a position where we can behold God's glory with unveiled face. This is the meaning of fellowship. Fellowship is not spending half an hour to an hour studying the Bible or praying. Fellowship is beholding God's glory through the blood and having a life that is totally for His glory.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
