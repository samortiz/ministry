   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In remembering that every servant of God has his own special characteristic and function to God, we should not forget that, no matter how different one's function may be, all true servants of God are alike in this respect: They are interested, intensely interested, in men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If a brother has an enlarged heart and is interested in men, his usefulness in the hand of God will be greatly enhanced.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be interested in men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are indifferent to and disinterested in men, how can we preach the gospel to them?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are here to deal with men, to gain them, and to save them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have no interest in men, how can we accomplish our task?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No doctor should shrink away from sick patients, and no teacher should shrink away from students.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is strange indeed for us to be preachers of the gospel and to be afraid of meeting people at the same time!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to work for the Lord, we must be interested in men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This must not be something out of compulsion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must have an interest in contacting people, in communicating with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There should not be the need for anyone to tell us to contact or communicate with men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A worker should feel in his heart that man is lovable and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that all men were created by God and are loved by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God wants them, and He gave His only begotten Son for them with the expectation that they would receive His life through believing into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only difference we have with unbelievers is that we have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why we have to help them to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must cultivate a great interest in them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do this, we will find a boundless field of service opening up to us, and under the mercy of God we will become servants who are of some account to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, in order to serve the Lord in a proper way, we have to take the straight pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please remember that in the eyes of God, everyone has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this respect everyone is equal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone ranks the same because everyone has a soul and a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as we touch a person with a soul and a spirit, we should love him and strive to serve him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do this, our attitude will be different every time we meet a person on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When a man is enlightened by God to see that he is begotten by the same Father as his brothers, he develops a special taste for them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A worker similarly has to be enlightened to see that he is created by the same God as his fellow men.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This light will cause him to have a different taste every time he meets someone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Among the saints, we do have the feeling that we are brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we need a further enlightening to see that among all men, we are fellow men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone is precious and lovable, and everyone is worthy of our service.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have this attitude, we will touch the things of God while living on earth today, because God's attention is always directed towards man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Men were created by God, and from such God-created men, we can rescue some into His church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's goal is the church, but God's attention is still on man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He wants to gain man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No worker of the Lord can despise any person with a soul and a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we despise any man in attitude or in conduct, we are unworthy to be called servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we want to serve the Lord in a proper way, we must not despise any soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, we have to learn to be servants to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to learn to render others service in all things and to serve them with a willing heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people have the habit of despising those who seemingly are inferior to themselves while flattering those who seemingly are better than themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is shameful for such things to be found among God's workers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not despise those who seemingly are under us in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should consider a man's position according to God's worth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not deal with this matter, we cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a great and joyful thing for us to realize man's worth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we see how the Lord has died for men, we will echo that very character that led Him to suffer such a death for men; we will feel what the Lord feels and conclude that man does deserve all of our love and interest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Unless we can do this, we will not be able to identify with the Lord's feeling, and we will not be able to work for the Lord.</S>
