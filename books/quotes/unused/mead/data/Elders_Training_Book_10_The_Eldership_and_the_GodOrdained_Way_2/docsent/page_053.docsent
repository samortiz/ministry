   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To take care of this case of heresy, we need the experience of abiding in the Lord according to His anointing, and we should charge the believers not to listen to the heretical teaching, but to take care of the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>XXXVI.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE TEST OF THE SPIRIT THAT</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The antichrists are out of the world; the believers are out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believers have overcome the false prophets in verse 1 and the antichrist in verse 3, because greater is He who is in the believers than he who is in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To confront such a case of heresy, we need the experience of 1 the Triune God as the all-inclusive, anointing Spirit, who is in us, being greater than Satan as the evil spirit who is in the world, and 2 the world having been overcome by us through the indwelling Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>XXXVII.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By so doing, he will give life to such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To give life to such a one is to minister life to the sinning one in our contacting of him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This requires us to have a certain amount of the divine love to care for the sinning one, and to have a certain degree of growth in the divine life that we may have the riches of the divine life to share with him.</S>
