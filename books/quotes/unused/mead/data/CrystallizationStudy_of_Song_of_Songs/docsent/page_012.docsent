   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MUTUAL SATISFACTION WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to see how the Christ-seeker goes on to experience being satisfied with Christ mutually in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the beginning she was seeking her personal satisfaction, but then she was taught to seek satisfaction mutually with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is our spiritual satisfaction personal or mutual?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, it has to be personal; then gradually it has to be mutual with the very Christ whom we seek for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not be seeking our personal satisfaction so much that we forget about Christ s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we satisfy Him, we surely will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If Christ has not been satisfied by us, we can never be satisfied by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This satisfaction is mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A FEAST AS THE EXPRESSION OF THE INITIAL RESULT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>OF THE MUTUAL GAIN AND ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OF CHRIST AND HIS LOVER IN THE CHURCHES Christ as the King Feasting</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>with His Lover at the Table</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The lover of Christ is brought to a feast as the expression of the initial result of the mutual gain and enjoyment of Christ and His lover in the churches 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the host, and His lover is the main guest to show their mutual enjoyment and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ spreads a feast for the lover and her companions to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Love of His Lover toward Him as Spikenard</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Spreading Forth Its Fragrance</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ as the King is feasting with His lover at the table, and the love of His lover toward Him as spikenard spreads forth its fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The feast is fragrant, and the spikenard is even more fragrant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The invited one would say, Host, thank You for Your feast.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the Host would say to the invited one, Dear guest, thank you for your spikenard.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is mutual enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether or not we can have some spikenard to satisfy Christ depends upon whether or not we have that kind of love toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The spikenard is the lover s, but the fragrance is Christ s. Christ s fragrance is expressed by the lover in her spikenard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our experience of Christ should be constituted into spikenard.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, we have nothing to contain the fragrance of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, Christ satisfies us so that we gain the spikenard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we satisfy Christ by His fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a mutual enjoyment for a mutual satisfaction is in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we want to feast with Christ, we need the other church members.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ would not go to the feast by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At least we have to invite another five or seven to come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will have a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I am concerned that in our small group meetings, there is no feast with no table, spikenard, or fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE LOVER S GAIN AND ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word gain is very strongly used by Paul in Philippians 3, where he expresses his aspiration to gain Christ v. 8 . We need to see how to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a Bundle of Myrrh</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>and a Cluster of Henna Flowers</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Built upon the Fountain of His Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The lover gained Christ as a bundle of myrrh S.S. 1:13a , signifying Christ s sweet death for her, and as a cluster of henna flowers, signifying Christ in His resurrection in the churches built upon the fountain of His redemption v. 14 . If we are going to gain Christ, we must gain Him in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ today is in His death, in His resurrection, and in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To gain Christ is to gain Him in His death, His resurrection, and His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His Spirit is in our spirit, His Spirit is the reality of His resurrection, and His resurrection always implies His death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These three the death, the resurrection, and the Spirit of Christ always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have the death of Christ, we have His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we have His resurrection, we have His Spirit, who is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may say that we have exercised our spirit quite often, but when we exercise our spirit, do we receive Christ s death and resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because of his quick disposition, a brother may be bothered by his slow wife.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then the Lord may say to him, When you die with Me, you gain Me. If he would take this word, immediately he will enjoy Christ in His death as a bundle of myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The next morning he will be very refreshed with Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then when he comes to the meeting, the Spirit of Christ will be in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Spirit is constituted with Christ s death plus Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We gain Christ through His death and resurrection in His Spirit, and this Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The lover enjoys Christ as a bundle of myrrh between her breasts in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is Christ in His death for her to embrace privately 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then she enjoys Christ as a cluster of henna flowers, which is Christ in His resurrection for her to express openly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This cluster of henna flowers is in the vineyards of En-gedi v. 14 . En-gedi means the fountain of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This signifies that Christ in His resurrection in the churches is built upon the fountain of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This fountain, which is through Christ s redemption, is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the night we embrace Christ as a bundle of myrrh in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the morning we wear Him as a cluster of henna flowers in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This resurrection is in the church built upon the fountain of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here are the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the way that we gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Through the experience of His death and resurrection in His Spirit we gain Him.</S>
