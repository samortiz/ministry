   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Tsinan, Shantung Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You must be worrying about us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank God that we can love each other in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are still safe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, all of Tsinan is peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not lack any necessities, but there is some inflation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It costs about five dollars for a sack of flour, but God has not allowed us to lack physically.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do feel very dry spiritually, however.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because there are too few meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not convenient to meet at night, and we must work during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our gospel meeting on the Lord's Day is not so good because we dare not open the gate and invite many people to come listen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have the table meeting in the afternoon to remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everyone is very discouraged because the work is not prospering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we were in this kind of situation in the past, we could get the help from workers or brothers and sisters from outside, but now all fellowship with the outside has stopped except through letters and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please pray much for us and the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps God wants us to learn a lesson during this time that we have not had the opportunity to learn before.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May the Lord lead us with the Holy Spirit and grant us a view of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We see so many living dead people here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Almost everyone is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we think of the Lord's marvelous grace and His death and resurrection for men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The two things are such a contrast.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are compelled to inquire of the Lord concerning the way to begin the gospel work here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Should we be bold or should we go slowly?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Should we do it little by little in the meetings or shout it out loudly outside?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord give us a heart of wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the brothers and sisters feel dry because there is no one to rise up to teach and shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can only rise up ourselves and strive along with God there are not many who will strive .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps this is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you strive with God, this striving will certainly produce positive results.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a few are willing to strive before God and continue to pray, revival will be waiting at the corner Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I see so many who are dry; some have even fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Water from a waterbag is exhausted quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if God opens our eyes, we will see the springs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Gen 21:15-19; Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>15:18-19 Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can only ask God to care for those whom He has redeemed with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have had news from Tsingtao, Peking, and Tientsin but have heard nothing from the brothers and sisters in Tsou County.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you have any news of Brother Liu Tien-min, Brother Chen Buo-heng, and Brother Sun Shi-bih?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have not received any news from them for several months.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We hope someone who knows about them will tell us Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>O Lord, may You come quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I received a letter from Brother Sung Jing-sheng of Kuang- Rao.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He said, "It is very peaceful here now.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The brothers and sisters are all safe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are still some who fled to the countryside who have not returned, but all are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Mr. Nieh of Mao-Wang Village Brother Dao-hung and the brothers and sisters there are all well.</S>
