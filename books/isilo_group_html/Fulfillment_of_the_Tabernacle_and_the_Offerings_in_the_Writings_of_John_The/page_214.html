How does Christ as the Bridegroom obtain His bride? The best way to answer this question is to refer to the clear type in the Old Testament. Ephesians 5 reveals that Adam producing Eve to be his wife is a type of Christ producing the church to be His counterpart.<p>Genesis 2:20 says, &#8220;Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.&#8221; The living creatures were brought to Adam, and he named them, but he did not find among them a counterpart. Therefore, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and then He took a rib and built a woman and brought her to him. When Adam saw the woman, he said, &#8220;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man&#8221; (Gen. 2:23).<p>As the last Adam, Christ obtained His wife in a similar way. He &#8220;slept&#8221; on the cross, and while He slept His side was pierced. The water that flowed out of His pierced side signifies His resurrection life, which is typified by the unbroken bone. By this unbreakable resurrection life the church is produced and built up. The church, then, is Christ&#8217;s Eve. It is in this way that Christ, the Bridegroom, gains His bride, the church.<p>We have emphasized the fact that John 12:24 reveals that Christ as a grain of wheat did not remain alone. Instead, He fell into the ground and died, and then He rose up to produce many grains. Where in the Gospel of John do we find the fulfillment of this verse? The fulfillment is in 19:34. Through the piercing of the Lord&#8217;s side to release the flow of His life the Lord&#8217;s word in 12:24 was fulfilled.<p>John 3:29 and 12:24, two great verses, have been fulfilled. The many grains have been produced to form the church, and the church is the bride to match the wonderful Christ as the Bridegroom. Only in the Gospel of John, not in Matthew, Mark, or Luke, do we see these mysterious divine matters. Here we have the depths of the truth in John&#8217;s Gospel, the extract of the divine record in this book.<p>We have seen that when the Lord was dying on the cross, He was working for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s purpose. Eventually, His work on the cross issued in the outflow of His resurrection life to produce us as the many grains and the many members to form His Body. The Lord&#8217;s Body is also His wife, His counterpart to match Him. The church as Christ&#8217;s counterpart, therefore, is produced through His death and by His resurrection life.<h2 class=head1>THE SIGN OF THE BINDING LINEN SIGNIFYING THE OLD CREATION TO BE BURIED WITH THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST</h2><p>John 19:40 says that Joseph from Arimathea and Nicodemus &#8220;took then the body of Jesus and bound it in linen with the spices, as it is the custom of the Jews to bury.&#8221; This also is a sign. The binding of the Lord with linen signifies that the old creation was buried with the crucified Christ.<p>Suppose Joseph and Nicodemus only buried the Lord with the spices and did not bind the Lord&#8217;s body with linen. In that case, after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection nothing would have been left in the tomb. Then Peter and the other disciples, seeing the empty tomb, might have thought that someone had stolen His body. There would not have been a sign of His resurrection. But as we shall see more fully when we come to chapter twenty, the disciples saw in the tomb the linen cloths with which the Lord&#8217;s body had been bound. This caused them to realize that the Lord Jesus had resurrected from the dead. Even more important is the fact that the linen signifies the old creation, which was buried with the Lord Jesus and left in the tomb when He resurrected. I believe that this is the main significance of the Lord being bound with linen.<p>God is sovereign, and every matter related to the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion happened under God&#8217;s sovereignty. God even prepared Joseph and Nicodemus, honorable men, to bind Him with linen as a sign that the old creation was buried with the crucified Christ. When He was buried, He was not buried alone, but was buried with the old creation. When He was resurrected, He left the old creation, signified by the linen, in the tomb. Then He came forth as the Head of the new creation with the ability to impart His divine life, which had been released through His death, into His disciples. In this way, His disciples became His brothers (20:17). These many brothers are also the many grains for the Lord&#8217;s glorification. Therefore, the old linen was left in the tomb, and outside the tomb, in resurrection, we have the Lord, the elder Brother, and the many brothers forming the new creation. This new creation was made possible through the Lord&#8217;s marvelous all-inclusive death. Praise the Lord for what He accomplished through His all-inclusive death!<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_213.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_215.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 214</div><br></body></html>
