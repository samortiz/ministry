   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE GRACE, MERCY, AND BLESSING Scripture Reading: Heb 4:14-16 GOD S WILL BEING CONTRARY TO MAN S CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Few Bible readers understand the book of Job Job was written from the standpoint of human adversities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Job was written on the human level, but it also reveals God s intention for man in his adversities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the end of the book of Job God comes in and says that all the words spoken by Job and his three friends were words without knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, their words are frequently quoted by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, Job 22:21-28 often is quoted: Be well disposed to Him and at peace with Him; / By such, good will come upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>/ Receive instruction from His mouth, / And lay up His words in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>/ If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>/ If you put injustice far away from your tents, / And place your gold nuggets in the dust / And your gold of Ophir in the stones of the brooks, / Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets / And precious silver to you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>/ For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, / And you will lift up your countenance to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>/ You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; / And you will repay your vows.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>/ You will also decree something, and it will be established for you; / And light will shine on your ways.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was spoken by Eliphaz the Temanite.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Job responded to these words and said, Today also my complaint is bitter; / My stroke is heavy because of my groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>/ Oh that I knew where I might find Him, / That I might come to His seat!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>/ I would present my cause in order before Him, / And I would fill my mouth with arguments 23:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people consider the portion spoken by Eliphaz to be very good, and they like to quote it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, they do not realize that at the end of the book of Job God judged the words spoken by Job and his three friends.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God said that their words darkened His counsel, His will, and that their words were without knowledge 38:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may ask what is God s will and why does God regard the words that we consider to be wonderful as words without knowledge that darken His will?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This illustrates the problem that Christians have in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God desires to give man grace, mercy, and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, man has the thought that he must be pious and accomplish something for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With regard to this, we can obtain help from the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most of the psalms were written by David, who is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From David s life we see that if a person is strong, God will break his strength; if a person is perfect, God will break his perfection; and if a person is capable, God will break his capability.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All human concepts, thoughts, and doctrines counsel people to be strong, perfect, and capable before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the Bible shows that God always breaks those who are strong, perfect, and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This does not mean that we should now be weak, imperfect, or incapable before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we should consider only whether God can supply us with grace, mercy, and blessing, not whether we are strong, perfect, or capable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a question of whether in our strength and perfection God can supply us with grace, mercy, and blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If this is the case, our concepts will not be a hindrance to God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible is the utterance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the words of the Bible passed through men and were often written in the midst of human sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, there are several veils that can cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The snacks we purchase are a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are covered by a layer of wrapping paper, but the wrapping paper is not the snack.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some words in the Bible are like wrapping paper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the book of Job there are some snacks, but they have many layers of wrapping paper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we read the Bible, it is not easy for us to differentiate which words are wrapping paper and which words are snacks.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is easy for us to remove the wrapping paper, considering it to be the main content.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The debates in the book of Job are wrapping paper, but it is not easy for us to discern this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, it is not easy to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are often influenced by our natural concepts when we read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to our concept, we think that God wants us to be strong, perfect, and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not realize that these things are a hindrance to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God desires that we come to the throne of grace so that we can receive mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>GRACE BEING GOD REACHING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Regrettably, few people know what grace and mercy are.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Grace is God working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, our ability to believe is grace, and this is God worked into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Grace does not mean that God does something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, grace is what God is and what God has done reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The disciples were regarded as uneducated men and laymen from Galilee Acts 2:7; 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their standing up to speak for the Lord was grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>None of the disciples could boast that they were educated or eloquent, nor could they be proud, because they knew that it was God s grace that enabled them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Their ability to speak, their eloquence, and their boldness were the result of God working Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was altogether a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The disciples did not have any education, nor were they bold.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They were uneducated laymen, and they were timid.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was God s grace that they spoke for Him with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, grace is not something that we have, that we are able to do, or that we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Grace is God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God s reaching us can be compared to being struck by electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not that we reach the electricity but that electricity reaches us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Grace is God reaching man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may need to learn many lessons in order to know grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Sometimes we may feel that a brother does not know grace and that he never feels the need for grace, because he is strong, bold, eloquent, and able to give messages.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may not know what grace is, because we live and work according to our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Most of what we do is according to our ability.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Grace is God as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In 2 Corinthians 12 Paul said that he had a thorn in his body so that he would not be lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He prayed three times, asking the Lord to remove the thorn, but the Lord said, My grace is sufficient for you v. 9 . The Lord seemed to be saying, I will not remove the thorn, because if I do, you will depend on your strength and not on grace.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This thorn is to help you sense your weakness and your need for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You need Me as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Grace involves nothing of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Grace is God becoming everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Grace is God and all that He is becoming our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we lack eloquence, grace is God coming to be our eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we lack ability or wisdom, grace is God coming to be our ability and wisdom.</S>
