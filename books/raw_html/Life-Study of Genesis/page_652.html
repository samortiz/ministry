<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>BEING MATURED<br>THE REIGNING ASPECT OF THE MATURED ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><P>To many readers of the book of Genesis, the stories of Joseph are like the stories told to kindergarten children. However, we must remember that in the book of Genesis the seeds of nearly all the spiritual truths are sown. Whether the record of Joseph is merely a series of kindergarten stories or the seeds of the divine truths depends upon our point of view in reading it. If we look at the record of Joseph's life from the point of view of a kindergarten child, we shall read it merely as a story for children. But if we see that Jacob had passed through so many tests and had become matured in life, we shall see that the record of Joseph is not merely a story, but a revelation of the reigning aspect of a matured saint. If we view the record of Joseph as being the reigning aspect of a mature saint, our understanding will be revolutionized. Genesis 42, therefore, which we shall consider in this message, is not a kindergarten story; it is part of the reigning aspect of a mature life.</P><P>What we see in the life of Joseph is the rulership of the Spirit. You may have heard of the regeneration of the Spirit, the conviction of the Spirit, the inspiration of the Spirit, the infilling of the Spirit, the anointing of the Spirit, the power of the Spirit, the light of the Spirit, and the life of the Spirit, but the term the rulership of the Spirit is something new. We all need to be under the rulership of the Spirit. This aspect of the Spirit is higher than any other aspect. It is even higher than the building of the Spirit. The rulership of the Spirit is the topstone, the capstone, of the structure of the teaching of the Spirit. The record of Joseph's life is a revelation of the rulership of the Spirit, for the rulership of the Spirit is the reigning aspect of a matured saint.</P><P>Two lines run throughout the record of Joseph's life: the line of Joseph as a type of Christ and the line of Joseph's personal life. We see these two lines in chapter forty-two. In order to have an adequate interpretation of this chapter, we need to consider both lines. We need to follow these two lines to the end of the record of Joseph's life. Both lines afford us light and nourishment. When I was a young Christian, I heard a great deal about Joseph being a type of Christ. However, what I heard only included the general points. Many details were left out, and certain chapters were even skipped. I also heard about Joseph's personal life, but the emphasis was mainly on those aspects of Joseph's life which could edify the young saints and teach them to be patient, forgiving, and loving. None of the messages I heard about Joseph used the term life. In this message we shall cover a number of matters pertaining to Joseph as a type of Christ. In the next message we shall consider more of Joseph's personal life. If we consider chapter forty-two carefully, we shall see that it gives a vivid portrait of Christ.</P>
