THROUGH THE BREAKING IN OUR ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p>It is not easy to speak of the truth and the experience of being put to death, because we are not like the Lord; He was always willing to stand in death. For this very reason God must raise up situations in our environment to deal with us. A person who desires to take the Lord as life cannot avoid the dealings from his environment; he should not expect his environment to be smooth. The more we seek the Lord, the more we should be prepared to be dealt with in our environment. People want to take the way of prosperity, but genuine Christians, those who are in God&rsquo;s hand, often do not have a smooth journey on the earth; they encounter many blows and much breaking. This is not God&rsquo;s mistreatment or His punishment; rather, this is because He loves us. He desires to live in us and to give Himself to us as our enjoyment, but there are many frustrations in us. Hence, when it is necessary, He uses our environment to deal with us so that we can be put to death. Our environment forces us to experience death.</p>
<p>Those who desire to follow the Lord, live by Him, take Him as life, and let Him live in them will not have an easy way. He knows our impurities and how much we live by our soul-life. Therefore, He stirs up our environment at appropriate times to touch certain matters and to put us to death. He uses our environment to put us to death in small things and in big things. The Holy Spirit not only operates to put us to death; He also rules over our environment to create a situation that compels us to die. Hence, we have the demand of death within and the compelling of death without; we must die.</p>
<p>We thank God that we have the Holy Spirit inwardly and our environment outwardly. The first half of Romans 8 speaks of the Holy Spirit, but the second half speaks of our environment. <em>All things work together for good to those who love God</em> refers to our being conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son; this is equivalent to taking God as life and expressing the image of God (vv. 28-29). The Spirit of life operates to make us sons of God. However, this is not enough. We also need outward matters and things in our environment to break us, to put us into the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The death of the Lord Jesus is a mold. This mold is to deny the self and let God live, to put the soul-life to death and live by God&rsquo;s life. The Holy Spirit uses all things and all matters in our environment to place us into the mold of the Lord&rsquo;s death. The longer we stay in this mold, the more we will be conformed to His death; we will deny the self, put our soul-life to death, and let God live out of us. Being conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death is what Paul pursued (Phil. 3:10). As those who live in the Lord&rsquo;s death, we will bear the putting to death of Jesus in our body (2 Cor. 4:10). The death of the Lord Jesus does a work of killing in us through our environment, and the result is that the life of the Lord Jesus is lived out of us (v. 11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BREAKING OF THE EARTHEN VESSEL<br />
FOR THE MANIFESTING OF THE TREASURE WITHIN</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:7 the apostle Paul says that God&rsquo;s life in us is a treasure and that we are earthen vessels. Then in verses 8 and 9 he says that the apostles were pressed on every side, unable to find a way out, persecuted, and cast down. The purpose of such experiences from our environment is for the death of the Lord Jesus to do a killing and breaking work in us so that the treasure within will manifest its surpassing power. This power is the power of resurrection, not the power of creation. The result of this manifestation is life in others (v. 12).</p>
<p>Indeed, even though we are earthen vessels, it is not so easy for us to be broken. From one perspective, we are fragile, and it is easy for us to get into trouble and to be damaged. But from another perspective, we are rather hard, strong, and impregnable, and it may require a substantial blow to break us. Hence, God often uses things in our environment to strike us. It is not that God chastises or disciplines us because we are wrong. The concept of chastisement and discipline is according to law and ethics. Paul was much better than you and me, but his suffering was worse than ours. It is not that God disciplined Paul severely and now disciplines us lightly. Nor is it that we need less discipline than Paul did. The purpose of the striking in our environment is entirely for God, the treasure, to manifest His surpassing power, His glorious life, from within us. Even though our outer man is decaying, our inner man is being renewed day by day (v. 16); the treasure within us is being manifested more from day to day. The momentary lightness of our affliction is working out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory (v. 17). This glory is the manifestation of God, the maturity of His life, and the manifestation of resurrection power. In order for this glory to be manifested, we must pass through all kinds of sufferings. May God have mercy upon us so that we would see that we need to die in order for God to be our life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
