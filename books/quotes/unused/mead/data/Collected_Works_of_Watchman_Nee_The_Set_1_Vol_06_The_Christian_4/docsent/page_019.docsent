   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus said, "For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" Matt 9:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He also said, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" Luke 19:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you are a righteous man, His coming is not to call, seek out, and save you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But He will save you if you admit that you are a sinner and are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Putting yourself in the position of a sinner is the first step in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although this tax collector was a sinner, who should have perished, he was saved because he did not pretend to be a person without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He admitted that he was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The renowned British preacher Spurgeon had a dream one night.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the dream he saw himself standing outside the gate of heaven, and a group of bright and glowing saints were standing in a line holding banners of victory, singing and marching through the gate of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As soon as they entered through the gate, Spurgeon heard many joyful voices and praises welcoming them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then he asked one angel, "Who are these ones who are so welcomed by heaven?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The angel answered, "They are the ancient prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Spurgeon said, "Alas, I am not a prophet, I am not worthy to enter in with them."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, another group also marched through the gate and received a great welcome.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He asked the angel again, "Who are they?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The angel answered, "They are the ancient saints."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spurgeon knew that he was not one of the ancient saints and felt unworthy to enter through the gate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A little later, another group came; they were the ancient martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Spurgeon dared not join in with them either.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, another group with a multitude much greater than the first three came.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Among this group Spurgeon recognized two people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One was the woman who anointed the Lord with ointment; the other one was the robber who was crucified with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Spurgeon thought that when this group entered into heaven it would be quiet, but to his great surprise, the welcome and applause was seven times greater than the welcome for the first three groups.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spurgeon asked, "Who are they?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The angel answered, "They are ones who were dead in sin and were made alive by the Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then Spurgeon rejoiced and said, "Praise be unto the Lord Jesus forever!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The people in this last group are my companions."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then he woke up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although this was a dream, it was real!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord of heaven welcomes sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first step the Holy Spirit takes in the heart of a man is to make him realize his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first step God takes in saving a sinner is to send His Spirit to work in his heart and convict him of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I once held a meeting in a certain place, and some grade-school girls were deeply moved by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They deeply realized that they were sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the meeting they waited for me to fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I saw that none of their eyes were dry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every one of them was sorrowful for her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They told me that they were very sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They knew that they were sinners but they did not know whether they could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I told them that knowing that they were sinners was proof of the Holy Spirit's working in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I then read John 3:16 and 5:24 and other promises to them and helped them realize that since they knew they were sinners, they could receive eternal life and be saved if they believed and received the Lord Jesus as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Holy Spirit opened their eyes and they experienced the salvation of the cross and the enjoyment of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They are still joyful and rejoicing in the Lord every day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, if this very hour the Holy Spirit shows you your sins, it is because He wants to save you, not because He wants to condemn your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This tax collector not only put himself in the position of a sinner; he was also genuinely grieved because of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He "beat his breast."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He hated himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When he considered how he committed sins in the past, sorrow uncontrollably rose up within him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was in anguish and beat his breast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Certainly those who overlook their sins and do not feel sorrowful for them will easily commit sins again.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret" 2 Cor 7:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible says that God dwells "with the contrite and lowly of spirit, / To revive the spirit of the lowly / And to revive the heart of the contrite" Isa 57:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: / a broken and a contrite heart, O God, / thou wilt not despise" Psa 51:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, dear sinners, it does not matter how great your sins are; what matters is that you do not want to admit that you are a sinner and feel sorrowful for your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you overlook your sins and refuse to put yourself in the position of a sinner, you will surely not seek after the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even if the Savior is sent to the door of your heart, you will not receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Actually, humbling yourself is not worth anything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Neither is putting yourself in the position of a sinner or being sorrowful for your sins worth anything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, unless a man humbles himself, unless he sees himself as a sinner, and unless he feels sorrowful for his sins, he surely will not seek after the Savior of sinners, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This tax collector's humbling of himself, acknowledging himself as a sinner, and sorrow for his sins could not save him; it could not give him eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These steps only prepared his heart to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The one and only reason this sinner was saved was because he believed the vicarious salvation of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even though he humbled himself, the humbling could not save him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even though he was sorrowful, the sorrow could not save him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though he confessed himself to be a sinner, the confession could not save him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even though all these prepared him to receive salvation, these could not save him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although without these you will perish, these things alone will not save you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A sinner is saved only through the salvation that the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross and not through anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He prayed, "God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!"</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Other ways to translate this phrase in the Greek text include: "God, make propitiation for me, a sinner!" or "God, allow me, a sinner, to be propitiated."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>No one can be saved without the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Perhaps when the tax collector was standing in the temple praying, the Holy Spirit moved his heart to convict him of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Perhaps he saw from far off the priest in the outer court offering sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He saw the sacrifices slain on behalf of the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, he asked God, "Make propitiation for me, a sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He knew he was a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He knew that there was a punishment for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>A sinner could never be justified or go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He also knew that if there was not a redeeming Savior for his sins, he would perish.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>His heart looked to the Savior; his heart looked to the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He cried out to God and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Surely heaven was his.</S>
