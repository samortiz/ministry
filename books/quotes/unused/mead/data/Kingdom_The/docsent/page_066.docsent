   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BIND AND LOOSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am very happy that Matthew 18:17-18 is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Roman Catholic Church says that the pope, as Peter's successor, has the sole authority to bind and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the local church is mentioned in Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you have a problem which two or three believers cannot settle, you should bring this problem to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church here certainly must be the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It cannot be the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the church in Matthew 18 is the universal church, where shall we find it when we have a problem that two or three believers cannot solve?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church in Matthew 18 is surely the local church, and the local church has the authority to bind and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew 16:19 the Lord Jesus told Peter that he had the authority to bind and loose, but in Matthew 18:18 the Lord changed the subject from singular to plural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew 16:19 says, "Whatever you singular, Gk. bind" and Matthew 18:18 says, "Whatever you plural, Gk. bind."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that we too have the power to bind and to loose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The authority that Peter had, we also have.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you seen your position?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have you seen your authority and rank?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all can bind and loose, just as Peter did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter was a stone, and we also are stones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter had authority to bind and loose, and we also have this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>FROM CLAY TO STONE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians have not seen the authority and the position which has been committed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if we are going to realize our position and authority, we must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were pieces of clay; we must become stones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By nature as a human being, Simon was clay, but the Lord Jesus changed his life and transformed his being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus not only changed Simon's name, but He also transformed his being into a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Jerusalem there is a piece of foundation stone with Peter's name on it Rev 21:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was no longer a piece of clay; he had become a foundation stone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter in the four Gospels was clay, often taking the lead in making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if you read the New Testament carefully, you will see that this muddy Peter was under the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Acts 1 Peter was no longer muddy; he had become a piece of transparent, precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the four Gospels Peter was somewhat opaque, but when he stood up in Acts 1, he was transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ONENESS BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some Christians insist upon the so-called Pentecostal experiences, saying that without them we cannot have the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How about Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before Pentecost had actually arrived, Peter was transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was so bold, strong, and positive, remaining in Jerusalem with one hundred and twenty, praying for ten days in one accord Acts 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One hundred and twenty people prayed for ten days in one accord without dissenting or disputing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do you doubt that they had the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the Holy Spirit they could not have done it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were Galileans who had given up their own country and were staying in Jerusalem in spite of the threatenings of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One hundred and twenty people prayed for ten days in one accord!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they did not have the Spirit, I am afraid they would have begun to fight after only ten hours.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Their being in one accord and continuing in prayer indicates they had the Spirit within them before the day of Pentecost.</S>
