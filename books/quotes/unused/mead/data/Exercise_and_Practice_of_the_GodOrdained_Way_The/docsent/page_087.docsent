   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PERFECTING WORK OF THE GIFTED PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Timothy 1:14 Paul charged Timothy to "guard the good deposit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Timothy had a deposit; something had been deposited into him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This deposit was the healthy words repeatedly given to Timothy by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Timothy had received all these healthy words into him as a kind of deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Timothy 6:20 Paul charged Timothy to "guard the deposit," and in his second Epistle he repeats this charge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then in 2 Timothy 2:2, Paul refers to "the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These "things" were the healthy teachings and healthy words that Timothy had heard from Paul 1 Tim 1:10; 6:3; 2 Tim 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul charges that these things, the good deposit in Timothy, be committed to faithful men, who would be competent to teach others also 2 Tim 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word "also" indicates that Timothy should teach and that there was the need for some others to teach also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, Paul was an apostle, a perfecter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He perfected a young man, Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This equipped Timothy with the good deposit and qualified him to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 2 Timothy 2:2 the first generation perfecter charges the second generation perfecter to perfect the third generation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 4 says that the Head has given some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a family all the young members under the age of eighteen have to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This perfecting has a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Ephesians 4:12 this goal is indicated by the word "unto."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This word in Greek means with a purpose or with a view to.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the perfecting of the saints is with a purpose or with a view to the work of ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The same word translated "unto" is used twice in this verse: "unto" the work of ministry and "unto" the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two phrases are in apposition to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The two refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The work of ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Not Directly by the Head</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ephesians 4 is a crucial chapter because it is the only chapter in the Bible which reveals that the Head of the Body does not build the Body directly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some have used the Lord's word in Matthew 16:18 "I will build My church" to teach that we do not need any persons to build us, but that we need only the Lord Jesus to build us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, the New Testament is not only Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are the four Gospels, Acts, twenty-one Epistles, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among the Epistles, the fourteen which were written by Paul, Romans through Hebrews, are placed first.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Among Paul's Epistles, Ephesians is a book specifically on the church, and chapter four is on the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the Lord says, "I will build My church" in Matthew 16, the entire Bible does not show us that Christ builds up His church directly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, chapter four of Ephesians unveils this matter in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is true that Christ is building up His church, but He is doing it as the Head by producing the gifted persons and giving them as gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are all gifts from the Head to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Gifts Produced by the Head</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ephesians 4 tells us that the Lord came down, not only to the earth, but He also descended into the lower parts of the earth, Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then He came out of Hades to the earth in His resurrection, and from the earth He ascended to the height, the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, He is the all-inclusive Christ who fills all in all vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As such a Head, He has received gifts from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to John 17:2 and 6, the Father has given His chosen ones to the Son that the Son may give them eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the time Christ ascended to the heavens to show His freshness in resurrection to the Father John 20:17 , the Father gave all of the millions of people which He had chosen in eternity past as gifts to the Son Psa 68:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Immediately, some of these gifts became apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although Peter, James, John, and the others were appointed apostles before the Lord's death and resurrection, they were not constituted apostles yet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord needed to die, be resurrected, and then ascend into heaven to see the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the Father could give all the chosen ones, including Peter, James, and John, to the Son, and the Son could impart His resurrection life into them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By this they were constituted apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter was a fisherman with a very impulsive disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In his natural condition, he could have never been an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Peter was appointed as an apostle, but he was only qualified for fighting John 18:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>James and John, the sons of thunder, were qualified to fight to be the first among the Lord's disciples Matt 20:21, 24, 27 , but they were not qualified to be apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only through Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension can anyone be qualified to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In resurrection Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the Spirit of life, and in His ascension He was poured upon them as the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First, He breathed Himself into them; then He was poured out upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, on the day of Pentecost, Peter, James, John and the others all stood up as qualified apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They were not appointed only; they were qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They were qualified by being constituted with the resurrected Christ as the breath of life and with the ascended Christ as the power of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ascended Head constituted the gifts in this way and gave them to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first ten verses of Ephesians 4 describe the procedure through which the ascended Head constituted the gifts and gave them to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These gifts are for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
