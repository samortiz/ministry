   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Pillar on the Way to Bethlehem</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden in this message is the third pillar, the pillar on the way to Bethlehem 35:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At Bethel Jacob built an altar and set up a pillar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not only did he answer God's call; he also consecrated himself to God for the fulfillment of His desire to have Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, Jacob's life did not end at 35:15.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 16 says that he journeyed on from Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Jacob was journeying on, he had an experience that was a matter of both joy and suffering, a matter of both gain and loss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jacob gained a son, Benjamin, and he lost his beloved wife, Rachel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you had to make the choice, would you prefer to gain the son or to keep the wife?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to gain the son, you must sacrifice your wife, and in order to keep your wife, you must be denied the son.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although Jacob had eleven sons, not one of them was a full type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had had many experiences, but not one of them was adequate to bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, he was confronted with a choice to keep Rachel or to gain Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a crucial matter, and we all must face it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, the choice was not made by Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he had preferred to keep Rachel, he could not have done so.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, if he had wanted to reject Benjamin, he would not have been able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both the death of Rachel and the birth of Benjamin were in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Leah, the one Jacob did not love so much, had brought forth six sons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rachel, the object of Jacob's love, had brought forth only one son Joseph, whose name means "addition."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Joseph was born, Rachel expected to have a second son and said, "The Lord shall add to me another son" 30:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In her expectation of having another son, she seemed to be saying, "God has taken away my reproach and has given me a son.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But one son is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I want another one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, I shall call the name of my first son Joseph."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This should imply a prayer, a prayer answered at the cost of Rachel's life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rachel had such a prayer in 30:24, and the answer came in 35:18.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to gain her desire, Rachel had to lose her own life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 30:24 she did not actually realize what she was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rachel expected that God would give her a second son, but she did not know that this would cost her her life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many of us have done the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We prayed for a particular matter without knowing what it would cost to have our prayer answered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the time of the delivery of Rachel's second child, Jacob must have been happy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But he suddenly realized that Rachel, the desire of his heart, was dying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Benjamin was coming, but Rachel was departing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fact that the birth of Benjamin and the death of Rachel occurred simultaneously means that Jacob gained a son by losing his natural choice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The crucial point in this message is that Jacob gained Christ through the loss of his natural choice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The third pillar in Jacob's life was a testimony of God's dealing with his natural choice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is wonderful to have the testimony of God's care and the testimony of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But not even the house of God is God's ultimate goal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's ultimate goal is to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The expression of Christ is not an individual matter; it is a corporate matter in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church as the house of God is for the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to express Christ, we must have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, most Christians think they can express Christ without the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But it is impossible to express Christ adequately apart from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In addition to the pillar of God's care and the pillar of God's house, we must have the third pillar, the pillar for the corporate expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This pillar is costly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Genesis 35:20 says that Jacob set a pillar upon Rachel's grave, and that this "is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This grave marked the death of Jacob's natural choice, the choice of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rachel was the first person Jacob met when he arrived at Laban's home, and he immediately fell in love with her.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did everything necessary to have her as his wife, and eventually she was given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Rachel did not die of old age; she died prematurely in childbirth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fact that she was still able to bear children indicates that she was not in her old age.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All of Leah's six deliveries of her sons and the one of her daughter went very well, but Rachel died in giving birth to her second child.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Her death was allowed by God.</S>
