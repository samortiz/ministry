Our goal is to see what God says about time and how He numbers our spiritual days. One interesting thing is that in Genesis 4 and 5, which we have just read, there are two genealogies. In chapter four there is the genealogy of Cain; in chapter five there is the genealogy of Seth. Adam had three famous sons (although he had begotten more than three). They were Cain, Abel, and Seth. Abel died in his youth and had no genealogy. As for Adam's other two sons, the Bible records both of their genealogies. In chapters four and five we see two groups of people begetting generation after generation. One group, including Lamech and Tubal-cain, came out of Cain. The other group descended from Seth; Abraham, Moses, and Christ were all his descendants. You can see these two branches continuing to propagate. Cain's genealogy is recorded in chapter four, and Seth's genealogy is recorded in chapter five. They are similar. One genealogy tells us who begat whom, and who begat whom. The other also tells who begat whom, and who begat whom. However, there is one big difference. That is, in chapter four it only says that Cain begot Enoch, and Enoch begot Irad, and so forth. It does not tell us how many years Cain lived; there is altogether no record of their days on earth. Chapter five is different. Not only does it mention "births," but it also mentions "deaths" and the ages of the people. Hence, chapters four and five are not quite the same. Chapter four purposely does not record the ages, not because they are forgotten. Chapter five clearly records men's ages; it tells us who lived to what age, and begat whom, and then lived on for how many more years. Then it tells us the total number of years that such a person lived. We saw that Adam is recorded in chapter five. It says that he lived nine hundred thirty years. From Adam and Seth to Noah, the genealogy was clearly recorded. This is the basic difference between these two chapters.</P><P>Why is there this difference? In God's eyes, Cain had no years that could be countable. Perhaps he was married at age fifty, gave birth to a son at age sixty, and lived until he was six hundred years old. But God made no account of Cain and forgot him. In God's eyes, this person had never lived. He was dead. Even when he was living, he was still dead. Therefore, only his birth (which is equivalent to his death) was recorded, and his actual death was not recorded. Since he had not lived before God, there was nothing countable, and there was no death. Who do the men in chapter four represent? They represent those who have not been born again, those who are dead in Adam, have no life, and have no countable days. The men in chapter five represent those who are in the Lord. The name Seth means a replacement. Because Abel died, Seth was appointed to replace Abel. This shows that only those who are born again have countable days.</P><P>We have also read another verse, Exodus 12:2: "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you." God told the Israelites to rename their month. They were to rename the current month as their first month. Have you ever heard of people renaming the months? We have heard of the renaming of years but not of the renaming of months. For example, during the various Chinese dynasties, the years were named according to the name of the reigning monarch. When one king passed away, the name of the years was changed. When the Republic of China came into existence, the name of the year changed again. For example, today is the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. We call a year the first year because a new beginning has come. However, no one ever renames the months. Yet the Bible renamed the months. It might have been the fifth month, and God changed it to the first month. Why did He do this? He did it because the Israelites left Egypt, the Passover Lamb was slain, and the Israelites were freed from the hands of Pharaoh. Why did the months have to be renamed? They were renamed because this was the beginning of a spiritual history.</P><P>Do you have a spiritual history? Today among us some may be quite old; some may even have grandchildren. However, I want to ask you, have you been born again? If you have not been born again, in God's eyes you are not even a month old. You may be fifty or sixty years old physically, yet your first spiritual month has not started thus far! If the Israelites had not left Egypt, if they had not escaped from the bondage of Pharaoh, if they had not struck the blood on their door posts and escaped the punishment of God, they would not have had a first month before God. Therefore, the beginning of our spiritual history starts with the blood. Please remember that the day that you accept the precious blood is the day of your new beginning. If that day has not yet come, you have no days before God thus far. There is a question we always like to ask: "How many births do you have? How many births have you celebrated?" If you say only one, then I fear for you. You need two births. It is not bad for our wretched body (which becomes the temple of God after our regeneration) to have one birthday. However, we need another birthday. I am afraid that there are some of you who have had only one birth. Such people do not have a first month; they are like Cain who had no days before God. He could have lived for five hundred or seven hundred years, and he might have achieved many things, yet none of these are countable. When the Israelites were in Egypt, God did not count their days. The month they left Egypt was counted as their first month. Therefore, the counting of our spiritual days begins with our regeneration and salvation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
