   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BRINGING IN A SPIRIT OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all should be those who teach God's economy, who fan the gift of God into flame, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus, and who exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this point we need to consider another crucial matter being persons of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have no doubt that, as believers in Christ, you have received the eternal life and the divine Spirit, but I am concerned that you will go to your class with "ice water" instead of a flame.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have emphasized the fact that to have a flame you need to let the draft come in through opening up to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every morning you need to bring in the draft by fanning the gift of God into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, suppose that you have just had a most unpleasant situation with your spouse, and now it seems impossible for you to fan the flame.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It may take several days for you to be able once again to fan the flame by yourself, but this will be much easier to do if you pray with a small group of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you pray by yourself, you may keep thinking about the situation with your spouse and thus have no way to fan the flame.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if you pray with others, they will fan the flame within you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eventually you also will be able to pray and you will fan them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the draft will come in, and you will have a flame.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you would go to your class in the Summer School of Truth with a flame, you must be a person of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are such a person, you will bring a spirit of prayer to your class.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You will then be able to stir up the praying spirit of the young people in your class.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone must be stirred up to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that you need to create an atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not teach unless there is such an atmosphere in your class.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To have an atmosphere of prayer, you should allow an adequate time in every class session for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you know what a living meeting is?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A living meeting is a meeting that has an atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All those who speak for the Lord know that it is easy to speak in a meeting where there is an atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, it will be very difficult to speak, for you may feel as if you are speaking in a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would remind you that teaching in the Summer School of Truth is absolutely different from teaching in a secular school.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need to fan the gift of God into flame in order to teach a class in a secular school.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But to teach in our summer school, you must be a person of prayer, a person with a flame who brings in an atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TEACHING NOT IN A DOCTRINAL WAY BUT IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once you have fanned the gift of God into flame, stirred up the praying spirit, and created an atmosphere of prayer, you are now ready to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should teach not in a doctrinal way but in an experiential way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Applying All the Points of the Teaching to Practical, Personal Experience</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose you are teaching a lesson on man's fallen condition and man's need of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should not ask your students merely to remember and recite all the points related to man's fallen condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That would be to teach in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you would teach in an experiential way, you should help the young people to realize that they themselves are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You may ask them to paint a picture of their own fallen condition, not just to remember a number of doctrinal points.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Take, for example, the matter of lying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning this, those in your class should come to realize that, because they were born in sin, there is no need for them to learn how to lie; they lie spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To teach in this way is to teach not according to doctrine but according to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One of the points in the lesson on man's need of salvation is that man is under God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man has sinned by disobeying God's commandment and thus has come under God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you teach in a doctrinal way, you will ask questions such as the following: What is God's commandment?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What does it mean to be condemned?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is the significance of being under God's condemnation?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you would teach in an experiential way, you must help your students to realize that they have sinned by disobeying particular commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, you should point out to them that often they have disobeyed the demands of their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may ask them, "Can you say that you have never disobeyed your conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have disobeyed your conscience, then surely you have sinned."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By speaking to them in this way, you will help them to realize experientially what it means to be under God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Learn in your teaching to touch others experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Apply every point of your teaching to their personal, practical situation.</S>
