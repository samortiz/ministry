   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ISRAEL, A TYPE OF GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ELECT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Jeremiah also shows us that God's elect, Israel, was very much involved with the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a type of us, God's New Testament elect, who are very much involved with the world in its many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The nations in chapters forty-six through fifty-one typify nine different aspects of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today the world has even more aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jeremiah presents us such a picture so that we can live a church life that is not polluted by the different aspects of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to know how to have a clear separation from the world and not be wrapped up or mixed with any of its aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God will come in to judge the world in all its aspects and to make a clear distinction between the church as His elect and every aspect of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Galatians 6:16, we are today's Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Around us are all kinds of aspects of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to ask ourselves what aspect of the world we are involved with.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may be involved with the desire to help others through humanitarian efforts, or we may be occupied with the enjoyment of worldly amusements.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In either case, we are away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GOD'S VENGEANCE ON BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>HIS NUMBER ONE ENEMY,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE WORST NATION IN OFFENDING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Babylon was the nation that destroyed the nation of Israel, the people of Israel, the holy temple of God, the holy city of God, and the holy land of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition, the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar captured the holy vessels, which were used to serve God in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Other people regarded those vessels as something holy, sanctified, and separated unto God and therefore did not dare to touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, Nebuchadnezzar brought a great part of these vessels to Babylon and put them in the temple of his god Dan 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This insulted God to the uttermost and was the reason that God's verdict on Babylon is described as His vengeance Jer 50:15 , the "vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance for His temple" 51:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Babylon was the worst nation in offending God, and its king was one with Satan Isa 14:4, 11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Babylon, therefore, is God's number one enemy, being both the beginning and the conclusion of human government on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Babylon will be thoroughly condemned, punished, and judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God will judge Babylon to such an extent that nothing of Babylon will remain in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, when God destroys the restored religious and political Babylon the Great, He will rid the earth of His number one enemy, which rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>JEREMIAH PRESENTING GOD'S ECONOMY TO US</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THAT WE MAY TURN BACK TO OUR SOURCE AND ORIGIN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATERS</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jeremiah presents God's economy to us that we may turn back to our source and origin, the Triune God as the fountain of living waters Jer 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we will enjoy Him and will receive His dispensing into us for the accomplishment of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God will then take care to keep the world away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today in our church life there should not be anything Babylonian.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should clear away any rebellion against God, any exalting of ourselves, and any worshipping of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will be God's elect under His dispensing to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead of enjoying Egypt as a good place for our living, we will enjoy the Triune God, and the church life will be our living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In such a situation we will be blessed by God.</S>
