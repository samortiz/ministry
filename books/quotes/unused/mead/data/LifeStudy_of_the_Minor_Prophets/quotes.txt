[1]  With this message we begin the Life-study of the Minor Prophets except Zechariah, which we have covered in a separate series of messages .
[2]  2 The Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights implying resurrection for the salvation of God to all the sinners Jonah 1:17; 2:10; Matt 12:40-41 .
[3]  In these verses we see many things concerning Christ: His eternity, His incarnation in time, His death, burial, and resurrection for the spreading of God s redemption and salvation to all the nations on earth, His coming as the Desire of nations and as the Sun of righteousness, and His being the One dwelling on Mount Zion to be a shelter and a stronghold to God s elect.
[4]  Although these books are minor, they complete the divine revelation concerning God s economy in His dealings with His elect Israel and the nations, which is covered in detail in the books of the Major Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.
[5]  God s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, in His governmental dealing with Israel, and in His judgment upon the nations issues in the manifestation of Christ as the centrality and universality in God s economy to bring in the restoration.
[6]  Let us now go on to consider come crucial points in the Minor Prophets.
[7]  Amos 4:12 says, Prepare to meet your God, O Israel.
[8]  Sinners who repent and believe in Him will be forgiven of their sins and justified by God to have the divine life that they may walk in the divine light and become the mighty ones of Christ, sent with Him by God in His second appearing Amos 4:12; Micah 7:18-19; Hab 2:4; Micah 7:8-9; Joel 3:11b .
[9]  THE SYMBOL OF A WIFE OF HARLOTRIES A. The Prophet Hosea
[10]  This symbolized that God took Israel as His wife one who gave herself to harlotries and who departed from Jehovah.
[11]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE THREE ON HOSEA 2 THE SYMBOL OF A WIFE OF HARLOTRIES 2 Scripture Reading: Hosea 2:2 3:5
[12]  In this message we will continue to consider the symbol of a wife of harlotries.
[13]  Even though God will hedge her up and build up a wall against her, blocking her way, she will not return to Him but instead will pursue her lovers, her idols.
[14]  Jehovah will make a covenant for Israel in that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of heaven, and the creeping things of the earth v. 18a . Just as God made for us a covenant with the living things at Noah s time, so He will make such a covenant for Israel at the time of restoration.
[15]  God s chastisement and punishment will issue in the manifestation of Christ, and the manifestation of Christ will bring in the age of restoration, the millennial kingdom, which ushers the old and ruined universe into the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem.
[16]  Verse 6a tells us that God s people the priests would be destroyed because of a lack of that knowledge of God mentioned in verse 1.
[17]  The people of Israel did not know God s regulations, and the priests also lacked that knowledge.
[18]  God will reject the priest, for he has rejected that knowledge of God v. 6b . Thus, he will no longer be a priest to God.
[19]  Hence, Jehovah said that He would change their glory in their multiplication into shame v. 7 . This indicates that as God s priests, His serving ones, we need to be careful, for our service involves our children.
[20]  Verse 5 says that the pride of Israel testifies to his face and that Ephraim and Israel would stumble in their iniquity.
[21]  The manifestation of Christ is a long process which began with Christ s coming to mankind, and even into mankind, at His incarnation and which will continue until Christ s coming back.
[22]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE FIVE ON HOSEA 4 THE SINS OF ISRAEL IN FORSAKING JEHOVAH
[23]  Chapters seven and eight of Hosea cover the sins of Israel in forsaking Jehovah and Jehovah s punishments on Israel because of their forsaking of Him.
[24]  They do not realize that God s present chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations will issue in the manifestation of Christ to bring in the restoration.
[25]  Like an eagle the enemy would come against the house of Jehovah, because they had trespassed Jehovah s covenant Jehovah s binding of Israel in His holy requirements and righteous terms and because they had transgressed against Jehovah s law Jehovah s regulating of Israel according to what He is: love, light, holiness, and righteousness 8:1 .
[26]  In this message we will consider from Hosea 9 and 10 the matters of the idolatry of Israel against Jehovah and the punishments of Jehovah upon Israel.
[27]  Hosea s thought here is very deep because it indicates God s organic union with His people.
[28]  The fruit of the vine should have been offered to God as a drink offering, but they used the vines to bring forth fruit for themselves, not for God.
[29]  These chapters are concerned with Jehovah s unchanging love versus Israel s stubborn unchastity.
[30]  In the womb he grasped his brother by the heel v. 3a; Gen 25:26 . Jacob fled into the country of Aram; / And Israel served for a wife, / And for a wife he kept sheep Hosea 12:12; Gen 29:20, 30; 31:38-41 . In his full strength he contended with God Hosea 12:3b . Indeed he contended with the Angel Christ and prevailed; / He wept and made supplication to Him v. 4a; Gen 32:24-32 .
[31]  In his hand were balances of deceit, and he loved to extort v. 7 . Ephraim said, I have surely become rich; / I have found wealth for myself.
[32]  / In all my labors / They will find with me / No iniquity, which would be sin v. 8 . In Ephraim s hands were two kinds of balances: one that weighed light for buying and one that weighed heavy for selling.
[33]  The son Jezreel symbolized that God would avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel 2 Kings 10:1-11 upon the house of Jehu and would bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel 2 Kings 15:10-12 .
[34]  God used Hosea s marriage to Gomer and his family to demonstrate how Israel as a wife to Jehovah had become unfaithful to her Husband.
[35]  But when God s everlasting love is touched, Israel is called God s son Exo 4:22-23 , indicating that Israel has the Father s life.
[36]  God s love in teaching Ephraim to walk and in taking Ephraim in His arms shows us that God s love is divine but on a human level.
[37]  Hosea 11:8 and 9 reveal that Jehovah could not give Ephraim up.
[38]  / I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; / I will not return to destroy Ephraim; / For I am God and not man, / The Holy One in the midst of you, / And I will not come in wrath.
[39]  Jehovah will ransom them from the power of Sheol; He will redeem them from death v. 14a . Hence, the next part of the verse says, Where are your plagues, O death? / Where is your destruction, O Sheol? Repentance will be hidden from His eyes v. 14c . God s love for Israel is everlasting, and He will never repent of this love.
[40]  / I am like a green fir tree; / From Me your fruit is found v. 8b . Jehovah s being like a green fir tree symbolizing God s being living and evergreen and Ephraim s bearing fruit from Him indicates Ephraim s oneness with Jehovah.
[41]  Many of the riches in this book are not directly stated but rather are implied by Hosea s poetic writing.
[42]  The three matters in these verses that imply Christ are God s calling His son out of Egypt, His drawing Israel with the cords of a man, and His gently causing them to eat.
[43]  This verse implies Christ in His union with Israel as the Son of God and as the One called out of Egypt by God.
[44]  The fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ in this verse is in Matthew 2:15, which speaks of Christ s being called out of Egypt by God.
[45]  A further implication of this verse is that with Christ we, the believers in Christ, are also sons of God Heb 2:10 .
[46]  Regarding Christ as the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of His being the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of His being the firstborn Son of God.
[47]  This means that in His resurrection not only was Christ born to be the firstborn Son of God, but also in His resurrection we were regenerated and born to be the many sons of God, His many brothers, to be His members for the constitution of the organic Body of Christ.
[48]  If Christ had not been incarnated, if Christ had not lived on earth, if Christ had not died a vicarious death for us, if Christ had not entered into resurrection and then ascended to the heavens, there would be no way for God to draw us with cords of a man, with bands of love.
[49]  We need to be impressed with the fact that Christ s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are all for us, for it is by all these steps of Christ s humanity that God s love in His salvation reaches us.
[50]  THE DAY OF JEHOVAH Scripture Reading: Joel 1:1, 15; 2:1, 11, 31, 3:14
[51]  The subject of the book of Joel is the devastation of the human government on Israel in four stages and the destruction of Christ over the devastators and His reign among Israel in the restoration Rev 20:4, 6; Matt 19:28 .
[52]  The central thought of Joel is that the nations, as the locusts, devastate Israel consecutively in four empires, from Nebuchadnezzar, the first king of Babylon, to Antichrist, the last Caesar of Rome; they will be overcome and terminated by Christ, who will set up the kingdom and reign among the saved Israel in the age of restoration.
[53]  Acts 10:42 tells us that Christ is the One who has been designated by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead, and 17:31 says that God has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated.
[54]  Because of this desolation, there were no food to feed the people and no wine to cheer the people Joel 1:5, 7, 10-12, 16a, 17 , no meal offering and no drink offering for the priests to offer to God in His temple vv.
[55]  Third, Joel speaks concerning the outpouring of the processed, consummated, compound Spirit, the Spirit of God compounded with Christ s humanity, Christ s death and its effectiveness, and Christ s resurrection with its power.
[56]  Joel is a short book of three chapters, but it covers human history from 606 B.C. to the millennium.
[57]  A major revelation in Joel is that God has raised up four empires symbolized by four kinds of locusts, beginning with Babylon and continuing with Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire, to devastate the one small nation of Israel, God s elect.
[58]  Along the way, while such a history was proceeding, God poured out Himself as the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended One, the processed and consummated Triune God as the Spirit, upon the believers of Christ.
[59]  In this portion we have the turn of Jehovah to His elect, Israel 2:12-32 , the judgment of Christ upon the nations 3:1-15 , and the victory of Christ with His overcomers over the nations and His reign among Israel in the age of restoration 3:9-13, 16-21 .
[60]  In returning to their God, Jehovah s elect should rend their hearts and not their garments v. 13 . They should do this so that God would turn, repent, and leave a blessing behind Him a meal offering and a drink offering v. 14 .
[61]  In verses 18 through 27 we see that God desires to bless His own land.
[62]  The holy land, a particular area of land, is God s land.
[63]  Joel 3:1-15 speaks concerning the judgment of Christ upon the nations the judgment upon the living Acts 10:42; 17:31 .
[64]  The purpose of Christ s judgment upon the living will be to recompense the nations mistreatment of Israel during the great tribulation vv.
[65]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE THIRTEEN ON JOEL 4 THE CONTROLLING PROPHECY
[66]  OF THE FOUR LOCUSTS IN THE BOOK OF JOEL Scripture Reading: Joel 1:4; 2:28-32; 3:9-21
[67]  In this message I have the burden to give a further word on the prophecy concerning the four kinds of locusts in the book of Joel
[68]  In the interpretation of the prophecies of the Bible, Joel s prophecy is more controlling than Daniel s. It is true to say that Daniel s prophecy is the controlling factor for us to understand and interpret the prophecies in the Bible.
[69]  Today three things are taking place on earth: the consuming by the Roman locusts, the suffering of Israel, and the manifestation of Christ.
[70]  Little of Christ is manifested in the Roman Catholic Church and in the denominations, but Christ is manifested in His recovery.
[71]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE FOURTEEN ON JOEL 5 THE FOUR FACTORS IN THE BOOK OF JOEL Scripture Reading: Joel 1:4; 2:28-32; 3:16-21
[72]  In this message I would like to give a further word on the four factors, the four main principles, in the book of Joel
[73]  As a result of God s entering into humanity and His mingling with humanity, there is now a unique person Jesus who is both the complete God and a perfect man.
[74]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE FIFTEEN ON JOEL 6 THE UNIVERSAL HISTORY
[75]  THE DIVINE HISTORY WITHIN THE HUMAN HISTORY Scripture Reading: Joel 1:4; 2:28-29; 3:11-21
[76]  It was according to God s economy that the four kinds of locusts were raised up to consume Israel for so many years in order that He could fulfill His economy by being incarnated into humanity through Israel.
[77]  All of this was through these two factors the consuming locusts and the suffering Israel that God could fulfill His economy to have an expression, the organic Body of Christ.
[78]  One day the very God who created the universe became incarnated, being conceived of the Holy Spirit within the womb of a human virgin and then born of this virgin to be the God-man, the One who is the complete God and a perfect man.
[79]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE SIXTEEN ON JOEL 7 THE HISTORY OF GOD WITH MAN
[80]  The Bible has much to say about God, Christ, Israel, and many other things, but what does the Bible actually talk about?
[81]  In our study of the Minor Prophets, we have emphasized four points: God s chastisement of Israel, God s punishment upon the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration of all things.
[82]  Through God s chastisement of Israel and His punishment upon the nations, the manifestation of Christ is brought forth, and the manifestation of Christ will bring in the restoration.
[83]  The history of God with man and of God in man is not a simple matter.
[84]  Thus, there are two lines God s line and man s line.
[85]  Because man, including Israel, has taken his own way and has become sinful and corrupt, God comes in to chastise Israel, His chosen people, and to punish the nations.
[86]  God s chastisement of Israel and His punishment of the nations affords a way for Christ to be manifested.
[87]  The book of Amos, as one of the Minor Prophets, also covers the chastisement of Israel and the punishment upon the nations to bring in the manifestation of Christ, issuing in the restoration, which consummates in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.
[88]  In this message we will cover three matters: the introductory word, Jehovah s judgments on the surrounding nations, and His judgments on Judah and Israel.
[89]  The book of Amos has five sections: the introductory word 1:1-2 ; Jehovah s judgments on the surrounding nations 1:3 2:3 ; Jehovah s judgments on Judah and Israel 2:4-16 ; Jehovah s contending with the house of Jacob 3:1 9:10 , including Jehovah s three reproofs to Israel 3:1 5:27 and the plagues of the five signs seen by Amos 6:1 9:10 ; and the restoration of the house of Israel, with the rebuilding of the fallen tabernacle of David for the kingdom of Christ 9:11-15 .
[90]  Jehovah s judgment on Israel was due to their having sold the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals v. 6 , panting after the dust of the earth upon the heads of the poor v. 7a , and turning aside the way of the meek v. 7b . Israel also transgressed in that a man and his father went in unto the same woman, in order to profane Jehovah s holy name v. 7c . Upon garments taken as pledge, Israel lay themselves down beside every altar v. 8a . The poor were so destitute when borrowing money that they would give their bedding as a pledge.
[91]  In this message we will begin to consider Jehovah s contending with the house of Jacob.
[92]  The content of 3:1 5:27 is Jehovah s three reproofs to Israel.
[93]  In chapter five we have Jehovah s third reproof to Israel, the strongest of the three reproofs.
[94]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE NINETEEN ON AMOS 3 JEHOVAH S CONTENDING WITH THE HOUSE OF JACOB 2 AND
[95]  In 6:1 9:10 we have the plagues of the five signs seen by Amos, and in 9:11-15, a word concerning the restoration of the house of Israel with the rebuilding of the fallen tabernacle of David for the kingdom of Christ.
[96]  Fire to Devour the Great Deep and the Land
[97]  The Lord told Amos that He was now setting a plumb line in the midst of His people Israel v. 8a . He said, The high places of Isaac will be desolated, / And the sanctuaries of Israel will be made waste; / And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword v. 9 . The high places were the places where Israel worshipped the idols on the mountains.
[98]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE TWENTY ON OBADIAH JEHOVAH S DEALING WITH ESAU
[99]  Edom did evil also by standing on the side when strangers took his brother s substance captive and foreigners entered into his brother s gates and cast lots over Jerusalem, and he was like one of them v. 11 . He was happy to see that Jacob was suffering.
[100]  The house of Jacob will be a fire, / And the house of Joseph a flame; / And the house of Esau will be as stubble, / And they will burn among them and devour them; / And there will be no survivor / To the house of Esau, / For Jehovah has spoken v. 18 . This tells us that, as the issue of God s dealing, the house of Jacob will overcome Edom.
[101]  This judgment will issue in Israel s gaining the victory and enlarging their territory for the kingdom of God on earth, especially for God s kingdom in the time of restoration.
[102]  TO THE MOST EVIL CITY OF THE GENTILES Scripture Reading: Jonah 1 4
[103]  JONAH S FLEEING FROM JEHOVAH S COMMISSION A. Jehovah s Commission
[104]  Jehovah s commission was for Jonah to go and cry out against the evil of Nineveh 1:2 .
[105]  God intended to judge Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, but He also intended to extend His salvation of love to that evil Gentile city.
[106]  As we have pointed out, Jonah here was a type of Christ, who was sent by God to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, with Jonah s staying in the great fish three days and three nights typifying Christ s staying in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
[107]  Chapter four of this book exposes Jonah s prejudice.
[108]  Therefore I anticipated it by fleeing to Tarshish, for I know that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and great in lovingkindness and repentant of evil v. 2 . Jonah could not tolerate the fact that, after charging him to preach that the city of Nineveh would be overthrown, God changed His mind.
[109]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO ON MICAH 1 THE INTRODUCTORY WORD
[110]  The Minor Prophets reveal that God uses the Gentiles as a means, an instrument, to chastise His elect, Israel.
[111]  God s chastisement of Israel and His punishment of the Gentiles issue in the manifestation of Christ, and the manifestation of Christ brings in the restoration, which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth.
[112]  Christ is revealed in His eternal origin 5:2c ; in His human birth in Bethlehem 5:2a ; in His being the Ruler, the Shepherd, and the peace of Israel in the millennium Rev 20:4, 6; Micah 5:2b, 4a, 5a ; in His becoming great 5:4b ; and in His saving Israel from Assyria 5:6b .
[113]  The book of Micah has five sections: the introductory word 1:1 ; Jehovah s reproof on Israel 1:2 2:11; 3:1-12 ; Jehovah s comfort to Israel 2:12-13; 4:1 5:15 ; Jehovah s contention with Israel 6:1-16 ; and the prophet s observation and expectation 7:1-20 .
[114]  Let us now consider Jehovah s reproof on Israel.
[115]  We have emphasized the fact that all the minor prophets speak the same thing in different ways, from different angles, and in different aspects.
[116]  In the foregoing message we covered the introductory word and Jehovah s reproof on Israel.
[117]  Micah 1 reveals that Jehovah is coming forth out of His temple to exercise His judgment upon sinful Israel.
[118]  When Assyria comes into our land / And when he treads in our palaces, / We will raise up against him seven shepherds / And eight princes of men.
[119]  IN THEIR SPEAKING CONCERNING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Micah 5:2-9; Amos 9:11-15
[120]  In this message I would like to give a word on the greatness of the prophets in their speaking concerning Christ.
[121]  However, when they turned from Christ to their own observations regarding the condition and situation of God s people, they became small.
[122]  Then he goes on to say that this One, who is Israel s Ruler and Shepherd, will be the peace when Assyria comes into the land v. 5 . In verse 6 the prophet first speaks of the land of Assyria and the land of Nimrod, and then, prophesying about Christ, declares, He will save us from Assyria.
[123]  Furthermore, this revelation opens up God s eternal economy, for the four stages of the locusts occupy a great part of God s economy in relation to mankind.
[124]  Both books deal with the city of Nineveh, but whereas Jonah brought, or extended, God s salvation to that sinful city, Nahum brought God s judgment upon Nineveh.
[125]  In Hebrew Nahum means comfort and avenge, signifying that Jehovah God comforts His elect, Israel, and avenges Israel of her enemy, Nineveh.
[126]  The remainder of the book of Nahum 1:8 3:19 speaks of Jehovah s judgment on Nineveh.
[127]  First, the Judge pronounces His verdict concerning Nineveh s destruction by the Medes and Babylonians in 612 B.C. 1:8-12a, 14 . Verse 8 says that when the time comes, God would use an overflowing flood to make a full end of her place.
[128]  This verse is related to God s eternal salvation, to His salvation of our whole being spirit, soul, and body.
[129]  For us to receive God s eternal salvation, we need to be embraced by God, and we need to cling to Him.
[130]  The central thought of Habakkuk is this: the righteous God will judge both the evil Israel and the violent Chaldeans, and only the righteous one shall live by his faith 2:4b , that all the earth may know the glory of Jehovah 2:14 and be silent before Jehovah, who is in His holy temple 2:20 , and that His seeker may sing to Him in prayer, in lauding, and in trusting in Him ch.
[131]  The revelation in Habakkuk concerning God s eternal salvation to sinners was brought out by a conversation between the prophet and God.
[132]  In the first dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah, the prophet inquired of Jehovah concerning the iniquity, distress, destruction, and contention that he saw v. 2-4 . Regarding violence, he said, How long, O Jehovah, shall I cry / And You do not hear? / I cry out to You, Violence! / And You do not save v. 2 . According to the prophet s view, violence was prevailing.
[133]  The unique way for sinners to obtain God s eternal salvation is to believe in God s embodiment, Christ, that they may become righteous and be justified to have life and live.
[134]  The Bible is the divine revelation through God s speaking.
[135]  Regarding this, we need to realize that it is not easy for God to speak to human beings directly.
[136]  His being incarnated was the first step of all His goings forth, and God was anticipating this.
[137]  In lauding, the prophet praised God in His majesty and splendor vv.
[138]  3-4 , in His terrifying judgment on the nations vv.
[139]  5-12 , and in His salvation of His people and of His anointed one vv.
[140]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE THIRTY ON ZEPHANIAH JEHOVAH S JUDGMENT AND SALVATION Scripture Reading: Zeph 1 3
[141]  In this message we will consider the book of Zephaniah.
[142]  The revelation in this book is very simple and concerns two matters Jehovah s judgment and His salvation.
[143]  The central thought of Zephaniah is that Jehovah is the judging and saving God both to Israel and to the nations, issuing in His reigning among Israel 3:15b and in Israel s singing and rejoicing in their restoration 3:14 .
[144]  In His judgment on Israel, Jehovah will cut off man, beast, birds, fish, stumbling blocks, the wicked, the remnant of Baal, the idol worshippers, the idol priests with the priests, the worshippers of the host of heaven, the worshippers of Malcam, and those who have been turned back from going after Jehovah 1:2-6 .
[145]  In His judgment on Israel, Jehovah would also prepare Jerusalem with its princes, the sons of the king, all who wore the clothing of foreigners, and all those who did violence and deceit, as His sacrifice, and He would call the Chaldeans, whom He had sanctified, to come and eat His sacrifice by plundering the wealth of Jerusalem and desolating the houses and vineyards in Jerusalem vv.
[146]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE ON HAGGAI THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE OF JEHOVAH
[147]  In this message we will cover the book of Haggai, a book that is concerned with the building of the house of Jehovah in relation to Israel s welfare and Messiah s coming.
[148]  Jehovah pointed out that the returned captives had sown much but had brought in little; that they had eaten and drunk but without satisfaction; that they had clothed themselves but without being warmed; and that they had earned wages to put them into a bag with holes v. 6 . This tells us that if we do not have the heart to take care of God s house for His satisfaction, no matter how much we eat or drink or how well we dress ourselves, there will be no satisfaction.
[149]  Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest and all the remnant of the people responded to Jehovah by listening to the voice of Jehovah their God and to the words of Haggai the prophet, and they were in fear before Jehovah v. 12 . Then Haggai, Jehovah s messenger, encouraged the people with Jehovah s declaration, I am with you v. 13 . Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the spirit of Joshua, and the spirit of all the people, and they came and did work in the house of Jehovah of hosts vv.
[150]  The name Malachi in Hebrew means My messenger, signifying that Malachi was a messenger of God to minister the word of Jehovah to His people Israel.
[151]  The central thought of the prophecy of Malachi is the correcting of the priests among Israel for the coming of Christ as the Messenger of God and the advising of the people of Israel for the appearing of Christ as the Sun of righteousness.
[152]  In 1:6 3:4 we have Jehovah s dealing with the sons of Levi, that is, His dealing with the priests.
[153]  In verse 15 Malachi goes on to say that in marriage God has made the husband and wife one in order to produce the seed of God, that is, godly children.
[154]  AS REVEALED IN MALACHI Scripture Reading: Mal 3:1-3; 4:1-3
[155]  This is fully proved by the four Gospels, which are a complete and perfect record of Christ as the living message sent by God to His chosen people.
[156]  Just as a child shares the life and nature of his father but not the fatherhood, so we as sons born of God share God s life and nature but not His fatherhood nor His Godhead.
[157]  WITH THE SONS OF JACOB Scripture Reading: Mal 3:5 4:6
[158]  In verses 13 through 18 we see Jehovah s encouragement to those who fear Him and serve Him.
[159]  They said, It is vain to serve God, and they asked, What profit is it that we have kept His charge and have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts? v. 14 . They worshipped and served God, but they did it mournfully, not at all happy that they were required to do these things.
[160]  Those who spoke strongly against Jehovah also said, Now we call the arrogant blessed; not only have those who act wickedly been built up, but they also try God and escape v. 15 . This indicates that these opposers of God seemed to be saying, The way to be blessed is not to be humble but to be arrogant.
[161]  LIFE-STUDY OF THE MINOR PROPHETS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE THE REVIVAL REVEALED IN THE MINOR PROPHETS Scripture Reading: Hab 3:2a; Hosea 6:2; Joel 2:28-29; Hag 1:14; Mal 3:1b; Hag 2:7a; Heb 7:22; Acts 26:18b; Col 1:12; Mal 4:2a; Rom 8:20-22
[162]  In this concluding message to the life-study of the Minor Prophets, I have the burden to speak a word concerning the revival revealed in the Minor Prophets.
[163]  Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people Hag 1:14a .
[164]  Here we see the response of God s elect, who were stirred up by the Lord in the order of God s authority.
[165]  In the Minor Prophets there are both the divine Spirit, the consummated Spirit of God, and the human spirit, the stirred-up spirit of God s elect.
[166]  At this juncture, I would like to give an additional word on the matter of revival.
[167]  Concerning this, Romans 8:20-22 says, The creation was made subject to vanity, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
