<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXV. APPLYING THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST<br>TO THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit applies the resurrection of Christ to the believers (Rom. 8:11). In order to enjoy the application of the resurrection of Christ by the Spirit, you need to be revived every morning. If you practice this every day, I must tell you that ten or twenty minutes actually are not adequate. You need a longer time. You may say that since you are working, you cannot spare that much time. On the one hand, I agree with you, but on the other hand, you should still try your best to spend more time with the Lord in the morning. According to my experience, I need a longer time. If I spend a longer time in morning revival contacting the Lord in fellowship with Him for thirty minutes, forty-five minutes, or even an hour, I am more fully in the enjoyment of Christ's resurrection.</P><P>Being in resurrection brings us many benefits. In resurrection we have peace, joy, rest, strength, and everything positive. The Spirit is the totality of resurrection. Furthermore, the resurrection can be applied to us only by the life-giving Spirit, by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The reality of resurrection can be ours only through the applying Spirit. This is a great function of the all-inclusive Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVI. MINGLING WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS,<br>MAKING THE TWO ONE SPIRIT</H2><P>The all-inclusive Spirit of God mingles with the spirit of the believers, making the two one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us (1 Cor. 6:19) and is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVII. BEING THE ESSENCE OF THE DIVINE LIFE<br>BY WHICH THE BELIEVERS LIVE AND WALK</H2><P>The Spirit is the essence of the divine life by which the believers live and walk. The divine life, essentially speaking, is the Spirit. Galatians 5:16 and 25 both refer to our living and walking by the Spirit as the essence of the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXVIII. BRINGING FORTH THE FRUIT<br>OF THE VIRTUES OF THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The Spirit brings forth the fruit of the virtues of the believers (Gal. 5:22-23). We believers need virtues, but not according to our natural character and conduct. We need the fruit of Christian virtues borne by the Spirit. The Spirit moves and lives in us to bear fruit, the fruit of Christian virtues. These are not the natural virtues but the virtues of Christ expressed in our spiritual life.</P>
