Being Put Aside by God for Forty Years</H2><P>God purposely and sovereignly put Moses aside for forty years (Exo. 2:14-15; Acts 7:27-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Learning to Serve God according to<br>His Leading and to Trust in Him</H2><P>In those forty years Moses learned to serve God according to His leading and to trust in Him (Acts 7:34-36; Heb. 11:28). Moses eventually became a person who did nothing according to his will. He always acted according to the Lord's leading. The Lord led him, and he followed. He had no faith in his ability. Although he was very capable, he did not use his natural ability. His natural ability was dealt with, so it became an ability in resurrection. The ability in resurrection corresponds with God's move. If our ability is not dealt with, it is separate from God's move. But after being dealt with by the cross, our ability becomes one with God's move. Actually, God was wrought into Moses' ability. His ability eventually was full of God.</P><P>Exodus 2 shows us a natural Moses, a Moses with his natural strength and ability. That was purely, solely, wholly, and absolutely Moses without God. Then after chapter three we can see another kind of Moses, a Moses that was fully dealt with by God. After chapter three, God was in Moses and whatever Moses did in his acts and move was full of God, having the divine element.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE CASE OF PETER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being Self-confident<br>in His Natural Strength and Ability</H2><P>Peter was self-confident in his natural strength and ability even to the point of thinking that he would follow the Lord both to prison and to death (Luke 22:33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Put into a Test</H2><P>Peter was tested and he denied the Lord three times, even before a little maid (John 18:15-18, 25-27).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> </body></html>
