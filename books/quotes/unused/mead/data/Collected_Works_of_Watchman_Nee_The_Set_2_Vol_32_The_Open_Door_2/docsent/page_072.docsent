   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Sister Luh Tsi-tsien,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Szechuan Province</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the time I sent out my last letter from Fu-Shan, three months have passed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During these three months the Lord has given me evidence of His grace in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not refer to the result of my work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The success or failure of the work does not have much to do with me personally.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am referring to spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has shown me the evil and corruption of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flesh can only please men; it cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is the One who searches man's inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Outwardly, we may be completely separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But inwardly, we are still mixed up with it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There must at least be once when God deals with our self and the flesh in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we see the Lord being hung on the cross, we cannot refrain from speaking from our heart, "Lord, You have paid such a high price for me!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are worthy of everything from me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After I consecrated myself unconditionally to Him, God began to show me how my way is one of loneliness and dejection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My previous experiences were something outward, but now His real work has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We met with the sisters in Chungking for four days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although they initiated the meetings, God showed me my own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, this meeting was altogether for me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the past two weeks, under the Lord's leading, I came to preach the gospel in Jiang-Bei in Brother Wu Fuh-chu's home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His wife was recently saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will leave Chungking after the middle of January.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may go to Bei-Pei, or we may travel to the south.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the meeting hall at 9 Garden Road, there were gospel meetings every night from the second to the seventh of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was quite an enthusiastic attendance, and the seats were all filled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The main speaker was an American by the name of Brother X. Please do not forget to pray for me, Sister Ma, and all the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sister Luh Tsi-tsien, January 4</S>
