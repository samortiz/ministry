   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank the Lord that the first baptism meeting in Jiaxing received the blessing of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There were seventeen brothers and sisters who were baptized into the Lord's church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God had mercy on me, one who is lazy, weak, and fearful, and who has unprofitably occupied a place in Jiaxing for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, I marvel and grieve all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I can only praise God with all my strength in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On that day the whole church praised God with joy such as they had never experienced before!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We look to God to have mercy on us and to guide these newly baptized, fresh, and living brothers and sisters that they would go on in the way before them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are young and weak, and we are prone to ruin things.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The new brothers were not the only ones edified; I was edified first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although I have believed in the Lord for many years, I am inwardly weak, poor, and pitiful!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I lack basic training.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I could never find this kind of light if I spent my entire life studying by myself.</S>
