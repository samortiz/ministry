   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Cause Sin to Be Condemned</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second accomplishment of Christ's crucifixion is that sin in the flesh was condemned by God through Christ who was made sin on the cross for the believers 2 Cor 5:21; Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To take away sin is one thing, but to be made sin is another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, Christ took away sin, and, second, Christ was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, Christ came as the Lamb of God to take away the load of sin from fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this fallen man is still sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fallen man not only carries a load of sin, but the fallen man himself is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore Christ as the Lamb of God first took away the load of sin; but to deal with the fallen man himself Christ had to do a further work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This further work was for Christ to be made sin 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Fallen man is sin because fallen man is flesh Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in order to condemn sin Christ became flesh John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But when Christ became flesh, He came only in the likeness of the flesh of sin Rom 8:3 , just as the brass serpent was only in the form of the serpent John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ became flesh in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He Himself was not the flesh of sin, but He was in the likeness, the form, of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was in this likeness of the flesh of sin that He was made sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was not a serpent in nature, in poison, but only in form.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had no sin Heb 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 5:21 even says that He knew no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was only in the form of the sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While He was in the form, the likeness, of the sinful flesh, He was made sin and died in this flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By His dying in the flesh, sin was condemned by God Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that He terminated both sin and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin was condemned through Christ who was made sin on the cross for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To Destroy Satan</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third accomplishment of Christ's crucifixion was that He destroyed Satan, the old serpent, by being judged by God as the brass serpent Heb 2:14; John 3:14; Num 21:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Christ was crucified on the cross, God saw Him first as the Lamb, second, as the flesh which was sin, and, third, as a brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As the Lamb He took away sin, as the flesh He caused sin to be condemned by God, and as the brass serpent He destroyed the old serpent, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To Deal with the Old Man</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fourth accomplishment of Christ's crucifixion was that He dealt with the old man by being crucified as the last Adam Rom 6:6; 1 Cor 15:45a .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must realize that a fallen person is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fallen man is not only carrying a load of sin, but he himself also is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, within him there is the old serpent, Satan, and he also has the old man, the old self.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man has a problem with sin, the flesh, Satan, and the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the Lamb of God Christ took away the load of sin; through His being in the likeness of the flesh of sin, sin was condemned; as the brass serpent Christ destroyed the old serpent, Satan; and through Him as the last Adam, the old man was crucified.</S>
