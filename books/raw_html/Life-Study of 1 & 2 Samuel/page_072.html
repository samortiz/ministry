SAMUEL DYING</H2><P>In 25:1a we are told that Samuel died. All Israel mourned for him, and they buried him at his house in Ramah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. After the Proper and Full Enjoyment<br>of His Portion in the Good Land Promised by God</H2><P>Samuel died a peaceful death after the proper and full enjoyment of his portion in the good land promised by God. Samuel enjoyed the good land throughout his entire life. His enjoyment of the land exceeded that of everyone else in the Old Testament, including Joshua and Caleb, who spent much time fighting to gain possession of the land. From his youth in the tabernacle until the time of his death, Samuel enjoyed the good land in every way and in every sense.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. After Being a Priest, a Prophet, and a Judge</H2><P>Samuel became a priest, a prophet, and a judge to usher in the Davidic kingdom for the accomplishment of God's economy on the earth. He was the one who brought in the kingship, anointing both Saul and David, the first two kings. He therefore established the kingdom of God and wrote all the regulations concerning the kingdom of God.</P>
