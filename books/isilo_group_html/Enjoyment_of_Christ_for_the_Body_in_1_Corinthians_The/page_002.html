<h1 class="title">ENJOYING CHRIST PRACTICALLY<br />
AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br />
TO BE ONE SPIRIT WITH HIM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2, 9, 13a, 22-24, 30; 2:1-2, 7, 9-12, 14-15; 15:45b; 12:13, 3b; 6:17; 7:40b</h1>
<p>As the first of the New Testament Epistles, the book of Romans is a sketch of the Christian life and the church life. Romans is followed by 1 Corinthians, which reveals some truly wonderful items. If we consider the expositions of the New Testament throughout the centuries, we can realize that the depths, mysteries, and hidden things in 1 Corinthians have been discovered, or recovered, only in recent years. Knowing the hidden depths in 1 Corinthians can be compared to knowing the mystery of the universe and knowing the mystery within man. The universe is composed of the heavens, the earth, and many items. It is easy to see the physical things in the universe; however, it is not easy to realize what the depth, mystery, and kernel of the universe are. We may say that the mystery of the universe is Jesus, but to apply this and make it even more practical, it is better to say that the mystery of the universe is the divine Spirit.</p>
<p>Just as the mystery of the universe is the divine Spirit, the mystery within man is the human spirit. When we look at a person, we see his physical body, but the mystery within this physical body is the human spirit (Job 32:8a; Prov. 20:27; 1 Cor. 2:11a; 1 Thes. 5:23). Atheists say that there is no divine Spirit in the universe, and many people also say that there is no spirit within man. However, without the divine Spirit, the universe would be a lifeless thing, and without the human spirit, the body would be a corpse. The entire universe depends on the divine Spirit, and a human being depends on the human spirit. It is easy to see all the outward things without seeing that the divine Spirit is the mystery of the universe and that our human spirit is the mystery of our human being. In the same way, it is easy to see many items in 1 Corinthians without touching the depths and the mysteries within this book.</p>
<p>First Corinthians speaks of many matters, such as lawsuits among believers (6:1-11), marriage life (7:1-40), the Lord&rsquo;s table (10:14-22), head covering (11:2-16), and speaking in tongues (12:10, 28). Many Christians magnify chapter 12 because speaking in tongues is mentioned there. When a member of our body keeps its appropriate size, it remains normal and performs its function for the benefit of the body. However, if a member is enlarged out of proportion, it becomes abnormal, it places a heavy burden on the body, and it loses its function. God&rsquo;s design of our body can never be improved upon; thus, every part should remain in its proper size and proportion. Likewise, chapter 12 is only one of sixteen chapters in 1 Corinthians. Speaking in tongues is mentioned in chapter 12, but it must be kept in its proper proportion, as Paul points out in chapter 14. Strictly speaking, the subject of 1 Corinthians is neither marriage nor head covering nor tongue-speaking. It is easy to see the outward matters in 1 Corinthians, but it is difficult to find the depths, the mystery, in this book. This is the reason that from the time of the Reformation until the present century, this book was never opened up in its depths. Only in the last few years has this book been open to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH OF GOD<br />
BEING IN A LOCALITY PRACTICALLY</h2>
<p>Each book in the Bible begins in a specific way. Genesis, Exodus, Matthew, and John all begin differently, according to their specific purpose. Paul begins 1 Corinthians by addressing his Epistle to &ldquo;the church of God which is in Corinth&rdquo; (1:2a). This Epistle is written to the church of God in the locality of Corinth. Some people have condemned the teaching that the church is expressed in each locality. They say that the church is heavenly, and to bring it down to a locality makes it earthly. However, Paul begins this Epistle by addressing the church of God which is in Corinth. To say that the church is heavenly is to speak in a doctrinal way, but to speak of the church in a certain locality is to be practical. The church in a locality is the church in practicality. If there is no practical church in our locality, we should endeavor to gather a few saints together to become the church, but if we cannot do this, we may need to move to a locality where there is a local church. No one can live properly without a home and a family. If anyone does not have a family, he is a wanderer. In the same way, we, as Christians, cannot live without the church expressed in a practical way in our locality. It is too doctrinal to speak of the church in the heavens. We need to be practical.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLING ON THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST</h2>
<p>In verse 2 Paul also mentions &ldquo;all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In this verse Paul does not address his Epistle to those who merely study the Bible, pray in their homes, or speak in tongues. Rather, he addresses it to all those who call on the name of the Lord. Paul had a particular purpose in writing in this way. Genesis begins with, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (1:1), because this book goes on to speak of God&rsquo;s creation. Likewise, the Gospel of John opens with, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1), because John tells us that Christ is eternal. In the same way, the beginning of 1 Corinthians tells us that it is a book that deals with calling on the name of the Lord. Many people have read, studied, and researched 1 Corinthians, but their eyes were not open to see the matter of calling on the name of the Lord. In order to properly partake of this book, we must be in a church that is not in the heavens but in our locality, and we must also call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some may say that to call on the name of the Lord is a form or a regulation. To be sure, we need to drop many forms and regulations, but there are certain &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; that we must never drop, such as breathing, drinking, and eating. We can drop the form of sitting in pews, but we should never give up calling on the Lord. To drop our calling on the Lord is to drop our spiritual breathing, drinking, and eating. Others have said that people will not receive our practice of calling on the Lord, but many thousands have already received help by calling in this way. Calling on the Lord makes a great difference in our experience. Those who call on the name of the Lord are more living than those who remain silent. Some may also argue that calling on the Lord is not orderly. A certain short history of the Welsh revival of 1904 and 1905 records that many hundreds of people at that time shouted in their enjoyment of the Lord. According to this account, some people criticized this practice as being excessive. However, many people go to football games to shout. Is Jesus not more worthy of our shouting?</p>
<p>Some have argued that this kind of shouting is not found in the Bible, but we have found that to shout to the Lord is very scriptural. When the Lord entered Jerusalem for the last time, many of the people spread their own garments in the road and went before the Lord, rejoicing and praising God with a loud voice, saying, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!&rdquo; When the religious Pharisees, the chief priests, and the scribes saw these things, they were indignant and told the Lord, &ldquo;Rebuke Your disciples.&rdquo; Instead, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out&rdquo; (Matt. 21:8-9, 15; Luke 19:37-40). In our own homes we may simply sit or kneel and call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Whoever calls on the name of the Lord will see that it makes a difference in his experience. The Lord is rich to all who call upon Him (Rom. 10:12).</p>
<p>To call on the name of the Lord is not merely to pray. When we call, we are praying, but according to the meaning of the Greek word, to call is to shout, to cry loudly. There is nothing wrong with silent prayer, but there may be little enjoyment in it. When we change our prayer into calling, we have both prayer and enjoyment. Many times we may not need to pray in a common way; we may simply need to enjoy the Lord. If we are having a difficult time with our wife, for example, we should not pray that the Lord will change her. Rather, we simply need to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Our enjoying the Lord in this way will transform us.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:2 speaks of calling on the name of &ldquo;our Lord Jesus Christ...who is theirs and ours.&rdquo; Nowhere else in the New Testament can we find such an expression. We need to call on the Lord Jesus because He is our portion (Col. 1:12). He is Paul&rsquo;s portion, Peter&rsquo;s portion, and our portion for us to enjoy. First Corinthians 1:9 says, &ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; <em>Fellowship</em> here indicates participation. God has called us all into the enjoyment of and participation in Jesus Christ, who is our portion. Later in the chapter, verse 13 asks, &ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo; Jesus Christ is not divided. When we all enjoy Christ, we are one because the very Christ whom we enjoy is one. This oneness in the enjoyment of Christ our portion is the proper church life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Enjoyment of Christ for the Body in 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
