   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INWARD SHINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man's spirit is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the inward parts Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit of God is also God's lamp Rev 4:5 ; in fact, there is a sevenfold intensity to His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the meaning of the "seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man's spirit and God's Spirit are both lamps, together enlightening the inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are some people who live according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their only concern is the pleasure of the moment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They may drink, or dance, or take drugs with no consideration except their own gratification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such people are generally held in low esteem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others live according to their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are elated when things go well for them, but depressed when their circumstances are not favorable.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sometimes they are pleasant toward their associates, but other times they are critical or even hateful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may be in a genial mood, or they may be in a fit of rage.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These people are not well thought of by others either.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are others who also live according to their soul, but are highly regarded by those who know them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather than being changeable like the weather, they act rationally and think ahead as to what course of action they will take.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their behavior is controlled by their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These three kinds of people include almost everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are very few who live according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You were in one of these three categories until one day when you heard the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit of God touched your conscience, which is part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Your spirit was activated, leading you to repent and confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Your spirit is now a lamp indwelt by the Spirit of God, who is also a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The spirit wants to enlighten every part of your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By responding to the spirit's shining, you will be walking "according to spirit" Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes when God wants to shine in us, we will not open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why, after we have been praying for a while, we sometimes have nothing more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we use our spirit to pray, it functions as a shining lamp, searching all the parts of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It may shine on our thoughts, but we refuse to have the Lord probe there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may not say, "No, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Don't touch there!" but that is what we mean.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The spirit may shine on our emotions, especially the sisters', but we close up, sometimes even weeping, begging the Lord not to touch that area.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same thing may happen with our will, especially the brothers'; if we close our will, the spirit cannot fulfill its function of shining.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we close the doors to the Lord's shining, we no longer have any words to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we pray properly, using our spirit, there is a lamp shining.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we sense it shining on our thoughts, we can say, "Lord, I open my mind to You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Shine in me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Expose my thoughts."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In His light we confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When He shines on our emotions, we can open and confess what He reveals to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then He will shine on our will, and we can open this room also to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we open all these chambers one by one, the spirit will shine and we shall confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can keep praying for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we pray, the more we are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our inward parts will all be thoroughly searched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After such a time of prayer, we shall feel bright and transparent, filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is one aspect of the lamp, our spirit shining within.</S>
