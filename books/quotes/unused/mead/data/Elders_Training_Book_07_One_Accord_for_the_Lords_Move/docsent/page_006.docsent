   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE THREE SUBSTANCES OF THE POWER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 1:8; 4:31; 6:7; 12:24; 19:20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Acts begins with the one accord and stresses the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The early disciples could not have maintained or kept this one accord, however, if they had had different ways, means, agents, or substances for them to carry out the Lord s move on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we read through the entire book of Acts, we can see that the way they took to carry out God s move on this earth to fulfill His New Testament economy was entirely by three main substances prayer, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not only in Acts but also throughout the entire New Testament, prayer, the Spirit, and the Word were used for the carrying out of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The different groups in Christianity today use many other ways.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why I do not feel that it would be a profit to the move of the Lord in the recovery to establish schools or other things like this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This might be a distraction that keeps the churches somewhat different.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have different ways to do things, it is hard to keep the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to maintain the unique one accord we all have to learn to do the same thing by the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The substances which constitute the unique way for the Lord s move are prayer and the Spirit, which result in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE WORD GROWING AND MULTIPLYING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts never tells us that the Spirit grew and multiplied but that the Word grew and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are three sections in the book of Acts concerning the move of the Lord through His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter six is the end of the first section where it says the word of God grew v. 7 . Chapter twelve is the end of the second section and tells us that the word of God grew and multiplied v. 24 . Then Paul s ministry began in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Finally, chapter nineteen is the end of another section, telling us that the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong v. 20 . The Lord s move eventually is not to have something resulting in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we do actually is to carry the Word to people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Word is the real contents, the real constituents of the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God s Word constitutes the New Testament Bible and also constitutes the very New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should pray that we may have the Spirit as power to spread the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>GETTING CONSTITUTED WITH THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to pick up the Word to an even greater extent than Peter did.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter probably did not have a share, as we do, in the fourteen Epistles written by Paul and in the book of Revelation written by John.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why he charged the saints in his later ministry to take whatever the Apostle Paul wrote 2 Pet 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 16 the Lord told Peter and all his companions that He had many things to say to them which they could not have borne at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said that they had to wait for the Spirit of reality to come for further speaking vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Mostly, the Holy Spirit spoke in continuation of the Lord Jesus through Paul on the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word spoken by the Lord Himself directly to Peter is mostly in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After Pentecost, the Lord spoke to all His people mainly through the Apostle Paul in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter with all his companions had to pick up mainly what was recorded in the Gospels, but today we have to pick up much more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to pick up the words of the Lord from the four Gospels and especially from the fourteen Epistles of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After giving Life-study Messages on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, the first thing we published in collective volumes was our Life-studies on Paul s fourteen Epistles because we consider that his Epistles are more crucial for us to know God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For us to know the Lord Jesus in His earthly ministry we surely need the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To know His birth, His youth, His living and ministry on this earth, His death, resurrection, and ascension we have to pick up the record in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But for us to know the definition, the full revelation, of God s New Testament economy concerning the Body of Christ, we surely have to pick up the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The four Gospels show us the Head, while Paul s fourteen Epistles show us the Body and reveal the Head to us in an even deeper way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we are living in the Body today under the direction of Christ as our living Head, these fourteen Epistles are more crucial to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I charged the new full-timers in Taiwan to spend half a day, every day, in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a must.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even when they were out preaching the gospel to the villages, they still spent the first half of the day praying together in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They even brought their Life-studies with them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They always study the Word regularly according to their schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If these young ones do not have an adequate constitution of the Word, they will have nothing to present to others regardless of how much they pray.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the full-timers in Taiwan have something when they open up their mouth because they have been studying the New Testament in the Recovery Version with all the notes and the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are full of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are full of the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They have much to say, and this is quite convincing when they meet other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They open up the Recovery Version and give away some booklets and Life-studies; thus, many get attracted and would even like a copy of the Recovery Version for themselves.</S>
