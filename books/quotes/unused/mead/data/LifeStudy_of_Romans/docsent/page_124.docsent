   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR BEING FREED FROM SIN,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LAW, AND THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we saw that the central thought of the book of Romans is that God is transforming sinners into sons to form the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This not justification by faith is the basic concept of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not have this view, we shall have a very superficial understanding of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ultimately, this book is not merely for our personal salvation; it is for the formation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>FOUR STATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the book of Romans there are four stations: justification, sanctification, the Body, and the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All Christians may be classified according to these four stations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many real Christians have stopped at the station of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They have been redeemed, justified, reconciled, and saved, but they have stopped their journey at justification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems that they are satisfied and do not want to hear anything further.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past I have talked to many Christians about seeking the Lord and going on with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But some have said, Isn t it good enough to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have been saved, the blood of Jesus has redeemed me, I have been regenerated, and I am now a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day I shall go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please don t bother me with anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A great part of genuine Christians go no farther than this station.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the Lord s grace, other Christians seek for what is called the deeper life or the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are not satisfied merely with justification, but pursue something further, higher, richer, and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These Christians eventually reach the station of sanctification in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the end of World War II, some of the saints in the second station began to talk very much about the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the book of Romans, chapter twelve is the station of the proper Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But according to the experience of many Christians today, it is not actually the station of the Body, but the station of Body-talk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we may call these Christians the Body-talkers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I came to this country, I was surprised at all the talk about the Body ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later I learned that what was meant by Body ministry was several preaching one by one instead of only one preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although Christians talk so much about the Body, where is the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The more they talk about the Body, the more divisions they cause.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before 1945 there were not so many divisions in the United States as there are today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But from that time, hundreds of little groups began to form, nearly all of which were talking about the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not have the Body simply by talking about the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Body can be realized only in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you do not have the church life, how can you have the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, along with the third category of Christians, the Body-talkers, there is the fourth category: those who practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the fourth station in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where are you in relation to these four stations?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have the full assurance that I am in station four.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has been and still is working to transform sinners into sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These sons of God are the members forming the Body of Christ to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we have seen, God is in Christ, Christ is in His Body, and His Body is in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the basic concept and central thought of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not see this, we are short-sighted.</S>
