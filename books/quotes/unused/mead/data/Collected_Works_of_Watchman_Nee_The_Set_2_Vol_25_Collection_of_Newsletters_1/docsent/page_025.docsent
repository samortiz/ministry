   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In my opinion, there is a definite need for these three letters of recommendation today.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we do not have them, there will be many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people are still in the denominations even though they have been meeting and breaking bread with us for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They still are not able to leave the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is true that they are brothers, but we cannot say that they are clear about the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you see this brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There must be these three letters of recommendation before many difficulties can be resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Witness Lee asked: How do we know whether or not a letter of recommendation is genuine?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a brother from Chefoo went to P'ing Yang carrying a letter of recommendation, how would the brothers in P'ing Yang know that it was a genuine letter of recommendation?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can we know whether the letter was written by the locality the person came from?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brother Watchman Nee answered: I have personally considered this matter also.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to my personal opinion, we should know the condition of the meetings in each locality and the names of the responsible brothers in each place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, the number of forgeries can be greatly reduced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a person comes from Chefoo with a letter of recommendation signed by Brother Witness Lee, we do not have to worry at all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This matter can be resolved simply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If his letter is a forgery and he has written several names on it by himself, we should know once we have seen the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, all problems can be solved through fellowship, and the genuineness of a person can be proven through correspondence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, if a person comes from Fukien with a letter of recommendation asking us to receive him, we cannot refuse him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But after we receive him, we can write a letter to Fukien immediately, saying, "Thank the Lord, Brother So-and-so has arrived at our locality."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If his letter is false, the meeting in Fukien will most certainly write a letter to tell us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But according to my personal thought, this type of thing will not happen among us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not believe people will forge letters of recommendation for the purpose of coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These letters are not checks; they cannot receive any money for them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nor can they enjoy any special privileges with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, I think one case is probable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a brother among us has been excluded from the fellowship he would certainly be clear about all the matters among us , he might go to Nanking with a false letter of recommendation to meet with the brothers there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But I think this matter can be resolved easily.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After you receive a letter of recommendation, send a confirmation to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way we can be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Hu Chi T'ang answered: If you are afraid of forgeries, you can ask the locality sending the letter to write not only a letter for the brother, but also to write and send one to you directly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Chang Kuang Jung said: The letters of recommendation should be written by the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Watchman Nee said: The letters of recommendation are also written by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are written by the ones responsible for the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If any other brother writes the letter, then the brothers in the other localities will not know how many responsible brothers you have among you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will not know which brothers are responsible for your affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Chang Kuang Jung said: I think that the letters of recommendation should be written by the responsible brothers, and we should be able to recognize their handwriting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If it is that person's handwriting, we will know if it is genuine or false.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, the responsible brothers should not only sign the letters, but they should also affix their personal seal after their signatures; this is the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Watchman Nee said: You are right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have thought that if we lack fellowship among ourselves to the extent that we do not recognize the handwriting of the responsible brothers in each locality, we are very short.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When that happens, we do not need to wait for false brothers to come in among us; we already are not acting like genuine brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother Shih Chiu Jung asked: Does a brother need to carry a letter of recommendation every time he goes out?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Watchman Nee answered: I think we should carry letters of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot say that we do not need a letter of recommendation because we know the people in that locality well.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How will the people in that place know whether or not you recently have been excluded from the fellowship?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How will they know whether or not you have had some problems?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only way to know is by letters of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way, if we carry letters of introduction each time, we can avoid many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please remember that we should do everything to avoid problems for others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, Brother Lee has been among us for two or three months.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On Tuesday he will return to Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I should write a letter of recommendation for him to take back to Chefoo telling the brothers in Chefoo that he did not have any problems in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he were really excluded from the fellowship in Shanghai but we did not write a letter to tell the meeting in Chefoo, they would still receive him when he returned to Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way they would overturn his exclusion from fellowship, would they not?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, every time a brother or sister leaves us to return to his original locality, it is best that we write a letter of recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brother Witness Lee asked: If a brother goes out and plans to visit several meetings in one trip, how should we write that letter of recommendation?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Watchman Nee answered: If we go on a trip to visit several churches but we do not have a specific locality in which we plan to stay for a long while, we do not need to give our letter of recommendation to the brothers of any one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We only need to show it to them and then put it back into our own pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there is a brother who wants to visit every locality there are more than one hundred churches , the letter of recommendation should not be addressed to any one church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, he may arrive at a locality on the Lord's Day in time for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He should go in before the table.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But if he does not have time to fellowship with them, he can place his letter of recommendation on the table and sit down, and the matter should be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If they believe him, that would be the end of the story.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If they do not believe him, they can open the letter and read it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After the meeting, he can still take the letter back.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then he can go to the next locality on the following day.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way our letters of recommendation are something like a passport issued by the government.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This article is the record of a discussion we had after the Third Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Brother Nee's answers were agreed to by the co-workers from all the localities who came to the meeting.</S>
