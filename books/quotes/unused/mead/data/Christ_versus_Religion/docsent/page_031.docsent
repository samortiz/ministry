   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Jesus gives Peter a lesson</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In any case, by the Lord's talk with him, Peter was convinced and his mouth was shut.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do believe that Peter finally learned that he should never open his quick mouth and say yes or no, but let Jesus do the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The lesson is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must pay something for this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the Lord said to Peter, "Have you been convinced not to say yes or no?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then you go fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Go to the sea; there is no transportation, and I do not know how far you have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just go fishing, and cast a hook into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually you will catch a fish: open its mouth and find a coin which will be good not only for Me, but also for you, not only for the Head, but also for the Body."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I were Peter, I would be greatly distressed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I would say, "Lord, you want me to go fishing, all by myself?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Aren't you going to send John or James with me?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Lord would answer, "No, I will not send them with you, because you do not need them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if I sent them, you would never listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You always make the decisions yourself, so go fishing by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Learn the lesson that you need your brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Go to the sea, cast the hook into the water, and wait until the first fish comes."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peter went then to the sea and did as the Lord commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I simply cannot believe that he caught the fish immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do believe the Lord made him wait awhile for the first fish to come, giving him plenty of time to consider what had just transpired.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can imagine him there with a line in the water, waiting and waiting, considering and considering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the time the lesson was being driven into him deeper and deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter had a hard lesson to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is today's Elijah</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At last Peter caught the fish just as the Lord had said.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must now see that the Lord is not only today's Moses, but also today's Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is not only the One Who gives the laws, but also the One who prophesies, who predicts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He told Peter to go fishing, take the first fish and find in it a coin, this was a great prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The illustration was rather small, but the implication is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ today is both Moses and Elijah: He gives the laws and He prophesies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He predicts anything, it will certainly be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no more Moses and no more Elijah; there is only Jesus hear ye Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since we have Jesus, we need Moses no longer; since we have Jesus, we need Elijah no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the present Moses, and He is the present Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever He commands, that is the law; whatever He predicts, that is the prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, with whatever the Lord commands He also prophesies the way whereby we may fulfill what He has commanded.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is indeed marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Moses could only command; Moses could never afford anything in the way of supply for the people to fulfill his commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Lord is both the Commander and also the Fulfiller.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord not only gives us the commandments, but also affords us the supply to fulfill His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What we need to do is just to go along with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He says no, we must simply go along with Him and say no. When He says yes, we must go along with Him and say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He says, "Go fishing," then we must go fishing; when He says, "Cast the hook into the water," just cast it into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He says, "Wait until the fish comes," then just wait there until it comes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When He says, "Open the mouth of the fish," be simple, just open the mouth of the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When He says to take the coin from the fish's mouth, do it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Go along with His word, not merely with the word of the Bible, but the word of the living Jesus.</S>
