We know that it is good for us to be trained to have a proper character. In 1953 I taught thirty items of a proper character to a group of one hundred twenty trainees in Taipei, Taiwan (see the book entitled Character published by Living Stream Ministry). These thirty items of human character did not come from my imagination. They came up in my teaching from my own personal living and personal practice. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy I have learned that these items of a proper character are very crucial in our humanity. But in this message we want to focus our attention on a basic factor, that is, the matter of life. The life we are concerned with is the divine life mingled with our human life.<p>We are wonderful persons because we were created with the highest life in God&#8217;s creation. In God&#8217;s creation there are the plant life, the animal life, and the human life. In Genesis 1 you can see these three different levels of life. The human life is the highest among the created lives, yet it is not the top life in the universe. The top life in the universe is the divine life. Chapter two of Genesis shows the life which is signified by the tree of life. That life is a great mystery, yet we know that it is the life of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus&#8217; life is the life of the Triune God, the divine life. Thus, we can see that in the universe there are three lives in God&#8217;s creation, and there is one life which is the uncreated life, the divine life.<p>The Bible shows that the plant life is for the animal life; both of these lives are for the human life, and the human life is for the divine life. Many animals live on plants, which indicates that the plant life is for the animal life. At the beginning God also intended to have just the plant life for the human life. But the human life became fallen. Since the fall, God added something to support the human life, that is, the animal life. Thus, after the fall, both the plant life and the animal life are for the human life. This is why man eats meat in addition to vegetables and fruit, the things of the plant life. Day by day we are nourished and supplied with the plant life plus the animal life.<p>The plant and animal lives are for the human life, and our human life is for the divine life. Not only is the human life for the divine life but also the divine life is for the human life. The human life is only for God. That means it is for the divine life. Also, the divine life is mainly for man. That means it is for the human life. Thus, we see that in the whole universe there are four kinds of lives. We do not count the angelic life, because it is a subsidiary life. We Christians have the human life mingled with the divine life. These two lives are for one another. When we use the simple word life, we are referring to this mingled life. Life denotes the human life for the divine life and the divine life for the human life.<p>Now we need to see that in the Greek language of the New Testament, there are three words for life. The word for the physical life of our being is bios, from which the word biology comes. Psuche, from which the word psychology comes, is used to denote our soulish life, our psychological life. Zoe  denotes our spiritual life. Our being is constituted with three parts: body, soul, and spirit. In each of these parts there is a definite life: the life in our body is bios; the life in our soul is psuche; and the life in our regenerated spirit is zoe. One is our physical life; the second, in the middle, is the psychological life; and the last one, which is the deepest one in our being, is the spiritual life because it is in our spirit. We are wonderful persons of three parts with three lives. God&#8217;s intention is for Himself, the divine life, to be mingled with such a wonderful human life.<p>Our spiritual life, the divine life, zoe, should grow. It does not need to grow in God, but it does need to grow in us. Colossians 2:19 says that we need to grow with the growth of God. The divine life in God Himself is perfect, complete. It is at the highest peak and does not need any growth in itself. But when this life is mingled with our life, this mingled life needs to grow.<p>In the Scripture reading at the beginning of this message are some of the best verses concerning the growth in the divine life. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:6 that he planted and Apollos watered but God caused the growth. We need to consider what Paul planted. Surely he did not plant the plant life or the animal life. Even he did not plant the human life. He planted the divine life into the human life. According to Matthew 13, the human life is the soil in which the Lord sows Himself as the seed of life. When any seed of the plant life is sown into the earth, there will be a mingling. The seed mingles with the soil to produce a plant. So when Paul said he planted, this means that he planted the divine life into the believers. Once the seed has been planted, there is the need of watering. Watering helps the growth of this life, which is divine, in humanity.<p>Ephesians 4:15 tells us that we all need to grow into the Head. The Head is Christ, the One who has the divine life mingled with His human life. The Head of the church is not merely the divine person. The divine person alone is not qualified to be the Head of the Body, which is the church. This Head needs to be the divine life mingled with the human life. We believers are humans who have received the divine life. We have the human life mingled with the divine life, so we are qualified to be the members of the Body of this Head. Now the divine life in us needs to grow. The human life in the Lord Jesus grew. Luke 2 tells us clearly that Jesus grew not in the divine life but in the human life (v. 52). Today we are growing spiritually, not in the human life but in the divine life. He was growing in the human life, and now we are growing in the divine life. In this divine life we grow into the Head.<p>Just by your human life, you are not qualified to have an organic union with the Head. The organic union with the Head depends upon the divine life mingled with your human life by faith and baptism (Eph. 4:5). By believing and being baptized, we all have been put into this organic union. In this organic union we, who have the human life, received the divine life. The mingling began here. In this mingling we need to grow with the divine life into the Head, and this divine life is God Himself. Colossians 2:19 says that we grow with the growth of God. This means that we grow with the growth of the divine life. Thus, we are growing with God as the divine life into the Head.<p>Among today&#8217;s Christians there is very little talk about such growth. Sometimes they might use the word growth, but not according to its biblical denotation. According to the biblical denotation, our growth in the divine life is to grow with God Himself increasing in us. God increasing in us means that He is added into our being. In this way we grow up into the Head in all things.<p>We need to see that even this growth needs regulation. In 1963 I was invited to speak in Dallas, and I strongly told the people there that we do not need any teaching. After the meeting, a group of people challenged me. They pointed out some verses from the Bible to show that we need teaching. They did not understand what I meant. The divine life does not need any teaching, but our human life, in which the divine life is, needs some teaching. Then you may wonder why I told people that we do not need any teaching. My point is this: Christianity always teaches people in the human life, while neglecting the divine life. But what we are short of today is the divine life. Teaching cannot help you without the divine life. So what you need today, in this sense, is not the teaching but the divine life. When I came to this country, I did not minister teaching to people for the human life. What I ministered all the time was Christ Himself. Christians today are short of the divine life, which is embodied in Christ. So in this sense, you do not need teaching. You need Christ, the very embodiment of the divine life.<p>But in another sense, after you have the divine life, you need teaching. In this message I substitute the word teaching with its synonym regulation. Regulation actually is the top teaching. Every teaching regulates you. Every teaching which a mother gives to her children is a kind of regulation. In this sense the Bible is full of teaching, full of regulation. The Old Testament, the testament of the law, is full of commandments, and the New Testament is also full of commandments. Even the Lord Jesus said in the Gospel of John that He gave the disciples a new commandment (13:34). John stresses the divine life and also stresses teaching. That means John stresses regulation.<p>The full-time training is the top and strictest teaching. It is a regulation. We Christians who want to serve the Lord need this kind of teaching, this kind of training, this kind of regulation. In the training, you are restricted. It is as if you are put into a box. Of course, this box is not a coffin. I once went to visit a certain locality, and the brothers there put me into an apartment with a small shower. When I was taking a shower, it was very difficult for me to move around freely. I had been used to taking a shower in a larger area, without hitting any of the four walls. But that small shower regulated me. It was a small box that restricted me. I could not be so free or loose with my actions. This is an example of being restricted and regulated from being too free, too loose. Such restriction and regulation helps you to grow.<p>Now you have dedicated yourself to being full-time. You are not going to do a business or a job; you are going to carry out a heavenly commission, a divine commission, the commission of the King. The royal family in Great Britain has to train a king or a queen from the time of his or her youth. Without such training, one could never be a king. He would not be qualified to be a king. You do not need any training to be a hippie or a loose person. But to be a king, you need the top training, and the top training is the strictest regulation to help you grow.<p>We Christians must be regulated. When I was teaching the thirty items of human character, some so-called spiritual people told me that I was teaching something which contradicted my ministry. They said that I always ministered life to people but that now I was teaching people about human character, which was building up human effort. But they did not understand the proper experience of the growth in life. The growth in life, our human being&#8216;s growth in the divine life, needs regulation. Every regulation results in a certain character trait.<p>The first trait of a proper character according to my learning is genuineness. You must be genuine, real, true. Our human life is neither real nor true. It is false and vain. By our natural life we are vain, empty, and untrue. How can we be genuine? How can we be true? How can we be real? By the growth of the divine life. The more we grow in the divine life, the more we become genuine. Only the growth of the divine life in you will swallow up all of your falsehood and vanity to make you so real, genuine, and true. Another trait of a proper character is to be exact. How can we be exact? We need to grow in the divine life, and this growth needs the regulation.<p>Let me illustrate in this way. If four brothers would always be with you, you would be regulated on four sides every day. In the full-time training, you are surrounded by people and you have assigned roommates. Deep within your being, however, you would like to stay in a room by yourself. You do not like anyone to stay and sleep in one room with you. You might say, &#8220;I even don&#8217;t like a room just for two. I want a room for me alone.&#8221; All that you care about is &#8220;me&#8221;-me the first; me the second; me the third; me the last; me forever. You like to be free. To be free means not to be regulated. You may not like to be regulated by anybody. But when you are not regulated, you are through with the growth.<p>To put you in the training is to put you in an environment for your growth. The training is the best environment for you to grow. I encourage all of you to remain here for a full term of four months. Do not quit. Do not ask for a leave. Stay to the end. To the end means to the termination. You have to be here to be terminated. Then you will go back with a lot of growth. Sisters, you will greatly surprise your mother when you go back. She will be shocked at your growth. This is not according to some philosophical thinking. This is fully revealed in the Bible. Life grows by regulation.<p>Everybody likes marriage. But to some extent, eventually everybody hates marriage. Whether you like marriage or you hate marriage, it is God&#8217;s ordination. Marriage is merely, purely, and thoroughly a matter of regulation. To get married is to get into regulation. No one can regulate a brother as much as his wife can, and no one can regulate a sister as much as her husband can. Many people in the world cannot suffer this kind of regulation, so they quit. They either separate from each other or they get a divorce. They would not take the yoke ordained by God. Each dear wife and husband is a lovely yoke. Every day the husband is a yoke to his wife, and the wife is a yoke to her husband. This is ordained by God. A family is also a great factor of troubles. All these troubles come to regulate you. If you submit yourself to this regulation, this will help you to grow. The regulation of the family helps you to grow in the divine life.<p>The divine life does not grow in an easy environment. It grows only in a hard, troublesome, difficult environment. The full-time training is a troublesome factor. All the lessons assigned to you and all the teachers will be troublesome. In the first few days you may love the lessons and the teachers. But after a while you may begin to hate the training with all the classes, regulations, lessons, and teachers. This is a clear word to let you know that the full-time training is not a utopia. The training will be like the small shower to which I referred. The whole training will be a narrow shower to narrow you down. This will help you to grow.<h2 class=head1>THE GOAL OF OUR GROWTH BY REGULATION</h2><p>This growth by regulation has a goal, and this goal is maturity and function. We do not desire to train you with biblical knowledge according to the letter as they do in a seminary. We are cooperating with our God that He may give you more growth, that He may give you the maturity you need. Then you will be useful, and that usefulness is your function. The usefulness is function, and the function issues from maturity. The little babes cannot function in a useful way because they are short of the maturity in life. As a little child grows, his function increases. You cannot charge an elementary child to study college lessons. This little child has to grow to the full age. Then he will be able to study the college lessons. The function always comes out of maturity.<p>Since you desire to be very useful in the Lord&#8217;s hands, you need to realize that you need the maturity. This maturity comes out of growth. Without growth, even if you have the divine life, there is no maturity. The life plus the growth gives you the maturity. This growth always comes from the coordination of regulation with life. The divine life is precious, the regulation is lovely, and the growth is so valuable because it issues in maturity which gives you the function. Then you can fulfill your aim and goal of being a full-timer. This goal is to carry out God&#8217;s divine and heavenly commission.<p>I always consider that I am not doing a work. I am carrying out a commission with which I was charged by God years ago. What I am doing here is carrying out a commission, and this needs the proper function. Merely to learn the Bible in the way of studying four years in a seminary is altogether inadequate. You need to submit yourself to the regulation so that you may grow in the divine life. This growth in life brings you to maturity, and this maturity will afford you the function. It is by this function in maturity that you can fulfill your commission. Dear saints, this is my burden as an opening word for the full-time training. Do not take this training lightly. You must be serious with much prayer.<p>In the Scripture reading, I listed some verses in Matthew 25 concerning the virgins and concerning the slaves (vv. 1-4, 24-27). On the one hand, we are virgins and on the other hand, we are slaves. As virgins, we need the growth to reach maturity. Of course, the words growth and maturity are not mentioned in Matthew 25 but these two items are there.<p>This portion of the Word says that the wise virgins have oil both in their lamps and in their vessels (v. 4). The lamp signifies our spirit (Prov. 20:27), and the vessel signifies our soul, our being (Rom. 9:21, 23). Both in our spirit and in our entire being, we should be full of the oil, which signifies the Holy Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9). This is not the outpoured Spirit but the infilling Spirit. This Spirit fills our spirit and our entire being. To fill our spirit is to light the lamp, and to fill our being is to fill the entire vessel with the spiritual oil. The infilling of the spiritual oil actually is the growth reaching maturity. The more you grow, the more you will be filled within with the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God is the divine life, and the infilling of this Spirit of God is the growth of this divine life.<p>This is why we all must have a time with the Lord every day to make a thorough confession. In our prayer to fellowship with the Lord we must make a thorough confession of all our sins, transgressions, failures, defects, mistakes, wrongdoings, etc. The more we confess, the more we are filled in our entire being to have the growth of life unto the maturity in life. Every day in the training, we have to get our vessel filled with the Spirit. If a vessel is to be filled with precious things, it has to be empty. If that vessel is full of junk and dirt, nothing precious can get into it. Your confession of all your shortcomings and sinfulness is to empty all the dirt out of your being, your vessel. This is carried out not by yourself but by fellowshipping with the Lord. When you fellowship with Him, He will touch you and enlighten you. He will show you where you are and what your shortcomings are. Then you can follow His instructions and confess everything He shows you. This empties your vessel so that you can be filled with the Spirit. As long as the vessel is empty, the air gets in and the vessel becomes full of air, that is, full of the Spirit. We want to train you to build up this practice every day. Every day you need to get your being, your vessel, filled with the Spirit of God for your growth that you may reach maturity. Then you will have the function.<p>Matthew 25 also speaks of the slaves. What the slaves need is to function, and this function depends upon diligence. Diligence is another trait of a proper character. Your function needs maturity, but without diligence, you cannot function. Everyone who has reached maturity is a very diligent one. You need to fellowship with the Lord, pray to Him, receive His enlightenment, and be dealt with by Him. A slothful person would never contact the Lord regularly. In order to grow and reach maturity, you need to be diligent. The slave who would not invest his talent was evil and slothful. He would not use the talent given to him by the Lord. He hid his talent in the earth.<p>You must learn to be filled with the Spirit that you may grow in life to reach maturity. Then you need to exercise yourself to be diligent so that you can use the ability in maturity to serve the Lord to produce something for Him. Now you can see what the training wants you to do.<h1 class=series>AN OPENING WORD TO THE FULL-TIME TRAINEES CONCERNING REGULATIONS AND OPINIONS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>OLDNESS AND OPINIONS VERSUS REVELATION AND OBEDIENCE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Acts 10:9-16; 18:24-28; 19:1-5; 1 Cor. 16:12; Acts 15:36-41</h1><p>In the previous message, we saw that life grows by regulation toward maturity and function. We all have to realize that the proper regulation comes from revelation, and this kind of regulation that comes from revelation always brings us into the proper obedience. Regulation comes from revelation, and revelation brings us into obedience. Only one kind of obedience can be counted worthy in the eyes of God, and that is the obedience that comes out of revelation (cf. Acts 26:19).<p>Let us consider the case of Saul of Tarsus, who became the apostle Paul. He was a strong character. It was not so easy to bring him to the right track. The proper obedience is to get on the right track. When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he got on the right track, and that was his obedience. His obedience was not through man&#8217;s doing, teaching, exhortation, or advice but through the heavenly revelation. On the way to Damascus, he was met by the Lord, and he not only heard but also saw something (Acts 9:1-9). He later told us in Galatians that at that time a revelation came to him to reveal God&#8217;s Son into him (1:16). He did not just experience a kind of outward view, but something got into him as an inner revelation that knocked him down, that subdued him, that restricted him and got him on the right track.<p>In this message I want to talk with you about oldness and opinions versus revelation and obedience. Throughout my many years in the Lord&#8217;s service, in the Lord&#8217;s ministry, I have seen many cases of oldness and even more cases of opinion. In the church life among the saints, opinions are more prevalent than oldness. Oldness is terrible, but opinions are much more common among human beings. Every human being is a constitution of opinions. All of us were born sinful and have been constituted with opinions. Even though it has been a while since you have been regenerated, your constitution still is probably full of opinions.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE WITH ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA</h2><p>The book of Acts tells us that the early church passed through a number of troubles. The first trouble the church faced was the falsehood of a couple, Ananias and Sapphira (5:1-11). They lied to the Holy Spirit, to the church, and to Peter. They were judged for this sin.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE CAUSED BY LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES</h2><p>The second trouble was due to the matter of language. Some Jews who spoke Greek, the Hellenistic Jews, began to murmur (6:1). This trouble was caused by language differences.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE OF PETER&#8217;S OLDNESS</h2><p>The third trouble was with Peter due to his oldness. He was the top one used by the Lord at his time, and he was the leading one both in the church life and in the ministry. He was such a wonderful person. But when we read chapter ten of Acts, we realize that Peter was somewhat short, and his shortage was due to his oldness. He was holding on to his old understanding of God&#8217;s way because he was born, raised up, and taught as a Jew.<p>As Peter was praying, a trance came upon him and he saw a vision of a great sheet descending from heaven, full of unclean animals (vv. 9-12). A voice came to him, saying, &#8220;Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!&#8221; (v. 13). This was not a voice that came from Hades. It was a voice that came from the heavens. No doubt, Peter realized it was the voice of the Lord. But he still dared to tell the Lord something vice versa. He was so bold to talk to the Lord in a debating way. The Lord said, &#8220;Slay and eat&#8221; and he said, &#8220;By no means, Lord&#8221; (v. 14). Peter was a bold one, but he was not bold in the right thing. The Lord spoke this to him three times, but he did not let the Lord get through. He was stubborn in his oldness.<p>Without such a record in Acts 10, you could not imagine that Peter would be like this. He loved the Lord to the uttermost. We should not forget that when he was debating with the Lord, he was not doing anything sinful. He was on the housetop praying. As such a godly person who was so much in the spirit, he was exercising to contact the Lord. He was in such a good condition and atmosphere, yet there was the disobedience with him due to his oldness.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE CONCERNING CIRCUMCISION</h2><p>Another trouble arose later in the church because the Jews tried to bring in the practice of circumcision to the Gentile churches. This is clearly revealed and recorded in Acts 15. Even Paul and Barnabas stopped their ministry to go up to Jerusalem to get this thing solved, and it was solved by the Lord&#8217;s mercy.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE OF BARNABAS&#8217;S OPINION</h2><p>Right after that, another trouble came up. This trouble was Barnabas&#8216;s opinion (vv. 35-39). He wanted to bring his cousin John Mark with him to go on in the ministry with Paul. But Paul realized that Mark should be disciplined. He should not be easily permitted to come back to the ministry on his own. This was because he had withdrawn from the ministry in Pamphylia on their last trip. Thus, Paul intended to discipline Mark so that he could learn, but Barnabas was opinionated. He quarreled with Paul, and there was a big division.<p>When Paul was a new convert, Barnabas ushered him into the church and into the ministry (11:22-26). At first Barnabas was the one who took the lead. Even when they were sent on their first trip, Barnabas was the leader at the beginning (13:1-2). Later in their journey, however, Paul began to take the lead in the apostolic ministry (13:9; 14:12). After Paul was in the lead, Barnabas eventually became opinionated, not in secular things but in the holy ministry. If the Bible did not have such a record, we could never imagine that Barnabas could be that much opinionated to insist on taking his cousin with them. Paul and Barnabas were divided not by a great doctrine such as that of the Divine Trinity but because of Barnabas&#8217;s cousin.<h2 class=head1>THE TROUBLE OF APOLLOS&#8217;S OLDNESS AND OPINION</h2><p>Another trouble arose later with a new Jewish convert named Apollos. He was acquainted with the Bible and eloquent in teaching the Bible. A great number of people were helped through his teaching, yet he was behind in the revelation of God&#8217;s up-to-date economy. He knew only the baptism of John. He did not know that there was an advance after John. That advance was the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God. If you read only 18:24-28, you may admire Apollos. This positive record shows that he was very much helped in the way of God by Aquila and Priscilla. This couple was up-to-date with God&#8217;s present-day economy, and they helped him.<p>But chapter nineteen of Acts shows us the unique result of Apollos&#8217;s work in Ephesus. This result shows us that he did not change. If he had been adjusted by Aquila and Priscilla, he would have adjusted these twelve disciples in Ephesus who had been baptized only into John&#8217;s baptism (vv. 1-7). He would have told them that they needed to be baptized again into the name of the Lord Jesus. He would have said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I haven&#8217;t brought you into the present move of God&#8217;s economy. I am short of this. Now I have received the help, so I want to adjust you.&#8221; If he would have done this, there would have been no need for Paul to come and help these men be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. This proves that although Aquila and Priscilla worked to help Apollos, he did not practice what he was helped with. This shows that it is not so easy for us to drop our old way. The best athletes are trained to drop their natural way. Good pianists also must drop their natural way and take the trained way. The natural way is the old way.<p>On the one hand, Apollos was very much helped by Aquila, yet he did not practice what he was helped with. We know this because the result of his work still remained as something old. Acts 18 says that Aquila and Priscilla taught him the way of God. Surely they would have taught him about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus. This was probably the first item that Aquila and Priscilla told Apollos. God did not tolerate John&#8217;s continuing in his ministry once the Lord Jesus appeared on the scene, and he was eventually beheaded. I do believe Aquila would have told Apollos about this. Those twelve disciples in Ephesus should have been adjusted by Apollos before Paul arrived but they were not. People who read Acts 18 admire Apollos, but Acts 19 shows that he caused trouble. When he was in Ephesus, he left twelve there with a problem.<p>Later Apollos brought a problem to Corinth by causing an opinion among the saints. Some there said, &#8220;I am...of Apollos&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:12). Paul deals with the problem of division in the first four chapters of 1 Corinthians. Then at the end of 1 Corinthians Paul said, &#8220;And concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him many times to come to you with the brothers; yet it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity&#8221; (16:12). This means that Paul begged Apollos to go back to Corinth. Apollos should have gone back to tell the Corinthians not to say that they were of Apollos. But Apollos told Paul that he would not go then. Instead, he would go when he had the opportunity. That was his opinion.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED TO DEAL WITH OUR OPINIONS AND OLDNESS</h2><p>One major thing which shows you that you are not opinionated is that you simply follow the brothers. This is not so easy, especially if you are older than the other brothers. It is also not easy for many of the sisters to follow the brothers. Some sisters may say that God is not fair, because the woman must always be under the man (1 Cor. 11:3). Even after they get saved and come into the church, they still hold this opinion.<p>There was a co-worker among us many years ago who was very opinionated. Brother Nee once said to me, &#8220;This brother is a very good brother. Whenever you ask him to go west, he will go east.&#8221; The brothers got to know this peculiarity in this brother&#8217;s character, so when they wanted him to go west, they would ask him to go east. Then he would go west. This kind of nature is still in our blood. We are not so willing to follow others.<p>At the time Paul wrote 1 Corinthians, everybody knew that he was a leading one. If such a leading one proposes something to you, you should take his proposal. At that time Paul had a heavy burden for the church in Corinth. Some there were saying that they were of Apollos. Surely if Apollos would have gone there, his going would have been a great help. I believe Paul explained this to him when he advised him to go to see them, but Apollos refused to go. In principle Apollos should have gone even out of politeness, but he was so strong to say that he would go at another time. He did not want to go at Paul&#8217;s proposal but at his convenience. This was his opinion.<p>There are a number of ways to take from Anaheim to the airport in Los Angeles. Sometimes the brothers may have different opinions about which way to take. The more they discuss which way to take, however, the more time they waste. It is better to let the driver of the car make the decision, and not express any opinion.<p>Throughout the years I have seen the damage caused by opinions. When I was on mainland China with Brother Nee, he was like a big umbrella taking the lead. All the troubles from opinions went to him. Then the Lord brought me out of China and put me in the Western world, where I had to take the lead. I saw the damage caused by different opinions. Very rarely did I adjust these opinions, because I do not like to make an issue of anything.<p>Now that you are in the full-time training, you have to learn how to take the regulations. Regulations do not give you any ground for opinion. When you drive a car, you have your choice, but when you get on a train, you do not have any choice. Now that you are in the training, you are on the train. That means you are under the regulations. The training gives you the regulations to help you grow in life, and these regulations spontaneously kill your opinion.<p>I have seen many of the Lord&#8217;s servants through the years. The most useful ones are the ones without opinions. They do not care for their opinions. They care for only one thing-the main goal. They stick themselves to the main goal, which is the carrying out of God&#8217;s purpose. If a driver&#8217;s main purpose is to get to the airport in Los Angeles, what way we take to get there does not really matter. To debate about which way to take is to waste time. You have to learn how to stick yourself to the main goal. Forget about different ways to express your opinion. You young saints who are learning how to serve must learn this one thing.<p>The thirty items of a proper character, to which I referred in the previous message, are very helpful to us. But in another sense, each of these items is your enemy. Each item is your enemy because each item regulates you. This regulation is a killing. Each of the thirty items of a proper character kills your opinion. Your problem in serving the Lord is your opinion.<p>One trainee told us that the rooms in which the trainees stayed were too small. Every opinionated person is a good-hearted one. If you did not have a heart for anything, you would have no opinion. A piece of stone has no opinion, but because your heart is strong and good, you have an opinion. If you did not have a heart for others, you would have no opinion. Because this trainee has a good heart for the other trainees, his opinion came out. When you come to a new place and do not express any opinion, that is wonderful.<p>When I was young, I read a story about a father and a boy with a donkey. When they went through one village, neither of them rode on the donkey. Some people in that village criticized them by saying, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t one of them ride on the donkey?&#8221; Then the father told the son to ride on the donkey. When they passed through the second village, somebody criticized them by saying, &#8220;This little boy is no good. His father is so old, but he rides and his father walks.&#8221; When they heard this criticism, the father decided to ride on the donkey. Then they passed through the third village, and some there criticized the father for riding on the donkey and making his son walk. Eventually, due to all this criticism, they got rid of the donkey. That meant they got rid of the item for people to criticize. All such criticisms are opinions. We have to admit that we are absolutely like this. If I did not have the mercy based upon what the Lord has been teaching me through the years, my opinions might be much more than yours.<p>All the guests who stay in others&#8217; homes have opinions about the way things are there. I have learned the lesson by the Lord&#8217;s mercy that when I am someone&#8217;s guest, I would go only to the place which my host assigned to me. I would eat whatever is set before me without any opinion. Could you learn not to express any opinion in any kind of situation? If you learn this lesson, you will be useful in the Lord&#8217;s hand.<p>Both opinions and oldness are big enemies to us. For us to be useful in the Lord&#8217;s hand we must deal with these things. I have been reading the Bible for many years, and I have expounded the entire New Testament. But whenever I come to a portion of the Word, I do not consider that I know that much, because I want to see more. If I could have another series of Life-studies on the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, these Life-studies would be new and different. Our understanding of the Word should not be set or settled. We must always keep ourselves so young, new, and fresh with a learning and open spirit when we come to the Bible.<p>The technology in the world is always improving, but much of the time we remain the same in the Lord&#8217;s work. If we stay in our oldness, the Lord cannot move on. We must learn these two things-never to be old and not to have any opinion. I assure you that if you would not be old, revelation will come to you every day. Oldness covers your view and causes you to be opaque. It covers your inner eyes to prevent you from seeing something new of the Lord. The trouble with today&#8217;s Christianity is oldness. They say they keep the truth, but actually they are keeping their oldness. They would not have any kind of adjustment according to the revelation of the Bible. Peter and Apollos both remained in their oldness. To remain in their oldness was for them to be natural.<p>Your oldness will kill you, and your opinion will bury you. Look at the real situation. Out of one hundred, it is difficult to find five who are not old and who are without opinion. In this training you have to practice what I have told you. First, we saw that life grows by regulation toward maturity and function. Then we saw that oldness is versus revelation and opinion is versus obedience. If you are an opinionated person, you cannot obey anyone.<p>This is not a message to stir you up. This is a message that would put you down in your oldness and in your opinion. These two things are the prominent troubles in the book of Acts. While the Lord was going on in His move with Peter, the Lord encountered trouble. The Lord wanted to go on from the Jews to the Gentiles, to the ones who were unclean in the eyes of the Jews. He wanted Peter to contact them. For Peter to eat the unclean things was for him to contact the Gentiles, but Peter had his old concept.<p>The apostle Paul, however, was bold to go to the Gentiles. He did not just eat with them but he went to the Gentiles, city after city, to set up churches among them. He took the vision and dropped the oldness. He was altogether new. Before he met the Lord on the road to Damascus, he was very stubborn, but his revelation caused him to drop his oldness.<p>Paul was more stubborn than Peter, but Peter did not drop his oldness thoroughly and absolutely. We know this because of what Paul told us in Galatians 2. Peter shrank back from eating with the Gentile believers out of fear of those of the circumcision (vv. 11-13). This shows that Peter was not absolute. Although Paul was younger than Peter, he rebuked Peter to his face for his hypocrisy.<p>It is hard to see any signs in the New Testament that Paul was opinionated. Yet we see two persons related to him who were very opinionated-Barnabas and Apollos. On the one hand, he had trouble with Barnabas&#8217;s opinion; on the other hand, he had trouble with Apollos&#8217;s opinion. So these two dear brothers were through with working together with Paul. Aquila was different. Timothy was also different. When Paul asked Timothy to remain somewhere, he remained (1 Tim. 1:3). When Paul asked Timothy to come to him, he came (2 Tim. 4:21a). Apollos was a good brother who knew the Bible, but when Paul urged him to go to Corinth, he would not go. He did not want to go at Paul&#8217;s desire, but at his desire. Today in the ministry we have the same trouble.<p>The full-time training is to train you to take the regulations. That means that you are being trained to drop the oldness and you are learning not to have any opinions. You have to get out of your oldness. Also, as long as the church and the ministry are going on toward the main goal, you have to forget your opinions.</body></html>
