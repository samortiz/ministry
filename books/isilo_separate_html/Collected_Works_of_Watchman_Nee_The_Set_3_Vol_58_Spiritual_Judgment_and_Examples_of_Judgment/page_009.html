We also realize that there is a need for us to go through dealings before the Lord. In this chapter we will consider two additional matters.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF DIAGNOSIS</h2><p>When we try to touch others' condition with our spirit, we may touch their words and spirit. But this does not mean that we can diagnose their problem or even heal their sickness. It is one thing to touch others' spirit and another thing to diagnose it. Touching others' spirit merely enables us to know the condition of their spirit. After we have touched others' spirit, how should we interpret the condition we have touched? Is the spirit we have touched proper? How do we know whether it is or not? After we have touched others' words and touched the spirit behind the words, how should we diagnose the data? This is not a simple task. We must have broad and adequate training before we can know others' sicknesses. For example, a brother may speak to us, and we may sense that he has such a quick temper. If we are not trained adequately, we do not know the reason he has such a temper. An experienced person can tell us that temper comes from pride. A man has a temper because he cannot stand other people ignoring his words. Or he may have very little tolerance for uncomplimentary words. He may also look down on others. We can trace the problem back to his pride. He has a temper because he is inwardly filled with pride. Many people, however, do not realize that temper is merely a symptom; it is not the cause of the sickness. If we realize that temper is merely a symptom, we will search for its cause. But if we are not properly trained, we will not be able to find the root cause. A fever is not the cause of a sickness but a symptom. It is not enough for us to know that someone has a fever; we have to find the cause of the fever before he can be healed.</p><p>Touching others' spirit with our spirit is like measuring body temperature with a thermometer. However, we also must find the cause of the sickness. If we cannot find the reason a man has a temper, we cannot deal with him. It is useless to exhort a man with a temper to be patient. He will always lose his temper. We have to find the reason for his temper. We have to learn the lesson ourselves. We have to find the reason we lose our own temper. If we are clear about ourselves, we can apply our diagnosis to others. Diagnosis is one step towards a cure, and the actual healing is another step. In judging a man, first we have to feel him with our spirit; second, we have to discern him with our spirit; third, we have to diagnose the cause of the sickness; and fourth, we have to render the healing. As we continually practice this on ourselves as well as on others, we will find that pride and subjectivity both lead to temper. Some people lose their temper when their subjective views cannot be accepted. Others lose their temper when their great aspirations fail them or they become frustrated.</p><p>We have to learn to make observations all the time. Brother Sparks once said, "Be observant." In helping others we have to find the root of the sickness so that they can go to the Lord to be dealt with. In order to render others proper help, we have to have the right words to describe the symptoms as well as the cause of the sickness. We have to pray over every case that is presented to us, and we have to examine our brothers and sisters. In the matter of crying, for example, one sister may cry easily, while another one may not cry at all. Our spirit may sense this condition, but we may not know how to diagnose it. What should we do? We have to learn that crying and not crying are both symptoms. We have to find the reason for the crying. Which is right, crying or not crying? Should we advise a sister to cry or not to cry? With some, crying is wrong, and we should tell them not to cry. With others, crying is right, and we should advise them to cry. It all depends on the cause. We should find the cause in ourselves first. We often are our own best teacher. We can ask ourselves, "When do I cry? Why do I cry?" Simply put, there are two reasons for crying. The first is self-love. One loves himself, pities himself, and will not let go of himself. He may think in his heart, "I am such a nice person, yet I suffer these things." The more he thinks about it, the more he feels sorry for himself, and he cries. He cannot bear seeing himself suffer so much. His experience stirs up his self-pity, and he cries. A man's self-love often is asleep until some experiences stir up his self-love. The first reason for crying is self-love. The second reason for crying is that a man is smitten by God. A person may be unbending, hard, indifferent, and unyielding. It is difficult for him to cry or to smile. But after he goes through repeated trials and God's hand deals heavily with him, he is subdued. He then cries because he has been weakened by God. This is the second reason for crying. There are at least two reasons for crying. When someone cries, we can compare these reasons with the case in hand, and we can identify the source of the crying. Crying is not necessarily right, but those who are smitten by God can surely cry. Crying is not necessarily good, but if a man has never cried, he has never been subdued by God. If a man says, "I have never cried," we immediately know that he is a hard person.</p><p>Some people are very stubborn before God. They have suffered many trials and have experienced much chastisement from God. Nevertheless, they have not learned any spiritual lessons or acquired any spiritual knowledge. Others become very sensitive through much suffering. Nevertheless, they have not learned any spiritual lessons either. Those who have passed through many trials and experienced much discipline from the Holy Spirit should have learned many lessons. Yet both of these kinds of people have not learned anything. One group is hard, the other group is soft, and both have gone through many trials. Why has neither group learned any spiritual lessons? We have to find the reason for this. We must not only know the symptoms but must find the root of the illness. As soon as a man becomes hardened before God, his trials will not produce any spiritual effect or bring in any spiritual blessing. Instead, they only will remain painful experiences. In the process of making pottery, a potter discards some vessels because they are ruined and spoiled in the turning process. Some people are like the ruined vessels. They have argued with God and murmured against His dealings. They have not submitted to His discipline. They think that it is wrong for others to ride over their heads (Psa. 66:12). They want God to let them ride over others' heads instead. They are discouraged by the discipline they have suffered. They think that they are misunderstood, that God's way is wrong, and that they are right. They have never submitted themselves to God's discipline. They have never learned to thank and praise. Because of the hardness of their heart, they have not learned any lessons at all. Others, however, appear to be very sensitive. They also have suffered many trials and experienced the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Yet they have not learned any spiritual lessons or acquired any spiritual knowledge either. The discipline of the Holy Spirit has not produced any effect on them because they are short of the supply of the ministry of the word.</p><p>We have to learn to know men's condition, and we have to learn to diagnose their condition. It is not enough to know that a man has a temperature of forty degrees Celsius. We have to know the reason for his fever. We cannot say that a man has a fever because he is generally weak. We have to make observations. We have to be like a doctor who studies diligently for three to five years before daring to practice his trade. We must be meek and open before the Lord. We have to confess our mistakes and acknowledge our own untrustworthiness all the time. If we practice this again and again, we will not only become sensitive in our spirit, but we will be able to discern the symptoms and causes of sicknesses in the brothers and be able to render them healing as well. We have asked the trainees here on the mountain to each give their testimony. This not only touches the spiritual condition of each trainee but opens the way for diagnosis and healing. I hope we all will learn many lessons from this exercise in judgment.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
