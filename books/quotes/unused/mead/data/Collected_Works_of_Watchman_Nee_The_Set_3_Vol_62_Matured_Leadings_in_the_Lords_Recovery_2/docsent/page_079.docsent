   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How to Have a Right Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we have a right spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A man's spirit carries his own taste and color.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When our spirit is released, it expresses the tastes and color of our very person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to be right in our spirit, we have to go through dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The quality of a man determines the quality of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a man is regenerated, the new spirit that God gives him is the same in quality as that which is given to any other person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a man learns little and goes through few dealings, his spirit will remain in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Doctrinally, this matter is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man with a good mind can repeat the content, tone, teaching, and style of a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He may think that he has the right spirit by doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we can observe a very interesting thing among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They can pick up others' doctrines, yet their spirit remains unchanged; the two will not mix.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A brother can be the same as others are in words and tone, but his spirit will remain the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There will not be any advance; his spirit will not be any purer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man does not have a pure spirit, he will find that his spirit is incompatible with the good words released from those with a pure spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He can give another person's message, but he will not have the other person's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord has given me a burden to test if young workers are qualified to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most brothers and sisters think that in working for the Lord the main thing is to have right teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I only pay ten percent of my attention to a person's message.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I pay ninety percent of my attention to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A man can give a logical message but have a rebellious, coarse, nit-picking, evil, proud, or hardened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The unbelievers can only be proud; they cannot have a proud spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Christian can have a proud spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he opens his mouth, he releases his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a Christian has a wrong motive in his heart, the spirit he releases will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A young person can pray for breaking; he can give a message on breaking, but his very person may still not be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible for a man to deceive himself, but it is not easy to deceive God and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church can tell where a person is from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A man's spirit is the place where God works and dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God leaves His imprint in a man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A brother once wrote to me, saying, "All the brothers and sisters say that I am wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even you say that I am wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It seems that everyone is right and I am always wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since all of you say that I am wrong, I will just say that I am wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a word conveyed a hardened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After I read the letter, I wrote back to him, saying, "The more you are smitten, the harder you become.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more you are dealt with, the less you submit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your words and conduct may be right, but your spirit is wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A few months ago, I saw this brother again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His spirit was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He had not picked up more doctrines, but the quality of his spirit was enhanced.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have the same opportunity to exercise our spirit as any other brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a certain person has greater wisdom, eloquence, ability, and gift than you do, he does not necessarily have greater opportunity to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God arranges all circumstances and things with the goal of dealing with ourselves and training our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, we have to give in more to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here we need to speak about the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit is not only in us as our life; He is ordering our circumstances for the purpose of training us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He knows the kind of environment that is best for us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every environment that comes upon us has been measured by our God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The unbelievers have accidents and coincidences, but not a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus tells us that every hair on our head is numbered by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A sparrow may not be worth much.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a man buys four, he gets one extra for free.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But without the Father's permission, not one will fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are more precious than the birds Matt 10:29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Everything that is happening to us in our environment, even the falling of a hair and the grounding of a bird, is under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The purpose of this sovereignty is to perfect us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The daily discipline of the Holy Spirit is for the purpose of dealing with the self and destroying it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way the quality of the spirit is enhanced and purified.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we seek for ease and comfort and run away from the Spirit-ordered environments, we may reduce our troubles, but the quality of our spirit will not be enriched and purified.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who have an impoverished spirit were not impoverished at the beginning; they became impoverished because they refused to allow the Lord to work in them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we are willing to submit ourselves to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, our spirit will become strong and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A person may be a Christian for twenty or thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He may even have been a revivalist conducting revivals for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These things do not impress me at all.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>With some people we do not sense any noble quality in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a man's spirit is good, we will feel refreshed and anointed as soon as we touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All the lessons that we have learned are impregnated in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is impossible to pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more we try to pretend, the more our falsehood will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many people like to pretend to be spiritual in front of me; they want my approval.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A sister in Shanghai once said that Brother Nee never praises anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She thought that no one was up to my standard.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Actually, the only One who is qualified to approve of anyone is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A spiritual man will find the Lord's approval automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If your spirit is wrong, what use is there for me to say that I like you or that I approve you?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some people hate with all their heart but say that they love with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What comes out of the mouth is love, but what comes out of the spirit is hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we are experienced, we will know as soon as we touch one's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A man can pretend and cheat others, but he can never hide his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Many people are right in their words and thoughts, but they are wrong in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The quality of our spirit is governed by the extent of discipline of the Holy Spirit we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When the Holy Spirit condemns something, we should go along with Him and condemn the same.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit every day and learn to deal with our self, we will advance every day.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We may not be conscious of our own progress, but others will know.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In Shanghai people often knock on my door and ask to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When they see me, they ask, "Brother Nee, has my spirit made any progress?"</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Those who ask such questions usually have not made any progress.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Progress is not something that we can easily detect in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Others know how our spirit is, but we do not need to know, and it is best that we not know.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Moses' face shone, but he did not know it.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It was the Israelites who saw it Exo 34:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Suppose a man looks into a mirror all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Do you think he will find himself greatly changed from the day before?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Do you think that he will know whether or not he has grown?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I have never seen such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>No one should consider his spiritual condition all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>All we need is to learn as much as we can in our spirit.</S>
