   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lesson of Knowing the Self</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following this, God told Moses to put his hand into his bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He put it in his bosom, and when he took it out, it was leprous as snow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the second lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we have to cast the rod in our hand on the ground to expose the true face of the serpent and then take it by the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we have to do a second thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not enough for us to follow Moses in casting down our rod.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need a second lesson, which is to follow Moses in putting our hand into our bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we take out our hand, it becomes leprous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The bosom signifies what we are in our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Leprosy signifies our sin Rom 7:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This tells us that there is no goodness within ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to see that we have nothing and are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church I see many brothers and sisters who criticize, judge, and complain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am quite angry at this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe these brothers and sisters do not realize that leprosy is hidden in their bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we know our flesh, we will not dare criticize the brothers, even when we feel the urge to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know our own leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know that people of the same kind congregate together, that we are the same as they, and that we are equally unclean within ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as our praise, love, and sympathy come from ourselves, they are leprous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Newton's hymn says that he hated his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once a man sees himself and knows himself, he will not dare criticize others easily.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He will see that he is not qualified to criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord forgives me for saying this: Every time I want to say something about my brothers and sisters, the Lord shows me my own leprosy, my uncleanness, and my defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No matter how wrong the brothers and sisters are and how hurt I have been, I dare not criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is nothing within me that qualifies me for the Lord's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the grace of God that makes me what I am 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I know myself this way, I will put up no resistance and will humble myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will remove the leprosy from among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not be dissatisfied with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should only hate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who see a clear picture of themselves will realize that they are but a heap of dirt, trash, corruption, and filth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are nothing but the embodiment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Except for the mercy of God, they are not worthy to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once we see this, we will have many confessions and prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lesson of Knowing the World</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to know God's work, not only must we know the usurpation of Satan and the corruption of our own flesh, but we must also know the evil of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The third miracle that God showed Moses was this: "Take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land" Exo 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The river refers to the Nile which irrigates the entire land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It signifies the fallen worldly enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Egypt is a type of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Bible, Egypt was rich with produce and enjoyed its abundance through the supply of the river Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Nile was the very life and life supply of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Blood is a sign of death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the surface the Nile brings supply and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But in God's eyes it is death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The world may enjoy its abundance and excellence, and we may be poor, stricken, and destitute.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may see our classmates prospering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They might not have done so well in school, yet today they are enjoying everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This makes our pain all the more acute.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But once we see the water turning into blood, we will realize that man's enjoyment of everything houses, cars, etc. is but the drinking of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we see that our support is a serpent, that there is nothing but uncleanness within us, and that everything is blood, we will no longer remain in delusion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord said that only the water that He gives will make men thirst no more John 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A thirsty man will never be satisfied with the water of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only the water that the Lord gives will quench man's thirst, and only this water will meet the needs of our work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May we remember these three principles.</S>
