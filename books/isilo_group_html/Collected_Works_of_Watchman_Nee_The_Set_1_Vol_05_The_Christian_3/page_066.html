Their boasting is stronger and stronger! How serious is this kind of self-contentment! "Is it wrong to be self-contented?" For those who are poor for the Lord, self-contentment is something the Lord is pleased with. But the Lord is not pleased with the self-contentment of the rich ones, nor is He pleased with the seeking that comes from discontentment. What the Lord wants is for a man to be discontented for his lack of riches before God and his poverty before men. The rich ones should long to be poor! Is Laodicea that easily satisfied? If not, why is it so self-contented here? Indeed, it has received too much, so much so that it has to declare, "I have need of nothing." For it to say such a word, how many riches does it need to have? Yet how base is such a believer's heart, who is satisfied only with the world and its riches! How easily it is filled and satisfied! What is the meaning of having need of nothing? "I only want to enjoy the world. If I can live forever on earth, I will be satisfied. What I have now is heaven already. What other heaven do I want? I have lack of nothing. Everything is now mine. I have everything there is in this world. What else can satisfy my heart?" The resurrection of the righteous, the coming of Christ, and the glory of the kingdom are all forgotten. As such they are no longer objects of pursuit. These persons are the two and a half tribes of Israelites on the east side of Jordan. Indeed, the riches of money will bring a believer to the position of Laodicea, but is this self-uplifting restricted to money only? The Laodicean attitude is manifested in almost everything. Every time we read a report of a denomination, a mission, or a certain organization, we can see the special manifestation of the spirit of Laodicea. It seems as if the word "Laodicea" is written all over them. Even those who are more spiritual are merely saying, "God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men-extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector" (Luke 18:11).</P><P>How numerous are the nominal Christians! How frequent are the fundraisings! How grand are the buildings! How much the order of the meetings fits the mentality of ordinary men! How successful are the charitable works, the medical works, and the educational works! How qualified, learned, and knowledgeable are the pastors and the preachers! They are so profound and knowledgeable that they can even tell which part of the Scripture is inspired and which part is not! Indeed, if one is to pick up his pen and write about any kind of work or the condition of any worker before the Lord, there is supposedly always so much to write about! Yet this is the Laodicea that the Lord condemns.</P><P>We have said before that there are many kinds of Laodiceas. The principle of Laodicea is very simple: to consider oneself as the center, to think highly of oneself, and to be self-satisfied and self-contented. In one word, Laodicea is just "self." But in the church of the age of Laodicea, there are saved and overcoming ones, there are saved and defeated ones, there are unsaved and unregenerated ones, and there are unbelievers. Needless to say, the overcoming ones are free from the spirit of Laodicea, but other than the overcomers, all the others are under the direction of the self. However, because of the difference in their personal condition, they are different in their Laodicean conduct. This is why we say that there are many kinds of Laodiceas.</P><P>We thank God that many believers have been taught personally by God of the importance of holiness and perfection and are seeking after these things earnestly. However, even among these dear brothers, one can find the conduct of Laodicea. Brothers, I am not discouraging people from pursuing after perfection. This is indeed what we also teach. But I would remind the brothers not to be affected by Laodicea. It is a wonderful desire to be seeking and to preach to others. But why is there the need to bring in the "I"? "I have obtained it. I became perfected on such and such a date. After such and such a meeting, I have received such and such certain experience. Now I am perfected. My sinful nature is eradicated. The root of sin has been uprooted from my heart. I have a clean heart already." Why bring in this "I"? It is true that we can testify, but the strange thing is that no one at the time of the apostles testified of their sanctification. If one needs to talk about his experience, it is better to wait "fourteen years" (2 Cor. 12:2) before he relates his wonderful experience! Actually, if one truly is sanctified experientially, those around him will certainly have detected it. If one thinks that he must say this before he can be ranked among the better believers, Laodicea has already crept in. Moreover, if those around you do not see anything special about you, will they not despise the teaching of sanctification because of this?</P><P>It is true that believers should be perfect, but unless we take the conduct and life of Christ as the standard of perfection, we are lowering the standard of sanctification. And if we think that we are comparable to Christ now and are not ashamed in our heart or blush in our face to say this, we are already either excessively pharisaical or have become champions of self-boasting! When we uplift ourselves in this way, it is natural for us to call sin and lust by other names when we fail. If a man thinks that he has reached "sinless perfection," he will have to call lust a temptation and sin a weakness whenever he falls! But this kind of covering-up, self-forgiving, and changing of names does not remove the fact. Why argue over a term? You may say that this is weakness, but I say that this is sin, while in reality we all recognize the existence of such a thing, whatever you may call it. Hence, we must not go to the extreme and must not place ourselves in an improper position. </P><P>Moreover, this kind of subconscious self-boasting is very harmful to our spiritual life. This causes us to become overly concerned with ourselves. It causes us to think of ourselves, express ourselves, and be conscious of ourselves. Many times, it may be "no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20) in word only. In reality, it is a fully self-conscious, self-admiring, self-marveling, self-loving, glorified, and transformed "I" that is reigning there. We have to realize that in spiritual life the thing to avoid the most is to think of ourselves and to linger around ourselves. When our physical life is healthy, it is not conscious of itself. If a man thinks about his heartbeat and his breathing, it does not help him. On the contrary, it will hurt him. Only those who are sick feel that they are better today than yesterday. Hence, if this Laodicean self-conscious holiness is not removed, all that it will give to man is a low, fallen, and sick Christian life. This kind of Laodicean self-satisfaction is really far from the mark.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 05: The Christian (3) &nbsp; pg 66</div><br></body></html>
