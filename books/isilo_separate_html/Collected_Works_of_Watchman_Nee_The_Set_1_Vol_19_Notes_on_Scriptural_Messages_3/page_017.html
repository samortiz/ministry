Every man has these things, but he does not have them all the time. It is something often done but not done at all times. What are these things? They are tears. I wonder if you know the importance of tears. If a person is able to shed tears, it is a good sign. Someone who had very deep spiritual experiences once said, "If you give your love to someone who cannot shed tears, you might as well ask a pickpocket to keep your purse for you." This is a true statement. If you give your love to someone who cannot shed tears, you will be as disappointed as if you asked a pickpocket to keep your purse for you. Tears are something that the world cannot do without. Anyone who cannot shed tears has lost his characteristic as a man and cannot be counted as a man.</P><P>I do not like to see men who are so proud that they consider shedding tears to be something that men should not do. Some even consider that it is a sign of courage not to shed tears. Some think that by not shedding tears, they appear to be better and more outstanding than others. I am afraid that this is not at all true! I would say rather that a dry eye indicates that there is a dry and hardened heart within such persons. It tells us that the heart is defiant, has no feeling, and is numb like wood and stone. Many times shedding tears reveals a person's heart. Nothing reveals what is in the heart as much as tears do. Therefore, tears are the outlet of the heart.</P><P>How do we know this? Suppose I am extremely sad today; I cannot sigh, talk, eat, sleep, or work. What should I do in order to alleviate my sorrow? Suppose you go to ask a physician if he has a cure for someone who is so sorrowful. If he understands psychology, he would say that such a one should have his best friend over for a heart-to-heart talk or for a few good jokes so that he can let out his frustrations. Perhaps he should visit a scenic place, take a walk in a grassy meadow, or listen to music that will cheer him up and cause him to forget whatever has made him sorrowful. But none of these things will work. If the doctor is experienced in human life, he would say, "Let him cry his heart out and everything will be solved." Whenever you are heavily pressed within and unable to be relieved, a few tears will vent your frustration and the whole thing will be over. It is quite amazing that something within your heart must come out through your eyes, as though the eyes are the outlet of the heart. Once the tears are shed, the heart is opened.</P><P>I remember that there was once a person with a physical handicap. He was quite angry about the defect in his body. Nothing seemed to please him, and he wanted to end his life. For seven years anger burned constantly within him like a flame. One day he went to a great concert. The whole audience thought the concert was marvelous, and their souls were all carried away into a rapturous and soothing ecstasy. But what did this one do? He shed a few tears. Someone asked him, "Was not today's music beautiful? Why did you shed tears?" He replied, "Before the concert I was bored and very, very sad. But after listening to the music and shedding some tears, everything is all right." The music punctured a hole in his heart so that the tears were able to flow out. Originally, depression locked up his heart. When the tears flowed out, his depression was washed away with the tears. The human side of his nature was expressed. In the beginning, his nature was bound and locked up by his depression; but now it was released by tears. The shedding of tears shows a man that he still has his human nature within. Through tears, a man is made human. Some people consider tears to be a sign of weakness. No! On the contrary, the inability to shed tears means that a man lacks humanity or has buried his humanity.</P><P>Tears are the common portion of men on earth. For this reason, our Lord also shed tears. Though the Bible records His joy, it never records His laughter. On the contrary, it records His tears. In Hebrews 5:7 we see that the Lord's tears are plural. This shows us that He often shed tears. Isaiah 53 also says that He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.</P><P>Tears are very precious because only tears can wash man's eyes and make them clean. There is so much dust, dirt, and filth on this earth. These things are ready at any moment to invade your eyes. Fortunately, there are always tears to wash your eyes and give you clear eyesight. If the eyes did not have tears, I am afraid that no one could see anything through his eyes.</P><P>Tears have a cleansing function, not only in the physical realm, but also in the spiritual realm. A few more tears allow a person to see a little more clearly. Without tears our spiritual eyes will lose their function. Once Mr. Panton spoke to a young couple, "Although you are so good, you lack one thing. If you could do this thing, you would be perfect. You should pray for the Lord's soon return." That evening the husband told his wife, "This time we must listen to the word of this old gentleman. Tonight we must pray for this matter thoroughly." The husband prayed faithfully and hoped that his wife would pray after him. But she would not because she confidently said within herself, "I have a wonderful family. Our marriage relationship is harmonious and happy. Our living is quite pleasant, and our house is quite comfortable. Everything is wonderful. Why should I ask the Lord to come back soon? Let us not be in a rush." This continued for seven months until suddenly her husband died. Later on when she saw Mr. Panton, she held his hand and told him tearfully, "After seven months, I have been asking the Lord to come back soon every day." Tears had washed her eyes so that she was able to see clearly.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
