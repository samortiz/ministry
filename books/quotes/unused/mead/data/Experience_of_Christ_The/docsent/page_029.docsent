   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DOGS, EVIL WORKERS, AND THE CONCISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 3:2 says, "Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the verse Paul exhorts us to beware of three things dogs, evil workers, and the concision.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The fact that there is no conjunction in this verse indicates that these three things refer to one kind of person, a person who is a dog, an evil worker, and part of the concision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "evil" in this verse denotes something that is in rebellion against God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the Bible, any worker who is against God's regulation is an evil worker.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word concision is a contemptuous term for circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Originally the word circumcision was a term of honor among Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in this Epistle the Apostle Paul used not the word circumcision, but the word concision, a term of despite.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, when the Apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians, fleshly circumcision was no longer honorable, but dishonorable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, he used the term concision to diminish the honor of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the context of this verse, the dogs are the evil workers, and the evil workers are the concision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may wonder how the Jews, who were circumcised according to God's ordination, could become evil workers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The answer lies in the fact that God's dispensation has changed with the coming of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before the time of John the Baptist, God ordained that His people be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was God's administration, God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this economy, this dispensation, was terminated by the coming of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the present dispensation, God wants people to believe in Jesus Christ, His Son, and to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is God's present economy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Jews have not abandoned the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They prefer the old economy with the law of Moses to believing in Jesus Christ and receiving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, all their intentions in doing things for God are a form of rebellion, for they are rebelling against God's present economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is rebellious to refuse to believe in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In God's present economy, He has ordained that His Son should be the object of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God seems to say, "Listen to Him and believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not listen to others."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But most of the Jews prefer Moses and the law; they want to remain in the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not evil to love the law, but the attitude expressed in loving the law when God has changed the dispensation is evil and rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under the present dispensation of God, circumcision is not honorable, but dishonorable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before Him, it is no longer circumcision, but concision.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, Paul tells us to beware of dogs, of evil workers, and of the concision.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must beware of those who practice circumcision in rebellion against God's economy.</S>
