   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We drink of the Lord by calling, "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Let the wicked forsake his way,/And the evildoer, his thoughts;/And let him return to Jehovah, and He will have compassion on him;/And to our God, for He will pardon abundantly" v. 7 . The wicked one is the one who does not come to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the sight of God, it is wickedness not to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whoever does not believe in Christ, God regards as sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jehovah will have compassion on the one who returns to Him and will pardon him abundantly.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>and Our Ways Not Being His Ways</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"For My thoughts are not your thoughts,/And your ways are not My ways, declares Jehovah./For as the heavens are higher than the earth,/So are My ways higher than your ways,/And My thoughts higher than your thoughts" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>8-9 .</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"For just as the rain comes down/And the snow from heaven,/And does not return there,/Until it waters the earth/And makes it bear and sprout forth,/That it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater;/So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;/It will not return to Me vainly,/But it will accomplish what I delight in,/And it will prosper in the matter to which I have sent it."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to eat the word and drink of the water in the word so that we may be filled, renewed, strengthened, and transformed into His image for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Israel Going Out with Rejoicing</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and Being Led Forth in Peace</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"You will go out with rejoicing,/And you will be led forth in peace;/The mountains and the hills/Will break forth before you with a ringing shout,/And all the trees of the field will clap their hands./In place of the thorn bush, the fir tree will come up;/In place of the brier, the myrtle will come up;/And it will be to Jehovah as a name,/As an eternal sign that will not be cut off" vv.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To God, this will be an eternal memorial and an eternal sign.</S>
