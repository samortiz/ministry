   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN GOD'S LOVE, MERCY, GRACE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND RIGHTEOUSNESS Time: Spring 1937</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Canton</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: 1 John 4:16; John 3:16; Rom 3:24; 4:4; 5:8; 11:6; Eph 2:4, 8-9; Titus 3:5; 2 Cor 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Last night we saw that man was born a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We also saw that man has two kinds of sins: One is a power within which causes man to commit sins; the other is the outward acts of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The power of sin within causes man to sin; the outward acts of sins bring man into judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The sin within is the cause of man's perdition, while the sins without are the cause of God's righteous judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because man has committed sins outwardly, he needs to be saved, and because he possesses the inward sin, he needs to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because of the many sins without, man needs to be justified before God, and because of the inward sin which compels him to sin, man needs to be sanctified within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two kinds of sins are different in operation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God wants to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in order for Him to accomplish a full salvation, He needs to deal with the sin that is within as well as the sins that are without.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God only dealt with the outward sins, man's salvation would be incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The outward sins of Christians have been forgiven by the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet the inward power of sin still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you ask such a Christian, "Have your sins been forgiven?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will answer, "Yes, my sins have all been forgiven."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But every day he will continue to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After he sins, he will come back to ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because he has only received a half salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has not yet obtained a full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man is ignorant of himself and does not know who he is, he will look at himself and say, "I am not a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have no need of the Savior or salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But once he realizes that he is a sinner, what will he do?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose I am in a hospital, sick and about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Am I the one who is desperate, or is the hospital administrator the desperate one?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unless I am crazy with a high fever, surely I will be desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The hospital administrator cannot worry about me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He cannot worry about all the patients in Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he did, the hospital would have to render treatment to him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, many sinners are not concerned about their sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before the birth of the Lord Jesus, no one was prepared for the coming of the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ was born, no one had invited Him or made any preparations for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God Himself made the preparations for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man was not concerned about his own sins, but God was.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wanted to save us; therefore, He prepared a Savior for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since man is a sinner, is it not fitting that he should die and perish?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why did God need to be concerned?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why did God need to think of a way to save us?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This leads to another question: What has motivated God's salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE MOTIVATION FOR GOD'S SALVATION HIS LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man fell through sin and deserves death and perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But he has no intention to seek salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Salvation belongs to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is God who wants to save us; man has no intention of saving himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to God's Word, the motivation for God's salvation is His love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who become sinners do not love themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet God loves man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though man himself is not concerned or anxious, God is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man has no intention of saving himself, but God can find a way to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The greatest and most precious fact in the Bible is that God's thought towards man is love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Bible God's love has three aspects: 1 God is love 1 John 4:16 ; His very nature is love; 2 God loves the world John 3:16 ; God's feeling toward man is love; and 3 God's love is manifested through the cross Rom 5:8 ; this is the work of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God Being Love</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first aspect of God's love is that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What is the meaning of these words?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christians are very familiar with 1 John 4:16, which says that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This means that love is God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, I have a little brother who loves to ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He likes to ask questions about wild flowers, chalk, puppies, kittens, etc. Every time I see him, I am apprehensive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I may answer two or three or even ten of his questions, but I cannot answer his countless other questions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I see him, I address him as Mr. Question and give him some money to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Asking questions is part of his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why I call him Mr. Question.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In other words, he embodies the essence of a question.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Likewise, love is God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thank God that He is love.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Love is His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must realize that the greatest revelation in the Bible is that God is love.</S>
