<div class='line'><b>1</b> What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
<div class='line'>I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
<div class='line'>Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
<div class='line'>And my sins which were many are all washed away,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
<div class='line'>And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> There's a light in the valley of death now for me,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
<div class='line'>And the gates of the City beyond I can see,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
<div class='line'>And I'm happy, so happy as onward I go,</div>
<div class='line'>Since Jesus came into my heart!</div>
