   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Galatians 3:14 Paul says, In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse tells us that the Spirit is the blessing of the New Testament gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the blessing promised by God to Abraham for all the nations of the earth Gen 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The context of 3:14 indicates that the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham for all the nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is the compound Spirit, and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, for us to receive as our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the focus of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land Gen 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4 , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 , the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God s bountiful supply for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit in 3:14 is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This consummating and reaching Spirit is now the very reality of the Triune God as our blessing in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why after the Lord Jesus resurrected, He told His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 , immersing them into all that the Triune God is as their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a major point in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST AND PUTTING ON CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Galatians 3:27 says, As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here is another crucial point, that is, we have been baptized into Christ, and as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel is within us and the very Christ is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Within us essentially, He is our inner life, and upon us economically, He is our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is our life and life supply that satisfies us within, and He is our clothing that beautifies us without.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Essentially He is our life and life supply and economically He is our beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Galatians 4:4-7 is the crucial point of the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These verses say, When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law, that He might redeem those under law, that we might receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, an heir also through God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ s redemption is to bring us into the sonship of God that we might enjoy the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s economy is not to make us keepers of law, obeying the commandments and ordinances of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose, but to make us sons of God, inheriting the blessing of God s promise, which was given for His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression Heb 2:10; Rom 8:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship Eph 1:5 and regenerated us to be His sons John 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should remain in the reality of His sonship that we may become His heirs to inherit all He has planned for His eternal expression, and should not be distracted to Judaism by the appreciation of law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Triune God is producing many sons for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law that we might receive the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He also sent forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHRIST BEING FORMED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Galatians 1 Christ is revealed in us v. 16 , in chapter two Christ is living in us v. 20 , and in chapter four Christ is being formed in us v. 19 . Christ was born into the Galatian believers, but not formed in them, when they were regenerated through Paul s preaching of the gospel to them the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now the apostle travails again that Christ may be formed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ grown in us in full.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ was first born into us, revealed in us, at our conversion, then lives in us in our Christian life, and will be formed in us at our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is needed that we may be sons of full age, heirs to inherit God s promised blessing, and mature in the divine sonship.</S>
