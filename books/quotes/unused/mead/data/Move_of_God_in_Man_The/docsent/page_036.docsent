   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ died on the cross not only for our transgressions, wrongdoings, mistakes, offenses, but also for our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is an element or essence in our constitution, in our being, which is the inward sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are not only sinners; we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ died for us as such persons 2 Cor 5:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is what I call the intrinsic significance and the intrinsic understanding of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to be brought into the intrinsic understanding of all the matters related to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the cross, Christ died for all of us 2 Cor 5:14-15 , He crucified our old man Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20a , and He destroyed the devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we say that Christ destroyed the devil on the cross, someone may ask us how the devil can continue to work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Peter 5:8 tells us that Satan, as a roaring lion, still walks about, seeking someone to devour.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ did destroy Satan on the cross, but Satan still lives and acts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to explain this, we can use what happens in a law court as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The verdict of the law court is one thing, but the execution of the verdict, the sentence, the judgment, is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the verdict, someone may be condemned to death, but he is still living because there has not yet been an execution of the verdict, the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Satan has been judged to be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the verdict upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the execution of this verdict, this judgment, is in the process of being carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today how do we apply God's judgment, God's verdict, upon His enemy?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This depends on our spiritual condition and the spiritual degree of maturity we have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person recently saved has not grown up and has not been perfected, or properly, spiritually educated, so he does not know anything about God's judgment, His verdict, upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But those who have been in the Lord for years know that Satan has been judged and that God has pronounced, or proclaimed, His verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now in our spirit with a strong spiritual condition and situation, we can execute God's judgment over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can tell him, "Satan, you have been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The place where you should be is the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Don't stay here."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to execute God's judgment over Satan continually until the day that he is actually cast into the lake of fire Rev 20:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to fight the spiritual warfare in this way, we need much teaching, perfecting, and growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although we are under Satan's attack, we are cooperating with the Lord to execute God's judgment upon him, and the Lord's recovery is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In His crucifixion, Christ also judged and crucified the world John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Galatians 6:14 the apostle Paul said the world was crucified to him and he to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the eyes of the worldly people, including many of our relatives, our schoolmates, and our friends, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not count as being anything in their sight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To them we know only Jesus, God, and the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that to the world we are crucified persons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The world is also crucified to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We no longer have any interest in the world with its attractions and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our unique interest is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the cross, Christ also tasted death for all things and reconciled all things to God Heb 2:9; Col 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, He abolished the law in ordinances and slew the enmity between peoples Eph 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Finally, in the positive aspect of His death, He released the divine life for the producing of the believers to constitute the Body of Christ John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to learn to know all these things concerning the crucifixion of Christ in an intrinsic way.</S>
