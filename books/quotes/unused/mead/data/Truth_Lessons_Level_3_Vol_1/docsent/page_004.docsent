   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that Christ as the tree of life is life to the believers in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That Christ is our life indicates that we are to enjoy Him daily as the food supply in our spirit, take Him as life and live by Him, and live Him in our daily life to experience Him, so that all that He is and has attained and obtained may become our subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, we can grow in His life to have His image and be like Him 2 Cor 3:18 , and we can bear the fruit of life as His spreading in life John 15:5 .</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s original intention was that man should eat of the tree of life Gen 2:9, 16 .</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the redemption of Christ, the way by which man could touch the tree of life was opened again Heb 10:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in the church s degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the Lord promised to grant as a reward to the overcomers, those who overcome all the distractions in the church s degradation and enjoy Christ as the tree of life, to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, which will be the supply of life for them to reign in the kingdom Rev 20:4b .</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL A. Typifying Satan as the Source of Sin and Evil</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signify two persons in the universe God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The tree of life typifies Christ as the embodiment of God, who is the source of life; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil typifies Satan as the source of sin and death.</S>

Therefore, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil must be a type of Satan as the source of sin and evil.</S>
