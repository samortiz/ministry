<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL FIRE</h2><p>Concerning the second point, that is, spiritual fire, I would like to say this: Fire relates to supply. Individually, it depends on our consecration. Corporately, it depends on fellowship, or the supply in the ministry. If there is no problem with our personal consecration, it may be God's leading that we should seek His supply. Corporately speaking, the matter of fire relates to fellowship. Without fellowship there is no fire. When we are in fellowship, we touch the fire. This is not a matter of gift, but of ministry. Where there is ministry, there is fire. Ministry is corporate. There is more in ministry than in individual pursuits, but we will cover this later. First, consider the individual aspect. Individually, we only need to check our consecration. If there is a problem with our consecration, there is a problem with the spirit. There must be an absolute consecration. Otherwise, there is no fire.</p><p>Fire is from the Lord. The Lord casts this fire on earth. This fire is also the gospel. It enables us to serve, to withstand persecution, and even to sacrifice our lives. On the personal side, fire depends absolutely on our consecration. The amount of consecration we offer on the altar determines the intensity of the fire. If consecration is lacking, the fire will not come. Therefore, we cannot hold back anything in our consecration.</p><p>Consecration, in turn, comes from light. We consecrate to God according to the light we have received. We can only consecrate according to what we have received, according to what our spiritual eyes can see. The light we see comes from our fellowship with God. Through constant fellowship, God shines on us and grants us revelation. When we are under His shining, we see His demand and consecrate ourselves to Him voluntarily. Then God sends down His fire to take up our consecration. Hence, fire comes from God and is communicated to us through consecration; we do not light the fire ourselves. This is the fire on the altar. Once the sacrifice is on the altar, the fire comes. Consecration is not a one-time act, but a continual act. In the beginning we do not know what we should consecrate. Gradually, we receive more light, and we consecrate more, and our consecration becomes more absolute. The stronger our consecration is, the greater is the fire on the altar. Consecration follows shining. The amount of shining we receive determines the degree of consecration we render. Our consecration must match the light that God has given us.</p><p>Individually, when we put everything on the altar, the fire comes. Between the light and the fire, there is the need of consecration. If consecration follows the light, immediately there is fire. The stronger the consecration, the easier it is for the fire to start. Once the fire starts, others will catch it easily. If our next-door neighbor's house is on fire, it is easy for ours to catch fire. This fire will turn even hard wood into hot flames. If a person tries to fan a spark before it develops into a flame, the fire will be killed. However, the more rubbing and friction there is, the easier it is to catch a fire. This is the reason we have to rub each other until we are red-hot. The hotter we become, the more fire there will be. If we are cold, fanning will only quench the fire; it will not build the fire.</p><p>No one should seek for fire. As long as we have enough consecration and as long as we have enough friction, we will have the fire. If the spiritual pathway is too easy and relaxed, the fire of the gospel will be extinguished. The more we go on in the spiritual pathway, the more we should not consider ourselves as experienced or matured. If we think that we have consecrated enough, we will quench the fire on the altar. In the Old Testament God commanded that the fire on the altar must not go out day or night (Lev. 6:12-13). The entire life of a Christian, from the time he first believes to the time he goes to the Lord, must be accompanied by fire.</p><p>In Mark 8:35 the Lord said, "Whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel's...." This is not only for the Lord's sake but also for the gospel's sake. Paul was an apostle who was consecrated for the gospel's sake. He said, "And I do all things for the sake of the gospel that I may become a fellow partaker of it" (1 Cor. 9:23). The more he advanced in his spiritual life and the deeper his life took root, the more the fire of the gospel burned in him. Paul said that he was a called apostle separated unto the gospel of God (Rom. 1:1). The gospel not only includes saving sinners from hell, but every aspect of God's gospel, including salvation, sanctification, justification, the church, etc. The gospel covers a wide scope. Paul said that he was the foremost among sinners, yet he was called to be a pattern to other believers (1 Tim. 1:16). He also said that he was less than the least of all saints, yet he received grace to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel (Eph. 3:8). These verses show us that the Lord has called us for the gospel.</p><p>I have to shout aloud that we need to bring in a gospel spirit. This is the only way for the brothers and sisters to go on. Unless we have this spirit, our preaching will be like children playing with toys. In Foochow the fire of the gospel has been ignited. The church not only must preach the gospel but must touch the gospel spirit. In order to touch the gospel spirit, the only way is for us to have a fresh consecration.</p><p>The author of the book Seen and Heard, Mr. M'Kendrick, was a miner. He did not even attend an elementary school, but he was a totally consecrated person. Within him was the gospel fire. His heart was filled with a burning zeal for saving souls. Once, while he was on the platform, he could not utter a word. As he looked around at the unsaved people sitting before him, he began to cry, and tears rolled down his cheeks like torrents. In the end he only shouted a word or two. God's Spirit filled the entire congregation. All were convicted of their sin and waywardness. We should not be afraid of shouting. John the Baptist shouted in the Gospels. The Lord Jesus also shouted. The apostles shouted many times in Acts. Although Brother M'Kendrick did not have much education or gift, he had the gospel spirit, and countless numbers of people were saved through him.</p><p>A young person may not have the gift of Moody, Finney, or Spurgeon, but he can learn to be a M'Kendrick. A young brother may not necessarily have the gift of the gospel, but he must have the spirit of the gospel. In church history God raises up great evangelists only once in a long while. But every lover of the Lord should and must have a gospel spirit.</p><p>On the one hand, we should increase our gospel preaching. On the other hand, we should increase our consecration. Our consecration cannot stop. Once we stop our consecration, the spirit of the gospel will stop. In order to recover the gospel, we have to recover consecration. Both things have to be absolute in us. Our foolishness lies in the misconception that we are behind the early church only in the power of the gospel; actually, our consecration comes far behind the early disciples as well. May the fire of God's gospel continue to burn in us. May it ignite you and me first. May the church not become a hindrance to the world's salvation, but a channel through which the Lord is dispensed to the world.</p>
