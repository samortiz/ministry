   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD NOT TOLERATING MIXTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden is that we would see that religion is in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The brothers in Jerusalem and the apostle Paul tolerated it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were trying to calm the situation, but the Lord allowed a riot to rise up against Paul, which resulted in his arrest before he completed the purification v. 27 . The Lord did not allow him to be purified in that way, for that was not a purification but a contamination.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s history was wonderful, but in this matter he was contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was weakened by the religious concept in Jerusalem, but the Lord did not tolerate it and sent him far away from Jerusalem to a prison in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There Paul was truly purified and later wrote the Epistles to the Ephesians, Timothy, and Titus, Epistles of purification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church in Jerusalem became a mixture of the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy, a mixture of the law and of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the Lord could not tolerate this mixture, He sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Christians as well as the Jews suffered persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was another purification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nevertheless, after the Lord purified the church through persecution, the church went back to mixture with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The religious element is still mixed with the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to see the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church in Jerusalem was built in a new way with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and with the Triune God but it eventually became a mixture with religion, with the law and Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout church history, mixture has come in again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the 1500s Martin Luther was used by the Lord to recover the truth of justification by faith, but Luther did not help the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, it was through him that the state churches came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Afterward, the private churches were formed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The recovery of the proper church life did not begin until the 1700s with Zinzendorf and the Moravian brethren in Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A further recovery of the church life occurred a hundred years later, in the late 1820s, when the Lord raised up the British Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was a further step in the recovery of the church practice, but it was eventually damaged through division caused by doctrinal concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then the Lord was forced to go to China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first meeting of a local church in China took place in Foochow in 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Throughout the years the Lord has shown us more of the proper way to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because this present step of recovery stands on the shoulders of the previous steps, the light is clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE CHURCH TODAY FACING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION AND MIXTURE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be watchful that mixture would not come into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1962 I was commissioned by the Lord to sound the trumpet of His recovery in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time I was advised by some co-workers not to teach concerning the local church, but I was burdened by the Lord to teach this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now many years later, local church has become a popular term in the Christian market, appearing in radio broadcasts and printed materials.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Various groups even claim to be local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, some opposed our teaching concerning the practice of the church life; then others received it and mixed it with denominational practices.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even some among us have begun to compromise with religious mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If Peter and the other apostles could compromise, it is possible that we too could err in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE LORD NEEDING TO HAVE A FRESH START TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am sorrowful to see the situation today of mixture, compromise, and toleration.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the Lord will never change; rather, He will leave the old generation and have a fresh start with a group of young people, just as He did in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord was not able to use the Pharisees, Sadducees, or even good ones like Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord left them in Jerusalem and spent three and a half years to train some young fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today the Lord will train a group of young people and send them out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The most crucial areas of the earth today are Europe and the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I believe that the United States is today s Galilee, and Europe is today s Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord will use the United States to train a group of young people and then send them to Europe, especially to the college campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord will gain the United States and Europe by capturing and training a group of young people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must say no to mixture, compromise, and toleration.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The United States and Europe are full of superstition, tradition, and organized religion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to see that the Lord has no way with today s religion, just as He had no way with Judaism, the old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord dropped Judaism, and He will also drop today s religion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that many saints from the United States will migrate to Europe and Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who stay in the United States need to carry out three main functions: gain students on the college campuses, pray for those who migrate, and supply the sent ones materially.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who migrate may go as students, enrolling in a master s program to study the language of the country they are in. If some young ones have a burden for Europe, they may study French or German as an undergraduate in the United States and then enroll in a master s program in France or Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While they are studying, they can contact their fellow students.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They should not care for gaining a large number.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the years that it takes to earn a master s degree, they may gain several of their classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That group will become a nucleus for the Lord to raise up a church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way the Lord can raise up churches in every country in Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>THREE WAYS TO BE PREPARED</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>TO BE SENT OUT BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today the young people need to prepare themselves in three ways to go either to Europe or to a college campus in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First, they need to learn languages.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I encourage all the young people to learn foreign languages.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the present time European languages are the most useful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The young ones need to learn the languages thoroughly, learning the grammar, pronunciation, and composition until they are able to speak fluently, translate, and compose.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When they migrate to a country, they should already be able to express themselves clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The young people also need to learn human history in order to understand the national disposition and character of the people whom they contact.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I encourage the young people to go to Europe, not to work but to enroll in school to master the language.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>While studying, they can contact local young people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After three years, they will have mastered the language and gained a number of young companions to form a nucleus of believers to gain the country.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Second, the young people need to gain the experiences in the church life to learn how to care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In this way they will be prepared to take the lead and be responsible ones in the churches that are raised up where they go.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Third, the young people need to learn all the truths the truths concerning such matters as the gospel, the church, the kingdom, life, and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They need to read and study all the books that we publish in order to be fully instructed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then, when they go out, they can teach the truth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The young people need to be prepared in these three ways learning languages, gaining the church life experience, and learning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way the Lord will be able to prepare His bride.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Soon every European country and every major campus in the United States will have a nucleus as a small army fighting the battle and raising up new churches.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We all need to pray and stand with those who go out.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Otherwise, it will be difficult to overcome the religious mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord needs a new current to flow Himself out.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We must give the Lord a way to have this new current.</S>
