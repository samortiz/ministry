   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE THE CHURCH THE FAILURES IN THE CHURCHES 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With this message we shall begin to consider the failures in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE FAILURES IN THE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible there is a record not only of the positive things concerning the church but also a record of the failures in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are no failures in the universal church; however, there are failures in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the failures come out of one source, and this source is Satan, who instigates the weak saints to cause all kinds of local problems.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The universal church is heavenly, holy, and even divine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But when the universal church reaches a certain locality to be expressed in a local church, the church in that locality may become contaminated and polluted by certain local customs, practices, and philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the failures are not in the universal church but in the local churches which have been contaminated by the things of their localities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, in the New Testament there is not only a clear vision of the pure, holy, heavenly, and divine church but also a record of all the failures in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. Hypocrisy</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first failure in the churches was that of hypocrisy seen in the case of Ananias and Sapphira Acts 5:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hypocrisy is a matter of pretending to be somebody in order to get a name that we may have vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is altogether related to ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ambition, therefore, is the seed of the failures in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all should condemn ambition and not seek to get a name for ourselves in order to have vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ananias and his wife Sapphira were seeking a position.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They wanted to be somebody and to have a name so that they could enjoy vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was the cause of their hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They did not offer everything to the church for the Lord's sake but pretended to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, although they were saved persons, they were condemned and suffered physical death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Letting Satan Fill the Heart</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Acts 5:1-11 indicates that two persons were making their residence in Ananias and Sapphira.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, the Spirit was no doubt dwelling in them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because they were saved, the Holy Spirit had taken up His residence within them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, Satan was dwelling in them, for he had filled their hearts to lie to the Spirit v. 3 . Satan was not merely outside them but was in their hearts deceiving them and seducing them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How could Satan have such ground within Ananias and Sapphira?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan had this ground because of their ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The ground in Ananias and Sapphira that was the basis for Satan's deception of them was their desire to have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They wanted to have the reputation of having sold everything for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of their ambition, they formed a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They sold a piece of property, kept some of the proceeds for themselves, and then brought a certain part and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan is not far from us, and we need to be careful lest we be deceived by him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would avoid Satan's deception, we must reject, condemn, and abandon the position to be somebody in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we have the thought of being somebody in the church life, Satan has the ground to deceive us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ananias and Sapphira had the ambition to be somebody in the church; they had the ambition to have a name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of their ambition they were deceived, and that deception brought them into death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the record indicates, both Ananias and Sapphira died physically.</S>
