   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT AS OUR PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past messages we have covered many crucial aspects of the wonderful, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But one deeper aspect remains to be touched, an aspect hidden in the New Testament revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 3:16 Paul prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened in our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse Paul unexpectedly uses a strange but particular term: the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This term is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here Paul does not speak of the spirit or of any other organ; he says that our inner man needs to be strengthened so that Christ may make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to read Ephesians 3:16 and 17 very attentively, noticing the matter of the inner man and then the matter of Christ's making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Within us we have an inner man, which we did not have before we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SOUL BEING THE PERSONALITY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Human beings have their being, or their man, in their soul, not in their body or in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, the Bible often refers to man as a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, Exodus 1:5 says that "all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls," and Acts 2:41, speaking of those baptized on the day of Pentecost, says that "there were added unto them about three thousand souls."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Bible, a person is a soul because his being, his man, is in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible reveals that man is a tripartite being, composed of the spirit within, the body without, and the soul between the spirit and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The soul is the being, for a person's personality is in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In other words, human life is in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The body is an organ to contact the outward world, and the spirit is an organ to contact the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, a human being, a person, with his personality in his soul, has both a body and a spirit as organs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Neither the body nor the spirit is his personality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that the personality of a human being is neither in the body nor in the spirit, but in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the soul, and neither the body nor the spirit, is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before we were regenerated, our body was our outward organ and our spirit was our inward organ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being an inward organ, the spirit has no personality in it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SPIRIT BECOMING THE INNER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and were regenerated, Christ as life entered into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Prior to this, there was no life in our spirit, for the spirit was merely an organ without life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our human life was not in our spirit; it was in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A human being is in the soul; that is, the soul is the human being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when we were regenerated, Christ came into our spirit to be life there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This caused our spirit to no longer be an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The coming of Christ into our spirit makes our spirit a new being, which the Apostle Paul called the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Formerly, our spirit was merely an organ, and there was no man, no personality, in it because there was no life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But by coming into our spirit, Christ has made it a being with life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now in our spirit we have another being, the new being, the inner man.</S>
