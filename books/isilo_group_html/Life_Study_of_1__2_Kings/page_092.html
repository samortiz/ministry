THE HEALING OF JEHOVAH</H2><P>Second Kings 20:1-11 tells us about Jehovah's healing of Hezekiah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Hezekiah Becoming Mortally Ill</H2><P>Hezekiah became mortally ill, and Jehovah told him through Isaiah the prophet that he was about to die (v. 1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Hezekiah Praying to Jehovah</H2><P>Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah. Through Isaiah the prophet Jehovah told Hezekiah that He would heal him, add to his life fifteen years, and deliver him and Jerusalem from the king of Assyria for His own sake and for the sake of David His servant (vv. 2-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Isaiah Recovering Hezekiah</H2><P>Isaiah recovered Hezekiah with a cake of figs (v. 7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Hezekiah Wanting a Sign</H2><P>Hezekiah wanted a sign, and Jehovah gave him a sign&#151;the shadow which had descended on the steps of Ahaz went backward ten steps (vv. 8-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE FAILURE OF HEZEKIAH</H2><P>In verses 12 through 19 we see the failure of Hezekiah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The King of Babylon Sending<br>Letters and a Gift to Hezekiah</H2><P>The king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because of his recovery (v. 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Hezekiah Showing All His Treasury<br>and His Armory and Everything Found<br>among His Treasures</H2><P>Hezekiah showed the ones from Babylon all his treasury and his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that he did not show them (v. 13). His wanting to make a show offended God. God hates man's pride. Thus, we should never try to glorify ourselves. In the Lord's work we need to learn the lesson of trying our best to hide ourselves, concealing our masterpieces from the eyes of man. This will please God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Hezekiah Being Condemned by God<br>through His Prophet Isaiah</H2><P>Because of what Hezekiah did, he was condemned by God through His prophet Isaiah. Isaiah told him that the days were now coming when everything that was in his house and that his fathers had laid up as a treasure would be carried away to Babylon and nothing would be left. Isaiah went on to say that the Babylonians would take away some of Hezekiah's sons and make them eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon (vv. 14-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Hezekiah Answering<br>That the Word of Jehovah Was Good</H2><P>Hezekiah answered that the word of Jehovah was good and that it was good that there would be peace and truth (stability) in his days (v. 19). I am bothered by Hezekiah's answer, for it indicates that he was somewhat selfish, caring for himself but not for his descendants. This indicates that he was not that weighty in the matter of spirituality.</P><P>At this juncture we should note that the portion from 18:13&#151;20:19 is similar to Isaiah 36:1&#151;39:8, with the omission of the song of Hezekiah recorded in Isaiah 38:9-20. Concerning this I would ask you to consult messages nineteen and twenty in the Life-study of Isaiah, given from the angle of Hezekiah's spirituality.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Kings &nbsp; pg 92</div><br></body></html>
