   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WRONG PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If a Christian does not know the order of God's work, and if he gives up the work of evangelism to engage himself in social and political reforms, the result is not merely a matter of right or wrong, it is a dead-end street.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All the problems of today are caused by man being out of order.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is because man is evil that the system becomes evil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since man is evil, no system can be good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if he is able to set up a good system, his evil nature still does not change, and he can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are a number of philosophies which are lofty and logical, but under the hand of corrupted man, nothing can be achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if the man is right, it does not matter if the system is a little faulty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if the man is wrong, a good system is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first coming of Christ was for securing men.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without men He has no way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE PARABLE OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to look at one passage in the Scripture to see how Christ deals with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First we will look at the parable and then the explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 13:24-30 says, "Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where then did the tares come from?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And he said to them, An enemy has done this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and collect them?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But he said, No, lest while collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat gather into my barn."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again, read verses 36 to 40 of the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the parable of the tares of the field clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore just as the tares are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the consummation of the age."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE END OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord said that there will be an end to this world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What will happen at the end of the world?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please note verses 41 to 43.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will collect out of His kingdom all the stumblingblocks and those who practice lawlessness, and will cast them into the furnace of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THINGS THAT CAUSE STUMBLING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of the world the Lord will gather out of His kingdom all things that cause stumbling and those that cause iniquities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an excellent word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will abolish all that causes stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The racial problem causes stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It shall be taken out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The international power struggle is also a stumbling element.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It likewise will be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There will only be one kingdom: the kingdom of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There will not be any more international conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the stumbling problems such as class exploitation and ideological struggle will be plucked out.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THINGS THAT CAUSE INIQUITIES</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All that cause iniquities will also be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You will not find gambling tables or barrooms anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All channels that lead to sins will be wiped out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even if you want to sin, you will not be able to do so, for all the means for transgression will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this will happen only at Christ's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All these problems will be solved then.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At that time the kingdom of God will be inaugurated on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the saved ones will become the righteous ones because their sins have been taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>All these righteous ones will shine in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They will rule over His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Their presence will be as the sun, whose rays reach the farthest corner and whose power transpires throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But all this will be brought to pass only at Christ's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No wonder you will fail if you want to work for Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only in that day will the kingdom of the earth become the kingdom of Christ and His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When that day comes, not only will all social vices be swept away, but the book of Isaiah tells us that even the enmities in the animal kingdom will be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Children will be able to play with snakes, and lions will graze in the pastures like cows.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even the beastly nature within animals will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All this will be realized at the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>THE STORY OF A BRITISH POLITICIAN</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the last century, there was a British woman politician named Christobel Pankhurst.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She was the leader of the woman's suffrage movement.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Before the First World War, she tried everything she could to stop the war.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the craftiness and wickedness of the politicians of the day soon triggered the catastrophe.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She then tried her best to end the war.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But her efforts were in vain; the war came to an end only after four bitter years.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She thought that if she could lay her hand on power, she would be able to effect political reforms.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But in the end she was convinced that there was no honesty in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To be honest would never make one successful in the political arena.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>She began to lose faith in worldly systems.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>One day she was looking for some books in an old bookstore in London.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>From a pile she pulled out a small booklet written by a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It said that the world situation was going to worsen, and there was no chance of improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The final solution would come only when Christ comes back again.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>She was fully captured by its message.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>She wanted to know the price of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The owner, realizing that she was a famed politician, gave it to her as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The book was published a few decades before that time, and the author had long deceased.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But she realized that what the book mentioned about the world situation was absolutely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Other books merely discussed the outward appearance; this one exposed the root of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It said that the Lord Jesus came the first time to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The second time He comes, He will change the political systems.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The booklet also mentioned some prophecies in the Bible concerning the end of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Because of this book, she began to read the Bible and accepted Jesus Christ to be her Savior and King.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Later she resigned her political career and wrote some good books concerning the work of Christ and His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>WAITING FOR THE LORD'S COMING</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What we need today is to be proper Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We do not need to try to change the institutions or reform society.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>All of our hope rests in the coming of our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When He comes, all problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Today, we only seek after God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We wait for the coming of His Son, and we trust that in that day we will reign with Him in His glory.</S>
