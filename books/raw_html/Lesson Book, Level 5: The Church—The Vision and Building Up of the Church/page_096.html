Many Christians think that after they are saved initially, they simply wait to go to heaven. They have no idea that they were saved as members of the Body to build up the church. Some among us may think that we have nothing to worry about, because by His mercy, we are in the church. It is true that all of our sins have been forgiven. It is also true that we are in the practical local church life. Yet, we must labor diligently in building up the church. In this lesson we will address two of the most crucial matters concerning building up the church—increase and spread.<h2 class=head1>I. THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Need to Increase</h2><p>[The increase of the church is to impart Christ to others and make them a part of Christ. The branches of the Vine bear fruit by imparting the life of the Vine to others and making them a part of the Vine. If the branches of a vine do not bear fruit, there will be no increase of the vine. The fruit-bearing of the branches is the increase of the vine tree. So the increase of the church is by the fruit-bearing of all the members. All the members must bear fruit; otherwise, there will be no increase of the local church.<p>Today in Christianity, nearly everything is abnormal, even the preaching of the gospel. Christianity today depends upon the giant preachers with huge gospel campaigns, but this is not so in the Bible. In the Bible, especially in the gospel of John, the real gospel preaching is the fruit-bearing of every member.] [It is just like the Tree of Life in the New Jerusalem: it bears new fruits every month. This is the proper preaching of the gospel, and this is the increase of the church. It does not depend upon great preachers and large gospel campaigns. The normal daily life of the members of the church is simply to bear fruit; then there is the increase of the church.<p>The proper way to preach the gospel is to impart Christ into others as life. We should not trust in the great preachers; we have to trust in ourselves. Every member of the church is a branch to bear fruit. Consider the fruit tree. Every kind of fruit tree bears fruit at least once a year—this is a natural law. I do believe that as living members of the local church, we must bring at least one new convert a year to the Lord. Suppose a branch of the vine does not bear fruit year after year. What do they do with it? They prune it or cut it off. Every local church must encourage every member to bring at least one new convert to the Lord every year. Even to bring in ten or twelve a year is not too many, for that is simply like a cluster of grapes.<p>In the local church, we should be fruitful. Whenever we come to the church meeting, we must come with some new ones. Do not come to the meetings alone—that is not a glory; that is a shame! We need to come to the meetings with others for the increase of the local church.]
