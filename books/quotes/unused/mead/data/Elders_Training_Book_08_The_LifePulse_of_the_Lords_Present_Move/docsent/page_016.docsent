   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR HOME GATHERING 3 To prepare ourselves for the meeting 1 Cor 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Elders to labor in the Word 1 Tim 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE HOME MEETINGS AND THE BIG MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those whom we have observed who have practiced the home meetings may not have had much of the riches in life of Christ and the Spirit, yet they have gained people through the mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Human beings need a community.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even in a small town if there is no home gathering, it would be hard to have the proper communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Once you set up the home gatherings, you will attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Simply to set up big gatherings for the Christians to come together to listen to messages would not be sufficient to catch people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The home gatherings are centers to catch people for the proper communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church life is the best society because it is the best communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not consider taking another way besides the way of home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have been distracted for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The recovery was raised up by the Lord in the way of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Almost all the few hundred churches raised up in mainland China before I left there were raised up in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps the only exception was the one raised up by the saints meeting in a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first local church in Southern California was also raised up in a home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Samuel Chang s home on Third Street in Los Angeles was very much used and blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, we gradually forgot and gave up the way by which we were all raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was the reason that since October of 1984, I became so strong to come back to this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The churches on the island of Taiwan were also raised up in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though we had our halls, we still continued to have the small groups in the first six years of the church life there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However by October of 1984 they had nearly lost this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They mostly had the big gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Surely this is a backsliding, a repetition of the poor history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Throughout this long period of time all the churches have been practicing to pay their first attention and give the first love to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the saints were affected and influenced in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They lost their taste for the home gatherings because the big gatherings fit in with their natural concept and slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They did not need to exercise their spirit, but still preferred to talk about the world situation, home affairs, and their relatives, even until ten minutes before the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, they still came to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They had not finished their conversation, and even after coming to the meeting, they still continued their talk in their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Not only their spirit, but even their heart, their soul, and their mind, were altogether not there for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a great backsliding.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I dare not to cut off the big meetings because we still need a big meeting to take care of so many Sunday goers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today every nation has Sunday as a holiday.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many people consider that if you are going to be a Christian, you must go to church on Sunday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This has been a world-wide popular habit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, it is better to utilize this day and this habit, just as the Lord Jesus and the apostles utilized the way of going to the synagogues on the Sabbath Luke 4:15-16; Acts 9:20; 13:5, 14, 44; 14:1; 17:10; 18:26; 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord took this convenient opportunity to contact those poor sinners in the synagogues.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we may need a big meeting, especially on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In every locality, the church may have a big meeting on the Lord s Day to take care of the Sunday goers and all those who have the popular concept of coming to the church building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the way that we can get some people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, we should not mainly have the big meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That would be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To not have such a meeting would be a lack, but we should pay our primary attention to the home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our slogan should be Home meetings are first we give our first love, first attention, and best time to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must give the first of everything to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may need a big meeting on the Lord s Day to take care of the Sunday goers, the backsliding ones, and those with the concept from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will have a place at a certain time on Sunday that they could come to get some help.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For such a big meeting we need a good and able speaker to give a very sound and attracting message.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the proper way to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every church needs at least one or two capable speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They must have more than mere eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They must be capable in the riches of Christ, capable in the rich word of the Bible, and capable to present Christ in such a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such speakers must be very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They have to continually watch over the attendants in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may prepare a Sunday morning meeting with no consideration for the unbelievers and no intent to have the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, when you come to speak and see a number of new ones and unbelievers, you must be flexible in your message.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At least ten minutes must be given to speak concerning salvation and the Lord in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need such a capable speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need such a person or two persons in every church, especially in a church that has over two hundred people, yet we must still stress the home meetings.</S>
