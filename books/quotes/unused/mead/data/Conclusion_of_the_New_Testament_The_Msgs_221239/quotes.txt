[1]  The Failures in the Churches 1 Message Two Hundred Twenty-Two The Church
[2]  In 21:23b-24 we have the requirement James and the other elders made of Paul.
[3]  "Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law."
[4]  In this message we shall consider further the failures in the churches.
[5]  G. Being Puffed Up on Behalf of One Gifted Person against Another unto Strife and Divisions
[6]  We read of another failure in the churches in 1 Corinthians 6:6.
[7]  K. Partaking of the Table of the Lord and of the Table of the Demons
[8]  First Corinthians 10:21 says, "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons."
[9]  Another failure is that of abusing the gift of tongue-speaking 1 Cor 14:19-20, 23 .
[10]  Paul restricted the use of the gift of tongue-speaking in the meetings, saying, "In the church I would rather speak five words with my mind that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue" v. 19 . This shows that speaking in intelligible words for the building up of the church, and not tongue-speaking, is needed in the church meetings.
[11]  The philosophy and empty deceit in 2:8 are not only according to the tradition of men but also according to the elements of the world, Here and in Colossians 2:20 and Galatians 4:3 the expression "the elements of the world" does not refer to substances; rather, it refers to the rudimentary teachings of both Jews and Gentiles, teachings that consist of ritualistic observances in meats, drinks, washings, and asceticism.
[12]  In the eyes of Paul, the traditions of men were merely elementary principles.
[13]  B. Teaching Things Different from the Economy of God Taught by the Apostle, Resulting in Turning Away from the Apostle's Teaching
[14]  Another aspect of the degradation of the church was the teaching of things different from the economy of God taught by the apostle, resulting in turning away from the apostle's teaching.
[15]  C. Supposing Godliness to Be a Means of Gain
[16]  In 1 Timothy 6:5b Paul speaks of those who suppose "godliness to be a means of gain."
[17]  Verse 26 says that "there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins" for those who sin willfully.
[18]  If the Hebrew believers had forsaken the church and returned to Judaism, there would have remained no sacrifice for sin in the economy of God, for all the sacrifices of the old covenant have been altogether replaced by the one sacrifice of Christ.
[19]  Since Christ has once for all offered Himself as the sacrifice for our sins Heb 7:27; 10:10, 12 , the sacrifice for sin has ceased Heb 10:2 , having been taken away by Christ Heb 10:9 .
[20]  J. False Teachers Bringing In Destructive Heresies, Even Denying the Master Who Bought Them, and Following the Way of Balaam Who Loved the Wages of Unrighteousness
[21]  Second Peter 2:1 says, "There arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction."
[22]  L. Not Confessing That Jesus Christ Has Come in the Flesh
[23]  First John 4:1 says, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are out of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
[24]  In verse 2 John goes on to say, "In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God."
[25]  A false Christ is one who pretends deceivingly to be the Christ, whereas an antichrist is one who denies Christ's deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God 1 John 2:22 , not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit.
[26]  Second John 9 says, "Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, this one has both the Father and the Son."
[27]  Literally, the Greek word translated "goes beyond" means to lead forward in a negative sense , that is, to go further than what is right, to advance beyond the limit of orthodox teaching concerning Christ.
[28]  Third John 9 and 10 say, "I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us.
[29]  Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, babbling against us with evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he receive the brothers, and those intending to do so he forbids and casts them out of the church."
[30]  In this message we shall consider the remaining aspects of the degradation of the church.
[31]  The church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:23 is a matter of life; as the new man Eph 2:15 , it is a matter of the person of Christ; and as the bride of Christ John 3:29 , it is a matter of love.
[32]  The first epistle to the Ephesians tells us that for the church life we need to be strengthened in our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God Eph 3:16-19 ; and that it is for the church life that grace is with all them who love the Lord Jesus Eph 6:24 .
[33]  R. Becoming in Union with the World Where Satan's Throne Is
[34]  During the first three centuries, the church suffered a great deal as the Roman government tried its best to damage her.
[35]  U. Tolerating the Woman Jezebel, Who Calls Herself a Prophetess, to Teach and Lead the Lord's Slaves Astray to Commit Fornication and to Eat Idol Sacrifices, and to Teach the Deep Things of Satan
[36]  V. Having a Name of Being Living but Actually Being Dead
[37]  Another aspect of the degradation of the church is that of having a name of being living but actually being dead.
[38]  In Revelation 3:1 the Lord says, "I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead."
[39]  Here we see that the church had a name of being living, but the Lord says that she was dead.
[40]  B. Having Overcome the World through Faith in the Son of God
[41]  The overcomers in the church have overcome the world through faith in the Son of God.
[42]  First John 5:4 and 5 say, "Because everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which overcame the world our faith.
[43]  First John 2:13 and 14 speak of the overcoming of the evil one.
[44]  E. Having Overcome All the Degradations of the Degraded Churches
[45]  The overcomers have overcome all the degradations of the degraded churches spoken of in Revelation 2:4, 6, 13, 14, 15, 20, 24; 3:1,15, 20a, and 17:5.
[46]  During the degradation and desolation of the church, in order to maintain and continue the church's testimony concerning Christ that the church may be recovered to her original state, the need to have the overcomers is a pressing matter, and it is something of the Lord's desire.
[47]  In Revelation 2:20 the Lord Jesus says, "I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices."
[48]  This woman is the same as the one prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, the woman who added leaven signifying evil, heretical, and pagan things into the fine flour signifying Christ as the meal offering for the satisfaction of God and man .
[49]  Revelation 3:1 says, "To the messenger of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead."
[50]  In this message we shall cover four aspects of the overcomers in the church: the dead overcomers, the living overcomers, the overcomers as the bride at the marriage feast of Christ and in the millennium, and the overcomers as the armies in heaven fighting with the coming Christ against Antichrist and his armies.
[51]  To Be Resurrected and Raptured to the Throne of God before the Great Tribulation
[52]  H. To Be the Bride at the Marriage Feast of Christ and in the Millennium
[53]  This means that at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming believers.
[54]  We shall see that the overcomers will reign with Christ and be priests of God and Christ in the millennium, that they will inherit the kingdom of Christ and of God to enter the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, and that they will be glorified with Christ.
[55]  In Revelation 2:10b the Lord Jesus says, "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life."
[56]  In Galatians 5:21 Paul, referring to the works of the flesh, says, "Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
[57]  The inheritance of the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers.
[58]  The eternal kingdom in 2 Peter 1:11 refers to the kingdom of God given to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Dan 7:13-14 , which will be manifested at His coming back Luke 19:11-12 .
[59]  In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the overcomers in the church.
[60]  O. To Participate in the Feast of the Kingdom of the Heavens
[61]  In this verse the Lord Jesus says, "I say to you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall recline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens."
[62]  Luke 14:14 says, "You will be blessed, because they do not have anything with which to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous."
[63]  This resurrection is the resurrection of life John 5:29; Rev 20:4-6 , when God will reward the saints Rev 11:18 at the Lord's return 1 Cor 4:5 .
[64]  In order to receive the reward in the coming age, we need to enjoy Christ faithfully in this age.
[65]  Here we see that in His wisdom God has made the enjoyment of Christ in the coming age a reward for the faithful ones, the ones who enjoy Christ faithfully in this age.
[66]  Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work Eph 2:8-9 , whereas the kingdom reward is for our work after we are saved.
[67]  We may not receive the kingdom reward even though we are saved, because we are void of the work which the Lord would approve 1 Cor 3:15 .
[68]  In Hebrews 10:35 the Hebrew believers in particular are charged not to miss the kingdom reward the coming Sabbath rest Heb 4:9 , the enjoyment of Christ and the reign with Christ in the coming age.
[69]  In the foregoing messages we saw the failures in the churches, the degradation of the church, and the overcomers in the church.
[70]  In this message we shall begin to consider the vital matter of the recovery of the church.
[71]  In the Old Testament God first gained a people through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[72]  Eventually, that people became the nation of Israel, which was called a kingdom of priests Exo 19:6 .
[73]  Back to Jerusalem, the God-ordained Unique Ground, with all the Vessels of the Temple of God Which Had Been Captured to Babylon
[74]  The recovery of the children of Israel was not only from Babylon but back to Jerusalem, the God-ordained unique ground.
[75]  In the foregoing message we saw that the recovery of the church is typified by the return of the children of Israel from their captivity.
[76]  In this message we shall see that the recovery of the church is indicated in the New Testament.
[77]  Not to Contact Those Who Do Not Abide in the Teaching of Christ the Teaching concerning Christ's Deity and Incarnation by Divine Conception
[78]  The Greek word for begotten in Matthew 1:20 is gennao.
[79]  In Matthew 1:2-16 the Greek word is used thirty-eight times and is translated as "begot."
[80]  Verse 16 says, "And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
[81]  THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO THE CHURCH THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH 3
[82]  We have seen that the recovery of the church is typified by the return of the children of Israel from their captivity and that it is indicated in some of the later New Testament writings.
[83]  Now we shall go on to see what it means for the church to be recovered.
[84]  The Bible is not at either of these extremes; it stands in the center, testifying the twofoldness of the truth of the Trinity.
[85]  Anyone who denies that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh denies that He was conceived of the Holy Spirit.
[86]  Furthermore, anyone who rejects Jesus Christ coming in the flesh rejects His humanity and His human living.
[87]  Therefore, to deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is to deny His holy conception, His incarnation, His birth, His humanity, His human living, and also His redemption.
[88]  In 1 Corinthians 15:12 Paul refers to the preaching that Christ has been raised from among the dead.
[89]  This indicates clearly that the apostles preached the resurrection of Christ.
[90]  We have seen that the church needs to be recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truths concerning the person of the Triune God and the person and work of Christ.
[91]  The next matter we shall see is that we need to be brought back to the unique and pure ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ with its truths concerning the New Testament faith and God's economy, the person and work of Christ, the person and the dispensing of the Triune God, the church, the Body of Christ, the corporate Christ, and the universal and local aspects of the church.
[92]  This is God's household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ 1 Tim 3:15 .
[93]  Concerning the person and work of Christ, we must preach that Christ is God incarnated to be a God-man, that He is both divine and human.
[94]  The Person and the Dispensing of the Triune God
[95]  The recovery of the church also requires that we be recovered to the truth concerning the person and the dispensing of the Triune God.
[96]  By the Lord's mercy we have been enlightened to see that in the New Testament economy of God there is the divine, triune Person for the dispensing of Himself into His chosen people to be their life, life supply, and everything.
[97]  In this message we shall see that this recovery also involves the truth concerning the church, the Body of Christ, the corporate Christ, and the universal and local aspects of the church.
[98]  Today the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, and in the future the church will be manifested with Christ in glory Col 3:3-4 .
[99]  e. The Universal and Local Aspects of the Church
[100]  This aspect of the church is revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16:18, where He says, "On this rock I will build My church."
[101]  In 16:18 the Lord says that He will build His church upon "this rock," which refers not only to Christ Himself but also to the revelation of Christ.
[102]  In Ephesians 4:13 Paul goes on to say, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
[103]  The oneness of the Spirit in Ephesians 4:3 is the oneness of the divine life in reality, whereas the oneness in verse 13 is the oneness of our living in practicality.
[104]  The building up of the Body of Christ is a matter of constitution.
[105]  The Body is an organic entity constituted of the element of the processed Triune God.
[106]  Concerning the church as the temple of God, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3:16 and 17, "Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[107]  In verse 16 "a temple of God" refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, whereas "the temple of God" in verse 17 refers to all the believers universally.
[108]  Having considered the recovery of the church, we shall begin in this message to cover the stages of the church.
[109]  Because the church in Ephesus left the first love toward the Lord, it lost the enjoyment of the tree of life Rev 2:7 .
[110]  It was God's original intention that man should eat of the tree of life Gen 2:9, 16 .
[111]  Due to the fall, the tree of life was closed to man Gen 3:22-24 .
[112]  Through the redemption of Christ, the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again Heb 10:19-20 .
[113]  In Revelation 2:13 the Lord Jesus said to the church in Pergamos, "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is."
[114]  a. To Be Given to Eat the Hidden Manna
[115]  In 2:17b the Lord says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give of the hidden manna."
[116]  The open manna was for the enjoyment of the Lord's people in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers who overcome the degradation of the worldly church.
[117]  While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply.
[118]  The overcomers, the rest in Thyatira, do not have Jezebel's teaching v. 24 , have not known the deep things of Satan, hold fast the Lord's testimony until He comes v. 25 , and keep the Lord's works until the end. "My works" in verse 26 refers to the things the Lord has accomplished and is doing, such as His crucifixion, resurrection, and intercession, in contrast to the works of the apostate church under the influence of Satan. a. To Be Given Authority over the Nations and to Shepherd Them with an Iron Rod
[119]  As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers who were raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century.
[120]  As the One who has the key of David and who opens and no one shall shut v. 7 , the Lord has given the recovered church "an open door which no one can shut." Since the recovery of the proper church life began, in the early part of the nineteenth century, until now, a door has always been wide open to the Lord's recovery.
[121]  In 3:12a the Lord says, "He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore."
[122]  In 3:12b the Lord goes on to say concerning the overcomer, "I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name."
[123]  In verse 17 the Lord continues, "Because you say, I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked."
[124]  The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 not only signify prophetically the progress of the church in seven stages but also symbolize the seven kinds of churches in church history: the initial church, the suffering church, the worldly church, the apostate church, the reformed church, the recovered church, and the degraded recovered church.
[125]  In this message we shall consider the consummation of the church.
[126]  The members of the church are those who were fallen sinners and who have been saved by the grace of God Eph 2:8 through their God-given and God-allotted faith 2 Pet 1:1 , which has brought them into an organic union with the Triune God in Christ 1 Cor 6:17 .
[127]  Based upon this, the members of the church have been regenerated in their spirit by the Spirit of God John 3:6 to be the children of God unto the divine sonship John 1:12-13; Rom 8:16 and to be the members of Christ Eph 5:30 unto His stature Eph 4:13 to be His fullness Eph 1:23 .
[128]  D. All the Regenerated and Perfected Believers of the New Testament as Members of the Church, Represented by the Twelve Apostles, Will Be the Components of the New Jerusalem, Which Is the Church's Ultimate Consummation
[129]  God's intention is that the church will consummate in the New Jerusalem.
[130]  This means that the church must grow and be built up in the enjoyment of the eternal, divine life, the life of the processed and consummated Triune God; that the church must grow and be built up in experiencing the mingling of the believers with the Triune God in the way of His dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the processed and consummated divine Trinity; and that the church must grow and be built up in the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in His manifestation.
