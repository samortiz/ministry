<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE BLIND</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 9:1-11, 35-41; 10:26-29; Acts 26:18; 2 Cor. 4:4</h1>
<p>John 9:1-11 and 35-41 say, &ldquo;As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth. And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind? Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but he was born so, that the works of God might be manifested in him. We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world. When He had said this, He spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay, and He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is interpreted, Sent). He went therefore and washed and came away seeing. The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg? Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am the one. They said then to him, How then were your eyes opened? He answered, The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. I went therefore and washed, and I received my sight...Jesus...found him and said, Do you believe into the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him? Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and He is the One speaking with you. And he said, Lord, I believe; and he worshipped Him. And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind. Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, We are not blind also, are we? Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would not have sin; but now that you say, We see; your sin remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John 10:26-29 says, &ldquo;You do not believe, because you are not of My sheep. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acts 26:18 says, &ldquo;To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 4:4 says, &ldquo;In whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John 9 presents the seventh kind of people whom the Lord Jesus contacted on the earth, the blind. On the one hand, the eight kinds of people whom the Lord Jesus contacted refer to eight different kinds of people in humanity. On the other hand, these eight conditions can be found in every person. The first five kinds of people are one group, and the last three kinds of people are another group. The first five kinds of people are the moral, the immoral, the impotent, the hungry, and the thirsty. The last three kinds of people are the sinful, the blind, and the dead. The five conditions of the first group show that man needs the life of the Lord Jesus for regeneration, satisfaction, and strengthening. The three conditions of the second group show that man needs the Lord&rsquo;s life to resolve three great problems: sins, blindness, and death. Every person has these three problems. In the preceding chapter we have seen how the life of the Lord Jesus solves the problem of sins. In this chapter we will see how the life of the Lord Jesus solves the problem of blindness, the inability to see.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BEING BORN BLIND</h2>
<p>In John 9 the Lord Jesus met a man who was blind from birth. According to verses 39 through 41, the spiritual significance of being born blind is that man has no knowledge of God or of spiritual things from his birth. Blindness is the inability to see, the losing of one&rsquo;s sight. Everyone can see with their physical eyes from birth, but man&rsquo;s inward eyes are blind and unable to see God and spiritual things. The Lord Jesus said that this was the condition of the Pharisees. Several matters demonstrate that man is born blind.</p>
<p>Man is born blind, because he does not know God. Before we were saved, we may have said that there is no God. However, it is not that there is no God but that we could not see God due to our blindness. Man is born blind, because he does not understand the meaning of the universe. He does not know how the universe came into existence, the condition of the universe, or what will be the end of the universe.</p>
<p>Man is born blind, because he does not know his origin, course, or destination. Man does not know where he came from, where he is today, or where he is going. This is a matter of being blind. People think that they know many things. Some have academic degrees; they know philosophy, science, and principles and laws. However, they do not know their origin, their present condition, or their destination. This proves that man is blind; he cannot see his actual condition. He does not know the meaning of his human life, and he does not know what his relationship is with God.</p>
<p>Man is born blind, because he is ignorant of the mysteries of God. Spiritual matters, such as God&rsquo;s plan of salvation, His incarnation and life on earth, His desire to be man&rsquo;s life and to be mingled and joined with man, are beyond human comprehension.</p>
<p>Man is born blind, because the Holy Bible is foreign to man. The Bible is God&rsquo;s revelation. It makes known God&rsquo;s intention. However, a person cannot understand the Bible before he is saved, because the eyes of his heart are blind.</p>
<p>There are three necessary conditions in order to see an object. If we want to read a book, for example, we must open it. Without opening the book, we cannot see the printed words. This opening is a &ldquo;revealing.&rdquo; To reveal an object is to remove the veil in order for us to see it. However, a mere opening is not sufficient. Even though a book is opened, we will be unable to see the printed words if it is dark. Hence, we need light to shine upon the page so that we may see. This is the second condition. The third condition is that our eyes must be opened to see. If we do not have our sight, we will not be able to see. Therefore, in order to see something, there should be an opening, light, and vision. These three conditions result in seeing.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to spiritual seeing. In order for us to see the true meaning of a spiritual matter, we first need the revelation of the Bible. Second, we need the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. God sends the Holy Spirit to enlighten us and guide us to understand the truth. Third, we need spiritual eyes. When we have these three conditions, we can understand spiritual things.</p>
<p>God has given us the Bible, and He reveals every spiritual matter to us through the Bible. In the Bible God has revealed His purpose, the meaning of the universe, the meaning of man, the relationship between God and the universe, the relationship between God and man, man&rsquo;s condition, man&rsquo;s destination, the way for man to receive God&rsquo;s salvation, how man can be accepted by God, how to be in God&rsquo;s will, and how to be mingled and united with God. All these matters are explained in the Bible. Furthermore, the Spirit operates to enlighten man. When a person reads the Bible, the Spirit is there to shine in him. However, most people still cannot understand the Bible, nor can they see the spiritual matters contained in the Bible, because they lack spiritual eyes. Man has the Bible, and the Spirit is working, but man still cannot see spiritual things, because he is blind.</p>
<p>Man is not only blind inwardly; he is born blind. The representative in John 9 was blind from birth. This means that man&rsquo;s inner blindness is a matter of birth, a condition by nature; it is not a matter of sin. Therefore, when the disciples asked, &ldquo;Who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?&rdquo; the Lord Jesus answered, &ldquo;Neither has this man sinned nor his parents&rdquo; (vv. 2-3). Blindness is not a matter of sin but a matter of nature. Therefore, regardless of whether someone has sinned, regardless of whether he has committed many sins or few sins, regardless of whether he is bad or good, and regardless of whether he is a robber, a prostitute, a gentleman, or an upright person, he is born blind inwardly and is unable to see by nature.</p>
<p>In verse 3 the Lord spoke of the works of God being manifested in him. This means that man is blind from birth concerning spiritual matters because he is short of God&rsquo;s work. Regardless of whether someone is good or bad, his inner eyes cannot be opened if God has not worked in him. Without the Lord Jesus working in him, a noble gentleman with the highest morality is as blind inwardly as the most evil person. An evil and wicked person does not know God, and the most moral person likewise cannot understand God, because man is blind from birth and does not know God by nature. Hence, man needs God to work and open his inner eyes so that he can see.</p>
<p>The natural man does not and cannot understand the things of God, because man is blind. We should never think that being intelligent, wise, noble, or moral enables us to see the things of God. It is possible to have a thorough understanding of the world, human relationships, intellectual matters, international affairs, and the world&rsquo;s situation but still be blind and ignorant concerning the things of God.</p>
<p>Someone who is blind from birth has never seen light. A blind man, therefore, is in darkness. Likewise, the Bible, the church, many preachers, and many spiritual publications are spiritual lights that can enable people to comprehend the things of God. Many people, however, still cannot understand or see spiritual things. This proves that man, being blind from birth, is in complete darkness.</p>
<p>Someone who is born blind is also poor. The Gospel of John says that the blind man was a beggar (v. 8); he was very poor. Revelation 3:17 and 18 show that poverty is connected to blindness. Spiritually speaking, a blind person is poor. Someone who cannot comprehend spiritual things and who does not know God is spiritually destitute. Someone may be rich in the knowledge of the world and may have accumulated earthly riches; however, when we discuss spiritual things with him, we sense that he is a beggar who has nothing spiritually.</p>
<p>People are poor in spiritual things because their eyes are not open. Such people have a particular need. They need their eyes to be opened so that they can see. Spiritually speaking, nothing is more crucial than having one&rsquo;s eyes opened. When the Lord Jesus sent Paul, His disciple, to go forth and preach the gospel, He first charged Paul &ldquo;to open their eyes,&rdquo; and then &ldquo;to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me&rdquo; (Acts 26:18). Turning from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance is based on one&rsquo;s eyes being opened. The opening of man&rsquo;s eyes is the basis of all spiritual matters. The blind are unable to understand spiritual things, and they cannot receive them. When someone sees a spiritual matter, he has received it.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
