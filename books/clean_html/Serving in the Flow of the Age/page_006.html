<h2 class="head1">SIMPLY SUPPLYING LIFE<br />
AND NOT CONDEMNING OR CHANGING OTHERS</h2>
<p>Today a locality that is supplied and blessed by the Lord cannot remain hidden, because transportation and communications are so developed and extensive. Gradually, the whole Body will know what a local church has gained, and its supply will reach the whole Body. When the churches gather together for fellowship, we should just receive the fellowship, and if the Holy Spirit leads us to give a word of fellowship, we should supply others without any flavor of condemnation. If we condemn the churches based on what we have seen, we will fall into danger. It is good to see something, but we also must advance and grow in life in order to be rich in spirit; then we will spontaneously be a supply to the churches. Although there are churches in different localities, we are still one Body. If our locality has truly received revelation, this revelation will become a supply to the Body sooner or later. There is no need for impulsive promotions or rash declarations that others are wrong and only we are right. Such an improper spirit and inappropriate methods will only bring in a negative result.</p>
<p>Our human body is an organism of life, and everything related to life is spontaneous. A good doctor does not prescribe radical treatments, and the best medications are those that the body can absorb slowly in order to heal itself of diseases. Treatments that are too radical can be deadly to the body. If a local church, even in a remote place, has truly learned some lessons and has been richly blessed, the riches that it enjoys will eventually reach and supply other local churches.</p>
<p>We should never be impulsive, but instead, we should bring everything to the Lord and wait on Him. The work of the Holy Spirit does not need our impulsiveness. We should be quiet before the Lord, because the Lord always has a way. Even if churches elsewhere have needs, the Lord has a way for them. We should care for our own locality and receive for our own locality so that the Holy Spirit has the opportunity to infuse our locality with the riches and gradually strengthen the whole Body. The supply that our locality receives is for the Body, and it will spontaneously operate in the whole Body.</p>
<p>Over ten years ago a brother claimed that he saw a vision, and he even asked another co-worker to confirm whether or not he had the ministry of the age. I cannot say that this brother did not see anything, but his vouching for himself had no bearing on whether or not he had the ministry of the age. Only life and the issue of life can vouch for us. If a brother can supply people, then the churches in Taiwan and the churches all over the earth will be supplied gradually. Then, even if he says that he does not have the ministry of the age, others will say that he does. The ministry of the age is the ministry of the age; it does not need to be self-confirmed or proclaimed. If we see something, we do not have to &ldquo;publicize&rdquo; it, and neither should we feel that only we have seen something.</p>
<p>In our work there is no need to rush to change things. If we go to Indonesia, there is no need to touch or change the churches in Indonesia. We should only minister life whenever there is the opportunity. There is no need to change methods or to touch matters of right and wrong. We should simply minister life when we have the opportunity. Even when we minister life, we need to be pure and simple so that people may receive this life. If we do this, even if we live there for a year or two, we will not fall into right and wrong. Our going to a place should never stir up matters of right and wrong or cause problems.</p>
<p>The brothers frequently make the mistake of being too impulsive and rash. Even if we see that a certain church has a need, we do not need to be impulsive. Instead, we should consider our position when we speak. A sister should remember that she is a sister when she speaks, a brother should remember that he is a brother when he speaks, an older one should remember that he is an older one when he speaks, and a young one should remember that he is a young one when he speaks. Some spiritual words can come only from an elderly person, not from a young person. We should not reject the words of another based simply on his human status; there are distinctions of age and position that cannot be annulled absolutely. Furthermore, we should be aware that there are distinctions related to location as well as human status. For example, some words that are suitable for the church in Tainan are not suitable for the situation of the church in Taipei. Similarly, I can speak some words to my family but not the same words to the saints in a meeting.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us that we would learn these matters. Otherwise, haste will result in waste, and we will experience results that are the opposite of our intention. If I speak a strong word, this does not mean that you should go out and speak the same words in the same way, because people will receive what I say but not necessarily what you say. Some words that come from me could never come from you. If you say the same thing, you will get into trouble and even hurt yourself. It is not easy to be a doctor who can effectively treat diseases. First, one needs much study and practice in order to accumulate experience. Furthermore, there is a need for a proper examination and understanding of a patient&rsquo;s condition in order for a proper treatment to be prescribed. It is the same with the church; we must be cautious in every aspect of our service. The church is the Body of Christ; we should not touch it lightly. If we do not touch it properly, we will suffer loss, and others will suffer as well. This can be seen in the history of those who claimed to have seen a vision over ten years ago but who eventually left. Today their work has not produced much fruit. In addition to damaging many people, they also damaged themselves. We must learn these lessons today.</p>
