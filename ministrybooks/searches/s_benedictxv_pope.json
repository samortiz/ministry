Pope Benedict XV received these guests courteously and thanked them for coming to him. However, the Pope told them that the Roman Catholic Church could not attend their conference. He said, \u201cI am the descendant of St. Peter, and the representative of Christ. My greatest hope is that there will be one flock, with one shepherd.\u201d He referred to the Roman Catholic Church as the one flock, and to himself as the one shepherd! In these days men are trying to negotiate with the Pope again. "}]}
