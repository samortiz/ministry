Attempting to Teach the Lord</h2><h2 class="head5">1) "This Ointment Could Have Been...Given to the Poor"</h2><p>Sometimes men were not only dissatisfied with the Lord; they even tried to teach the Lord. The disciples said, "Why has this waste of the ointment been made? For this ointment could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and given to the poor" (Mark 14:4-5). They were teaching the Lord. The disciples could think of another way to dispose of the ointment&mdash;sell it and give it to the poor. But the Lord knew what Mary was doing. He said that she was doing a noble deed. The Lord never does one thing or says one thing that He is not clear about. He needs no one to correct Him. Only a foolish man will try to correct the Lord or teach Him.</p><h2 class="head5">2) "God Be Merciful to You!"</h2><p>When the Lord indicated to the disciples that He had to go to Jerusalem, Peter said, "God be merciful to You, Lord!" What did the Lord say? He said, "Get behind Me, Satan!" (Matt. 16:21-23). Peter wanted to teach the Lord, but it did not work. On the contrary, he only exposed his own foolishness.</p><h2 class="head5">3) "What Sort of Woman This Is"</h2><p>Once the Lord Jesus ate at the house of Simon the Pharisee. A woman stood at the Lord's feet weeping, wetting His feet with her tears, and wiping them with the hair of her head. Simon thought in his heart, "This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him" (Luke 7:39). Here we should pay attention to Simon's spirit. He seemed to be saying, "Look what kind of woman she is. How can You allow her to come near to You at Your feet?" Although Simon did not open his mouth, the Lord knew what he was thinking, and He spoke about different kinds of forgiving. In effect the Lord was saying, "You, Simon, did not wash My feet, because you have experienced little forgiveness. This woman experienced much forgiveness. This is the reason she wet My feet with her tears." Once we have such an impression, we will realize how foolish it is for man to try to be the Lord's counselor! At the same time, we will know a Jesus of Nazareth that we did not know before.</p><h2 class="head4">c. The Lord Likes to See Men<br />Asking Great Things from Him</h2><p>In studying the Gospels carefully, we find that the Lord took pleasure in men asking Him for great favor. The greater men's requests were, the happier the Lord was to answer them.</p><h2 class="head5">1) "If You Are Willing, You Can Cleanse Me"</h2><p>Consider the story of the leper in Mark 1. According to Jewish regulations, a leper could not come in contact with any man. Any person who came in contact with a leper was defiled by uncleanness (Lev. 13&mdash;14). Here a leper came to see the Lord Jesus. The very act of coming to the Lord was quite presumptuous. We should have a strong impression of this fact. As soon as a leper appeared on the scene, we probably would react. Unless a man was ready to sacrifice himself and give his all, he would jump back at the sight of a leper and say, "You are hurting me! I cannot touch you. Why do you come to me?" When the leper came to the Lord, he did not ask whether the Lord could cleanse him. Instead he said, "If You are willing, You can cleanse me" (Mark 1:40). This was a very piercing statement. He put all the burden on the Lord! It was all a matter of whether or not the Lord was willing. This was not an ordinary prayer. It was something that put the Lord's heart to the test. The Lord simply could have said, "Be clean," and the leper would have been cleansed. But the Lord did not merely utter a word; He identified Himself with the leper's situation. He touched the leper with His hand and said, "I am willing; be cleansed!" (v. 41). If he was not cleansed, the Lord would become defiled. What a risk this would have involved! We must have the proper impression of the story before we can understand the actual picture. The Lord was ready to put Himself into the leper's situation. He joined His holiness and purity to the leper. Either both would be clean or both would be defiled. Either both had to go outside the camp or both could return to the camp. The Lord was ready to spend, and what a spending that was!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 54: How to Study the Bible & The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
