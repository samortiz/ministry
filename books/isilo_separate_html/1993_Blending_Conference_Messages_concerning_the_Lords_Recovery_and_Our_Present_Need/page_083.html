We also need to confess our sinful nature, its defilements, its attachment to the contamination of the world, and its oldness, asking for the Lord's cleansing with His precious blood. All of these things concerning our sinful nature related to our fallen human being and our natural man become real hindrances to the blending, so our confession is a real need for the vital groups. We need to have the thorough fellowship, and we also need to confess all of the hindrances that we may be blended together into one accord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Thorough Consecration of Themselves and<br>of All That They Have and Do to the Lord</H2><P>We also need to make a thorough consecration of ourselves and of all that we have and do to the Lord. In order to be vital persons and have the vital groups, we must be desperate. We need to be the vital persons, the overcomers, to rescue the church from its degradation. The Lord will gain what He desires through His overcomers.</P><P>To be such people we need to put aside our personal interests, our care for the necessities of this life, and make a strong resolution and an absolute consecration to the Lord. Second Timothy 2:4 says that no soldier entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please the one who enlisted him. If we are going to be vital persons, we must clear away all earthly entanglements.</P><P>In the Old Testament, there is the principle of the Nazarite. This is the principle we need to take today. We need to make, with much and thorough prayer, a Nazarite's consecration to the Lord (Num. 6:1-4). In the Old Testament, one could be a priest by birth according to the order of Aaron. But if the priesthood became degraded, the Lord made a provision for others to become priests by voluntary consecration. During a time of degradation there needs to be people who voluntarily consecrate themselves to the Lord in an absolute way as Nazarites.</P><P>John the Baptist was a Nazarite (Luke 1:15). He was born as a priest, but he did not function according to the principle of the order of Aaron. He functioned according to the principle of the Nazarite. This man was used by the Lord to change the age. He ended the Old Testament priesthood and was the beginning of the New Testament priesthood. In order to be the New Testament priests of the gospel (Rom. 15:16) we need to make a Nazarite's consecration to the Lord.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_082.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_084.html">Next</a> </body></html>
