   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ASKING GOD FOR WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 5 James says, But if anyone of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and does not reproach, and it will be given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was by His wisdom that God, in Christ, made His eternal plan and carried it out 1 Cor 2:7; Eph 3:9-11; Prov 8:12, 22-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And in His New Testament economy God first made Christ our wisdom 1 Cor 1:24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wisdom of God is needed for practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, we need to ask God for it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the composition of this Epistle, although it seems that James did not have a clear vision concerning God s New Testament economy, he had the wisdom to portray things concerning the practical Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>James was reputed to be a man of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here he charged those who received his Epistle to pray for wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This implies that his own wisdom was given by God through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this Epistle James emphasizes prayer 5:14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prayer is a virtue of practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 5 James tells us that if we lack wisdom, we should ask God for it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to be perfect in our behavior, the basic need is for wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A foolish person cannot be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we are full of wisdom, then in every activity of our daily life we shall behave perfectly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that perfection is mainly carried out through wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A wise person can be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if we lack wisdom, we may offend others by our foolish talk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our speaking may indicate that we do not have adequate wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are short of wisdom, we should ask God for it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>James says that if we ask God for wisdom, He will give generously and will not reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To give generously is to give with simplicity and liberality, without reserve Rom 12:8; 2 Cor 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>James word here indicates that he is godly and that he knows God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this verse James did not say, If you lack wisdom, you should learn of me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me give you some lectures or some books to read.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then you will have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of speaking this way, James, being godly, encourages the readers of his Epistle to ask of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He knows God and in particular knows that God is generous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>James tells us in this verse that when God gives, He does not reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But a stingy person does not want to give anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he does give something, he may give with reproach, with stinging words.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The generous God is not like such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God gives generously, and He gives without reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being a godly man, a man who knew God, James realized this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ASKING IN FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 6 James goes on to say, But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing, for he who doubts is like a surge of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek words rendered doubting and doubts also mean wavering and wavers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Someone who wavers in prayer is like a surge of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A DOUBLE-SOULED PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verses 7 and 8 say, For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is a double-souled man, unstable in all his ways.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God made man only one soul, with one mind and one will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a believer doubts in prayer, he makes himself double-souled, like a boat with two rudders, unstable in direction.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Faith in prayer is also a virtue of practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verses 6 through 8 indicate that James surely was a godly man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No doubt, he was a man of wisdom, a man of faith, and a man of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As such a man, he knew God.</S>
