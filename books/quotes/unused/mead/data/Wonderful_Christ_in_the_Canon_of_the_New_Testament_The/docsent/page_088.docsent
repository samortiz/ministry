   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S FARM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third aspect is that the church is God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is what the Apostle Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 3:9.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For we are laborers together with God: ye are God s farm, ye are God s building Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. Christ came and sowed Himself as a seed into the human field.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now this seed is growing up, and God has a crop.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this crop could never be harvested as long as it is green.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is the need of maturity so that the crop will ripen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With any crop there is the principle that part of it ripens early, and another part later.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The early ripened ones are the firstfruits, and the rest become the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regardless of whether we are the firstfruits or the harvest, we all must be ripened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then God will reap us either into the temple as the firstfruits, or into the barn in the air as the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CHRIST S BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is not only the lampstand, the woman that produces the manchild to defeat the enemy, and the ripened crop, but also Christ s Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why the church must make herself ready for the marriage of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints Rev 19:7-8, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>. GOD S ETERNAL HABITATION</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually the church must become God s eternal habitation, the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the New Jerusalem, the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now she is not only made ready, but also adorned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Bride, not yet as God s habitation, a white raiment to clothe her is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But for God s habitation she needs to be built up with transformed precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is the great high wall, the gates of pearl, and the city proper, which is golden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not merely something made ready, but something adorned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She is adorned with gold, pearl, and precious stones not merely a piece of clothing for God s eternal habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you seen these five aspects of the church in the book of Revelation?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have seen every aspect, and it is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From now on we must never tell others that the book of Revelation is a book of the ugly beast, the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven vials.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must share how it is a book of seven golden lampstands, a wonderful woman, God s crop, a prepared Bride, and God s eternal tabernacle adorned with gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Revelation is also a book of the seven Spirits, as well as of the wonderful Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He comes in Revelation 18:1, the whole earth will be lightened by His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is His being the light of the world in a complete and full sense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No other book is so wonderful as this book of Revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A MATTER OF EATING AND DRINKING</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now let me ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How could the wonderful woman in Revelation 12 conceive the manchild?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All expectant mothers know that the child within them grows according to what they eat.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If they eat properly, the child within them grows properly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they eat adequately, the child grows adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If an expectant mother does not eat and drink, it is the baby that will die first.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever the mother eats is mainly for her child within.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The manchild grows by the woman s eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even after the manchild has been raptured to the throne, the woman still needs to nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent Rev 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is the same with the ripening of the crop.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How could the crop reach maturity?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is only by eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The eating is the proper fertilizing, and the drinking is the watering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The crop must always be fertilized and watered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this way the crop eats and drinks and grows.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The best way to be one of the firstfruits is to be faithful in eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How then does the Bride in Revelation 19 prepare herself?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today a girl who is getting married may go to a store to buy material to make a dress.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But this Bride is clothed with fine linen, bright and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This could never be bought in any store, for it is the righteousnesses of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is Christ growing up and living out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we live out Christ by letting Him grow in us, He will be our living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The only way that Christ can grow in us and live out of us is by our eating and drinking Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not different with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The picture shows us clearly how the holy city is adorned with gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is the river of water of life for drinking, and there is the tree of life for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life Rev 22:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is altogether by eating and drinking that this city is adorned with the precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The center of the New Jerusalem is God s throne, and upon this throne is God within the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God is now the redeeming God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is shown in Revelation 4:3, where John said that the One sitting upon the throne looked like a jasper and a sardine stone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The jasper is green, and sardine is red.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Green signifies life, and red signifies redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Green signifies God s divinity, and red signifies the redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the Lamb-God, sitting on the throne in the center of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Out from the throne flows the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This living water flows out of the Lamb-God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is clear that this is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In typology, the water of life flowed out of the cleft rock Exo 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Jesus told us that if we are thirsty, we should come to Him and drink, and out of our innermost being will flow rivers of living water John 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>John then tells us that Jesus was speaking of the Spirit John 7:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Here we have a picture of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God is in the Lamb, and out of this Lamb-God flows the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the river of water of life grows the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The tree of life signifies Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This means that the Triune God flows out to water and supply the whole city.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then this city will be transformed into precious materials and built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This depends upon the whole city feeding on Jesus as the tree of life and drinking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is altogether a matter of eating and drinking.</S>
