   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WORKS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of all the matters concerning God in the Bible, the most important portions concern the works of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The names of God tell us who God is, the attributes of God tell us what kind of God He is, and the works of God reveal God s operation and move in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the works of God are the most central revelation concerning God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we will discuss them in two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. God s Operation</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first group consists of five main points:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Planning</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Ephesians 1:9, 11, and 3:11, plan or purpose is translated into will in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, the meaning of the original Greek word does not refer merely to a will; it refers more to a plan, a purpose, according to a will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, we may have the will to build a large meeting hall, but we may not have the plan; if we had a plan, the will would surely be included in the plan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The plan of God is something in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 1:11 tells us that we were predestinated according to God s purpose, God s plan, and verse 4 says this predestination took place before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>a. Economy</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek word for economy has the meaning of arrangement, management, and dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the Greek, arrangement in Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9 is better rendered economy, since the meaning of economy is stronger than that of arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, if we were to set up chairs in the meeting hall, we can call it an arrangement because it is a trivial task.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we want to run a big business or open a large factory, we cannot call this an arrangement; instead we should call it an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s plan is a great matter; therefore, in God s plan there is an economy, and this economy includes management, administration, arrangement, and dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Selection</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The goal of God s eternal plan is to build a dwelling place for Himself and to build the Body of Christ His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other words, it is to choose a bride for His Son and to gain a corporate vessel for Himself as His full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To accomplish this goal, He chose man, whom He had created, before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s selection is not merely to save us, but to accomplish His eternal plan Eph 1:4; 1 Pet 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Predestination</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Predestination is to mark us out.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In eternity, while carrying out His economy according to His plan, God chose us according to His foreknowledge and sealed and designated us Eph 1:5; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Creating a. Original Creation</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The record in Genesis 1:1, which says, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, refers to God s original creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At this point man had not been created; only the angels had been created.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among the angels there was a leader, God s anointed cherub, whom God set over the original universe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At one point, this anointed archangel, due to his pride, rebelled against God and became Satan, God s adversary.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The original universe under his rule became corrupted and was brought under God s judgment with water covering the surface of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Further Restoration</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The matter of restoration is spoken of from Genesis 1:2 to the end of Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The original creation was submerged under water; it was waste and emptiness, with darkness on the surface of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, God came in to restore.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, He ordered the heavenly luminaries to give light, and then He ordered the water on the earth to gather together so that dry land would appear.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This restoration rearranged and restored the heavens and the earth that had been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sphere of His restoration is the universe, all things are the means, and human beings are the center.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s creation is for the expression of God Himself.</S>
