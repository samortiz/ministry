   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Seated with Christ in the Heavenlies</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Through the divine transmission from the ascended Christ to the church, the Man-Savior s ascension is definitely related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There can be no doubt that we are connected to Him in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason, Ephesians 2:6 tells us that we are seated together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For years I could not understand how, in the words of Ephesians 2:6, we can be seated in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have found electricity an excellent illustration in helping us to understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The electricity that operates in our homes is also in the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that at the same time electricity is both in the power plant and in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, through the divine transmission we are joined to Christ in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not something superstitious; it is a marvelous fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The power that is in the heavenly power plant is also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Reality of the Divine Transmission</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though we cannot see this power, it is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot see the power that keeps the planets in position in the solar system, but it is nevertheless a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not say, Christ s ascension is something far away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I can t understand it, and I can t see the divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Neither can you see the power that keeps the planets revolving around the sun, but you still believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to believe that in the divine, spiritual realm there is a power that transmits to us all that Christ has attained and obtained in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What Christ has attained and obtained in His ascension is beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But whatever He has attained and obtained is now being transmitted into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as we are clean receptacles and are willing to open ourselves, this transmission will take place continually.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Experiencing the Divine Transmission</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By now we should be able to see the connection, or the relationship, between us and Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a power, a divine current, flowing from the ascended Christ to the church, just as electricity flows from the power plant into a building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not only believe in the divine transmission; we need to experience it day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can testify that because I experience this transmission, nothing can defeat me, frustrate me, or hold me down.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Light, life supply, and sustaining power come to me continually because of this divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you know where the church should be today?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church should be in the transmission of the exalted and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ has been raised from among the dead and seated at God s right hand in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All things have been subjected under His feet, and He has been given the headship over the entire universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now whatever He has attained and obtained in these four steps taken by God concerning Him is being transmitted into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This transmission is indicated by the phrase toward us who believe in Ephesians 1:19 and the phrase to the church in verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this transmission the church shares with Christ in all His attainments: the resurrection from among the dead, being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord for the transmission into our being of the Christ who is both in resurrection and in ascension!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only is Christ in us; His resurrection and ascension are also in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the processed, all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit, Christ dwells in us today with His humanity, divinity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All this is being transmitted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Concerning the experience of the divine transmission, we have all been hindered by the distorted teachings of traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many Christians have never heard of the things concerning Christ s ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In particular, they have no concept regarding divine transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The traditional teachings have given many of us an improper education, and this kind of education has held us back from experiencing Christ in His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I urge you to empty yourselves in order to receive something newer and deeper from the divine revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Testament reveals that our Christ is in resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever He has obtained and attained in His resurrection and ascension is now being transmitted into us by the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We simply need to open ourselves and say, Lord, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I love You, and I give myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lord, I empty my whole being for You.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you pray like this, you will experience and enjoy this divine transmission.</S>
