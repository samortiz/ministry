<h2 class=head1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS FOR TODAY</h2><p>Is the age today not dark? Is it not degraded? What we need is the seven Spirits. Christ today is not only the Spirit, but the seven Spirits. These seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ, walking among the churches.<p>The Christ in you has seven eyes! He is watching and shining in you. However troublesome the doctrine sounds, in your experience you are surely aware of His eyes upon you. The more you love the Lord, the more you sense His searching of you and the clearer the vision is. From whatever angle you try to avoid His searching gaze, those seven eyes do not miss anything. A light word, some impulsive greediness, or some covetousness—all bring the seven eyes to focus on you. Wherever you go you cannot escape.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST DISPENSED INTO US</h2><p>The Christ God has dispensed into us is salvation and life. He is not a doctrine or a religion. He is the living, life-giving One with seven eyes, watching and penetrating our being. The result is that we become transparent. This indicates that Christ has been worked into us.<p>To God Christ is His mystery; to us Christ is God’s economy. God’s dispensing is still going on. Whether we are praying at home, attending morning watch, pray-reading, or fellowshipping with each other, God is dispensing Himself into us. Even when we deal with our sins, repenting and confessing, God is dispensing. The Christ He dispenses is not just the Spirit, but the seven Spirits.<p>Praise the Lord that we are in His economy! Christ, the mystery of God and the economy of God, is being dispensed into us.
