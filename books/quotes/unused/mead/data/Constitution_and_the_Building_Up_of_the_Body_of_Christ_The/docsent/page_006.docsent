   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO GROW CHRIST IN THE GOOD EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE HUMAN HEART FOR HIS MULTIPLICATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO BE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO FULFILL GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ has sown Himself into our heart as the growing earth to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I was young, I was taught that I must learn the Bible doctrines and teachings, but no one ever told me that I must grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would like to impress you all with this and encourage you to remember just one thing: Now that Christ is in you, you must grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What do you do every day?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Growing Christ must be your main job.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ grows in the good earth Matt 13:8, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the good earth?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The good earth is a good heart that is pure, simple to God, and also absolute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is in this good heart as the good earth that Christ grows.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If on the one hand you love Christ and, on the other hand, you love many things besides Him, your heart is not single, pure, and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a heart is not a good heart, and such a heart cannot grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps you have stones in your heart, or thorns and thistles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these things compete with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are in rivalry with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a heart cannot grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of us need to purify our heart, simplify our heart, and deal with our heart so that it would be absolute toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then our heart will be the good earth for growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This growing of Christ is for Christ's multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus told us that He was the one grain of wheat John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If He had not fallen into the earth to die, He would have remained one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But He fell into the earth and died, and He brought forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These many grains are His multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Two thousand years ago there was only one Jesus in Palestine, but today on this earth there are millions of "Jesuses."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus has been multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His multiplication is for the constitution of the church in order to fulfill God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has a big project, which is called His eternal economy Eph 3:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His eternal economy is just to sow Christ into many human beings through you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>So today we all have to be sowers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through us more grains will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the multiplication for the constitution of the Body of Christ, which is the church.</S>
