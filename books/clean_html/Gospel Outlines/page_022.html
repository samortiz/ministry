<h1 class="title">THE JUDGMENT OF SODOM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 18, 19; Matt. 11:23-24</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The corruption of Sodom<br />
<span class="normal"><em>You should touch people&rsquo;s feeling from the very beginning.</em> Make it plain that the corruption of Sodom was centered in immorality, with adultery and fornication at its worst. Based on this point, describe the immoral situation in today&rsquo;s society, including such things as dancing, movies, nude pictures, obscene novels and photos, etc. Today&rsquo;s best selling books are the obscene ones. Today&rsquo;s world is an adulterous world. You should make mention of divorce and other abnormal relationships between men and women. Just as the corruption of Sodom in that day was centered in immorality, so also is the world today.</span></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In this section make it clear that all the corruption of man is laid open before the eyes of God (Heb. 4:13). Nothing is hidden from God.</li>
	<li>The corruption of mankind provoked God&rsquo;s righteous wrath.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s wrath caused God to judge men.</li>
	<li>Men&rsquo;s corruption is centered in immorality, and God&rsquo;s judgment is centered in fire. All the immoral people will be burned by fire. The same fire that burned Sodom in that day shall also burn this immoral world in a day to come. This fire is the lake of fire.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Deliverance in the midst of judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In this section point out that in the midst of the corrupted people there were some who feared God. In this message do not say that Lot was evil; rather, say that he was a righteous man.</li>
	<li>Point out that when God executes His judgment, He also saves those who belong to Him.</li>
	<li>God not only saves those who believe in Him; He is also willing to save all of the believer&rsquo;s relatives. Tell how Lot&rsquo;s wife, daughters, and sons-in-law were not willing to go out of the city, and how the angels persuaded them to go out.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Men&rsquo;s negligence toward the gospel
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As a basis, tell how those who heard Lot and the angels preaching the gospel thought that they were jesting and would not believe.</li>
	<li>Go on to say that today people also think that we are either not serious or that we are superstitious.</li>
	<li>Conclude that those who will be burned by fire will be those who heard the gospel but made light of it.</li>
	</ol></li>
