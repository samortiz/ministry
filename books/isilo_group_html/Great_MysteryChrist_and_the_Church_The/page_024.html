THE MYSTERY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:2-10, 14-19</h1>
<p>We have seen that the mystery of God is Christ and that the mystery of Christ is the church (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4-6). Christ and the church are the great mystery (5:32). God is a mystery. Our mysterious God dwells in Christ bodily (Col. 2:9). Everything of God is in Christ. When we see Christ, we see God (John 14:9). When we contact Christ, we contact God. Hence, when we have Christ, we have God. Christ is the embodiment of God. Nevertheless, Christ is also a mystery. The mystery of Christ is the church. Just as God is embodied in Christ, Christ is embodied in the church. Once we contact the church, we contact Christ. When we are in the church, we are in Christ. The church is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CHURCH DEPENDING<br />
ON CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider Ephesians 3:17: &ldquo;That Christ may make His home in your hearts.&rdquo; Christ making His home in our hearts is a mystery. This verse does not speak of Christ making His home in our <em>homes</em> but of Christ making His home in our <em>hearts</em>. Most Christians only know that Christ is with them; very few are clear that Christ wants to make His home in their hearts. Hence, many Christians only believe in and experience Christ being with them in a general way. However, Christ wanting to make His home in our hearts is a very specific process. Our heart is the central part of our being, and Christ wants to make His home in the central part of our being. The making of His home in our hearts is not something outward or superficial; it touches the depths of our being for our experience of the reality of the church life. In Christianity today we can barely see any reality or manifestation of the church. The manifestation of the church depends on Christ making His home in our hearts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEVEN MAJOR ITEMS IN EPHESIANS 3</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3 presents seven crucial items. The first crucial item is the mystery of Christ in verse 4. <em>The mystery of Christ</em> indicates that Christ is a mystery, but this mystery is no longer hidden in the heavens or in God. Christ as the mystery has been revealed to us and in us, and He now dwells in us. Colossians speaks of this mystery when it says, &ldquo;Christ in you&rdquo; (1:27). We have something mysterious in our hearts&mdash;Christ. Today Christ is no longer merely objective; He has reached us and is in us subjectively. Christ is not only outside of us in our surroundings but also in our hearts, in the deepest part of our being. Thus, He is a mystery.</p>
<p>As Christians, we are joyful because Christ is in us, but others do not know the reason why we are so joyful. It almost seems to them that we are in the heavens, not on earth. This is a mystery to them. We can bear what others cannot bear, but the source of our strength and power is a mystery. We can love those who are difficult to love and also be virtuous toward others, but the source of our love and virtue is difficult to understand. We truly are a mystery to others. However, this is not a matter of mystery to us; we know the source of our power and life. Christ within us is our power and our life. The secret to our Christian life is Christ in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Unsearchable Riches of Christ</h2>
<p>The second crucial point of Ephesians 3 is the unsearchable riches of Christ in verse 8. In this verse Paul says, &ldquo;To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel,&rdquo; and in verse 2 he says, &ldquo;If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you.&rdquo; Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians 9:17 he says, &ldquo;I am entrusted with a stewardship.&rdquo; <em>Stewardship</em> here involves the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ. It is not merely the riches of Christ but the unsearchable riches of Christ. Paul did not announce teachings or theology; he announced the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>What are the unsearchable riches of Christ? The first item of the content of the riches of Christ is God. In Christ people find God. God is precious, but God can be found only in Christ. The second item of the content of the riches of Christ is the divine life. This life is very subjective, and it is very crucial. The divine life is in Christ. If we want to have the divine life, we must have Christ. The third item of the content of the riches of Christ is His perfect humanity. All human beings have defects and blemishes. We may feel good about ourselves at times, but more often than not we are dissatisfied with ourselves, because we know that we are not good. Only Christ is perfect; He has no shortcomings. He is the perfect man. If we want to have a fitting, perfect humanity, we must have Christ. Once we have Christ, we have God, life, and Christ&rsquo;s perfect humanity. We cannot list all of His riches, because they are unsearchable.</p>
<p>Paul announced this unsearchably rich Christ as the gospel. By God&rsquo;s mercy and grace, we must announce Him in this way as well. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we should not announce teachings or theology but the living Christ. We must minister this rich Christ to others; He is full of riches. We need to minister this Christ with His unsearchable riches to others day by day.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Great Mystery-Christ and the Church &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
