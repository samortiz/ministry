   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>18.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Testimony the Law</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 25:21 says, In the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Exodus 31:18, the tables of stone on which the Ten Commandments were written are called the two tables of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the law was God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because the law, God s testimony, was placed in the ark, the ark was called the ark of testimony Exo 25:22; 26:33-34 ; and because the ark was in the tabernacle, the tabernacle was called the tabernacle of testimony Exo 38:21; Num 1:50,53 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The law was called the testimony because it testifies of God; it testifies what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In particular, the law, the Ten Commandments, testifies that God is holy and righteous and that He is love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In nature our God is love 1 John 4:8 , and in expression He is light 1 John 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is also holy in nature and righteous in all His activities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The law testifies that He is such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the testimony of God, the law is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The real, living, full, and adequate testimony of God is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ describes God and expresses Him in a full and adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the law, the testimony, typifies Christ as God s living testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law was given, but Christ came to be the living expression of God John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Christ came, the testimony of God became a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Wherever the Lord Jesus went, He expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever He did and said expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason He is called the faithful Witness Rev 1:5; 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the faithful Witness, Christ is the testimony of God, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He testifies that God is holy and righteous and that He is love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is the reality of the testimony typified by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Aaron</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Aaron is a type of Christ as the High Priest Exo 28:3; Heb 5:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Aaron was called and established by God to be the high priest Heb 5:4, 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is even more true with Christ, who did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest but was ordained by God Heb 5:5 , having been chosen as a man to go to God with the needs of man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Aaron, as the high priest, took care of things pertaining to God on behalf of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is superior to him in taking care of all of our cases before God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In type, Aaron offered both gifts and sacrifices for the people and himself Heb 5:1, 3 , but, in reality, Christ offered Himself as the sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As typified by Aaron, Christ offered Himself to God for our sins Heb 7:27; 9:14, 26; 10:10, 12 , made propitiation for our sins Heb 2:17 , and made purification for our sins, after which He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the cross, Christ, offering sacrifice to God for our sins, was a High Priest typified by Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, this aspect of Christ s priesthood, the Aaronic priesthood, is mainly for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Aaron was established in honor to be the high priest only for his lifetime, for he was prevented by death from continuing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But Christ was ordained in glory to be our High Priest forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With Him there is no preventing of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is glorified forever to be our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the high priest in type, Aaron bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and on his heart Exo 28:9-10, 12, 21, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today, as the High Priest in reality, Christ is in the heavens bearing us and holding us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the Offerings</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Old Testament Christ is typified by all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Testament reveals that in His person Christ is the fulfillment of these types.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>a. The Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The burnt offering Lev 1:3 , which was wholly for God s satisfaction, typifies Christ as God s pleasure and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He made God happy and satisfied Him because He always did God s will John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38 and sought His glory John 7:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever God wanted, Christ did.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, He pleased God and satisfied Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Leviticus 1, the burnt offering was burned to ashes as God s food to satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Hebrew word for burnt offering actually means ascending sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When this offering was burned on the altar, it became a sweet savor ascending to God for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the reason Numbers 28:2 and 3 speak of the burnt offering as God s food.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s food, the burnt offering, satisfies Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As the fulfillment of the type of the burnt offering, Christ is God s food.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ has been burned to feed God and satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Meal Offering</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The meal offering Lev 2:1 typifies Christ in His humanity as food for God and especially for those who have fellowship with God and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In His humanity Christ is our food and constant satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The meal offering was made of fine flour mingled with oil Lev 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fine flour, with its evenness and fineness, typifies Christ s perfect humanity with its balance, evenness, and fineness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The four Gospels portray the fineness of the Lord s behavior in His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The oil mingled with the fine flour signifies the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This mingling typifies the mingling of divinity with humanity in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The frankincense added to the meal offering Lev 2:15 signifies the fragrance of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is Christ typified by the meal offering, the mingling of humanity and divinity with the fragrant manifestation of resurrection life to be our daily nourishment and supply.</S>
