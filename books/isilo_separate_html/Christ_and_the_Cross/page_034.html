<h1 class="title">THE NEGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3:15; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; 16:11; 1 Pet. 2:24; Rom. 8:3; Gal. 6:14; 5:24; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Heb. 10:20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEGATIVE FUNCTION OF THE CROSS&mdash;<br />
THE ASPECT OF TERMINATION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that God determined the positive function of the cross according to His eternal plan. Similarly, God determined the negative function of the cross according to His eternal plan. In order to accomplish the good pleasure of His will, God determined to release His life through the cross. At the same time, however, God knew that He would encounter the consequences of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and man&rsquo;s fall in the process of accomplishing His eternal will. In order to solve these problems, God determined to terminate through the cross everything that would be contrary to Him. In its positive function the cross releases everything that is of God, and in its negative function the cross terminates everything that is not of God, everything that is contrary to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating Satan</h2>
<p>In the universe the first thing contrary to God is Satan. As the Daystar (Isa. 14:12), Satan was one of the earliest angels created by God at the &ldquo;dawn&rdquo; of the universe, and he was the first among God&rsquo;s creation to rebel against God. He was the initiator of rebellion, the originator of sin in the universe (John 8:44). He then led a group of God-created angels to rebel against God (cf. Rev. 12:4, 9) and enticed the God-created man to forsake God (Gen. 3:1-7). He led astray a group of God-created angels in heaven, and he beguiled the God-created man on the earth. He infringed upon God&rsquo;s glory and authority, damaged God&rsquo;s arrangement and order, violated God&rsquo;s holiness and righteousness, and defiled God&rsquo;s creation and work. He wanted to frustrate God&rsquo;s will and usurp His throne (Isa. 14:13-14). God&rsquo;s uniquely honored name was blasphemed, and His divine dignity was insulted. Satan was the first problem that God encountered in accomplishing His will. Therefore, Satan was the first item that God had to deal with and terminate by the cross.</p>
<p>When Satan first appears in the Bible, he is in the form of a serpent, seeking to ensnare man in sin (Gen. 3:1-7). In His judgment on the serpent, God prophesied that the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of the woman would &ldquo;bruise&rdquo; the serpent on the head (v. 15). Bruising a serpent&rsquo;s head deals a fatal blow to the serpent and puts it to death. The seed of the woman is a reference to Christ in His first coming, for only He among mankind was &ldquo;born of a woman&rdquo; (Gal. 4:4; Matt. 1:23). God&rsquo;s prophecy concerning Satan in Genesis 3:15 clearly indicates that Christ would come to put Satan to death.</p>
<p>Satan resented to the uttermost Christ&rsquo;s coming to the earth, and at God&rsquo;s appointed time Satan was allowed to inflict death upon Christ. Satan thought that he could cut Christ off from the earth. The wound inflicted upon Christ, however, merely bruised His heel and afflicted Him (v. 15). This bruising did not destroy Christ through death; rather, it gave Him an opportunity to destroy Satan, who had the might of death, through His death on the cross (Heb. 2:14). Before Christ died on the cross, He declared, &ldquo;Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out&rdquo; (John 12:31), and in Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, Satan, &ldquo;the ruler of this world,&rdquo; was judged (16:11). The cross of Christ terminated Satan.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ has a negative function of terminating Satan. The effect of cross of Christ was a deathblow to Satan; he was destroyed on the cross. Wherever the cross is applied, Satan and his work are destroyed. Thus, he has no ground, and he cannot move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cross Terminating the Authority of Darkness</h2>
<p>When Satan rebelled against God, some of the other angels followed him (cf. Rev. 12:4). Thus, Satan also has &ldquo;his angels&rdquo; (Matt. 25:41). These corrupted angels are now the &ldquo;world-rulers of this darkness,&rdquo; &ldquo;the rulers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the authorities&rdquo; in the heavenlies (Eph. 6:12), and Satan is &ldquo;the ruler of the authority of the air&rdquo; (2:2). When Christ destroyed Satan on the cross, He destroyed these satanic authorities of the air and their authority of darkness. Hence, Colossians 2:15 speaks of Christ &ldquo;stripping off the rulers and the authorities&rdquo; on the cross. The Greek word for <em>stripping off</em> means &ldquo;to spoil, shake off, or put off,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;to put away or terminate.&rdquo; The cross of Christ spoiled Satan&rsquo;s angelic followers and all the authority of darkness in the air by terminating them.</p>
<p>Just as the cross of Christ terminated Satan, it also terminated his angels. At the cross Christ overcame Satan&rsquo;s angels. Wherever the cross is applied, Satan&rsquo;s angels, demons, and evil spirits are put to shame and have no ground to operate.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> </body></html>
