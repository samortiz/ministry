 <p><strong>WEEK 8 &mdash; DAY 4</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Matt. 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rev. 21:22 And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Living God</h2>
<p>A number of verses in the New Testament reveal that God is the living God [Matt. 16:16; 1 Tim. 3:15; Heb. 3:12; 9:14; 10:31; 12:22]. In Matthew 16:16 the Lord Jesus is called the Son of the living God. In this verse the living God is in contrast to dead religion. The living God, who is embodied in Christ, has nothing to do with dead religion.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 3:15 we see that the church, the house of God, is the church of the living God....The living God who lives in the church must be subjective to the church rather than merely objective. An idol in a heathen temple is lifeless. The God who not only lives but also acts, moves, and works in His living temple, the church, is living.<sup>26</sup></p>
<h2 class="head2">In Parables and Signs:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Friend in the Parable of Persisting Prayer</h2>
<p>Luke 11:5-8 speaks of a parable illustrating the persisting prayer. In this parable God to whom we pray is likened to our friend, and we are likened to His friend, indicating that in prayer God is intimate to us and we are intimate to Him in a mutual love. This picture of intimacy between friends annuls the religious concept of &ldquo;reverence&rdquo; in our prayer to God.<sup>27</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Loving and Receiving Father<br />
in the Parable of the Prodigal Son</h2>
<p>In the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32) God is revealed as the loving and receiving Father (vv. 20-24). The prodigal son gathered everything he received from his father and traveled into a distant country where he squandered his estate, living dissolutely (v. 13). After he had spent all of what he took from the father and had fallen into a severe famine (v. 14), he became aware of his condition and made a resolution to go back to his father (vv. 17-18). &ldquo;While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately&rdquo; (v. 20). The father&rsquo;s seeing the son did not happen by chance. Rather, the father went out of the house to look for his prodigal&rsquo;s return. When the father saw his son, he ran to him and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately. This indicates that God the Father runs to receive a returning sinner. What eagerness this shows! The father&rsquo;s falling on his son&rsquo;s neck and kissing him affectionately shows a warm and loving reception. The father then said to his slaves, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry, because this son of mine was dead and lives again; he was lost and has been found&rdquo; (vv. 22-24a).<sup>28</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Temple in the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:22 indicates that God is the temple in the New Jerusalem: &ldquo;And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>temple</em> in this verse, <em>naos,</em> does not denote the whole temple in a common way....It denotes the inner temple, the Holy of Holies. This inner temple is the Lord God, signifying that God will be the place in which we, His redeemed, dwell and serve Him. In the New Jerusalem we shall dwell in God. God Himself will be the dwelling place of all His serving ones.<sup>29</sup> In Psalm 90:1 Moses said, &ldquo;O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations.&rdquo; Moses knew that God Himself is our eternal dwelling place, our eternal habitation. Psalm 90 is a prophecy of this....Our natural mind would never think that we could dwell in God. Nevertheless, the entire city of New Jerusalem will be God Himself as our habitation. The expansion and the enlargement of God will be our eternal city in which we shall dwell for eternity.<sup>30</sup></p>
