<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF A CLEAR VISION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 2:9; John 1:1, 14; Col. 2:2b; Eph. 3:8; 1:23; 3:2-4; 5:32; Col. 1:25-29</h1>
<p>In order to practice the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need a clear vision of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. For this reason, this chapter is a very, very crucial chapter in this book. The word <em>economy</em> is an anglicized word from the Greek word <em>oikonomia.</em> Some English translations of the Bible translate <em>oikonomia</em> into &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; (see 1 Tim. 1:4 of Darby&rsquo;s New Translation, the American Standard Version, and the Recovery Version). Many readers of the Bible do not know what this word means. Dr. C. I. Scofield said that there were seven dispensations in the Bible concerning God&rsquo;s dealing with man from the time Adam was created to the end of the millennium. According to this usage, the seven dispensations are understood as seven ages. These seven ages are the ages of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom. According to Dr. Scofield these dispensations are the seven different ways that God deals with man. Although this understanding is right, the Lord has shown us something further concerning the word <em>economy.</em></p>
<p>This Greek word <em>oikonomia</em> is composed of two words: <em>oikos</em> meaning house or household and <em>nomos</em> meaning law. Thus, <em>economy</em> refers in the scriptural sense to a household law, or household administration. This administration is a plan, an arrangement, or a dispensation. According to today&rsquo;s common usage, the word <em>economy</em> is used for financial matters or the financial situation. But according to the biblical usage in the Greek language, God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s eternal plan, God&rsquo;s eternal arrangement for His administration according to His heart&rsquo;s desire. In the Old Testament there was God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy, God&rsquo;s old arrangement. Now in the New Testament there is a new arrangement, that is, the New Testament economy of God. In order for us to understand the divine revelation, we must understand God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Since the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began among us in China in 1922 through Brother Watchman Nee, the Lord has used us to recover a number of truths from the Word. But the expression <em>the New Testament economy</em> was not used among us in mainland China nor was it used in our work on the island of Taiwan. I did not pick up the term <em>God&rsquo;s economy</em> until we had a summer conference in Los Angeles in 1964. The fellowship from this conference is contained in a book entitled <em>The Economy of God.</em> That was the first time we used the word <em>economy</em> in our publications. Then in 1984, I made a thorough study of this matter. First I went to Brazil and gave a series of messages contained in a book entitled <em>The Divine Economy.</em> Then I went to Stuttgart, Germany and several localities in the United States to release a series of messages contained in the book <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy.</em> Now that the messages in this book have been released, I believe that the all-inclusive truth concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy has been fully recovered. On pages 12 and 13 of this large volume is a chart of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This chart shows that in the Gospels is the Son with the Father and by the Spirit; in Acts and the Epistles is the Spirit as the Son and with the Father; and in Revelation is the seven Spirits out from the Eternal One and of the Redeemer. In other words, the content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is a wonderful Person, and this Person is the Triune God. I recommend that we study this chart and read this book. This book is an extension of this chapter and thoroughly covers the truth concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>In my speaking, I cannot stay away from the Triune God because the Triune God is the basic element in the construction of the Bible, especially of the New Testament. Nearly every book is constructed with the Triune God as the basic element, the basic factor. If we take the Triune God out of the Holy Bible, the Holy Bible will become empty. The real essence of the content of the Bible is the Triune God. The first chapter of the Bible reveals the Triune God (vv. 1, 26). Books such as the Gospel of John, Ephesians, and Revelation are absolutely constructed, composed, and constituted with the divine Trinity as their elements and factors. No one can fully understand the Gospel of John without understanding the Triune God. In John 14:16 the Lord says, &ldquo;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&rdquo; In this short sentence, the Triune God is revealed. The Son asks the Father to give the disciples another Comforter, who is the Spirit of reality (v. 17). Each of the six chapters in the book of Ephesians reveals the Triune God (1:4-14; 2:18; 3:14-19; 4:4-6; 5:19-20; 6:10, 11, 17). Note 14<sup>1</sup> of 2 Corinthians 13:14 in the Recovery Version presents a birds-eye view of the divine Trinity throughout the Holy Scriptures.</p>
