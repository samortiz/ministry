   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM HONG KONG AND CANTON 3 Date:August 30, 1949</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hong Kong CONCERNING THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the key issues related to the work, the first thing I would like to speak about is the coordination among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, the co-workers have to come together to pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, they have to spend time to study the Word together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, the co-workers should meet with the responsible brothers at least once a week to fellowship about the affairs related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In principle, the best way to have the bread-breaking meeting is by districts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The districts should come together once a month at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If workers have a financial need, they should not look to man's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps they should look for a part-time job.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is what some people are practicing in the mainland today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At present, the government of the People's Republic has introduced the so-called "Common Policy."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It points out four main classes of people: 1 small bourgeois, 2 farmers, 3 nationalistic bourgeois, and 4 workers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These four groups are combined together to run the government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the so-called "coalition government of the four classes."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is an imitation of the principle of having all things in common as described in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no party and no special interest group.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The whole nation is involved in production, and all the products go to the state.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to meet by districts, we have to look for suitable places.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once we find a suitable place, we can rent it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church can rent the living room for meeting, while the brothers and sisters can rent the rooms for boarding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can have prayer meetings, bread-breaking meetings, young people's edification meetings, and gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Due to the change in political conditions, there is an overabundance of civil workers and bureaucrats in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All of them do not work on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the best time for us to preach the gospel is on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I strongly support using the Lord's Day morning as a time for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will deliver us from the habit of attending a so-called Sunday-morning service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Workers of the Lord should not be afraid of having too many people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, our fear should be that the people will not come.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If more people come, we can start a new meeting in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The workers should have the proper concept that they are not professional preachers; they do not receive a regular salary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible never says that God's workers should receive a salary from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church does not pay me to do the work of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am called by God, and I can only look to Him for His provision.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was Paul's way when he said, "If I do this of my own will, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with a stewardship" 1 Cor 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The work of a worker is to fulfill the ministry he has received from God, and this ministry is always for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is not for the ministry; rather, the ministry is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A worker should not work with the intention of bringing the church under the control of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the contrary, a worker should serve under the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether one is an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, a shepherd, or a teacher, all work is for perfecting others with the goal that all the brothers and sisters would be able to do what the gifted ones can do Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today there are four thousand people who have turned to the Lord in Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A few workers cannot possibly visit them all.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Others must be perfected to do the job.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Shanghai there are now over seven hundred brothers and sisters who are unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even at ordinary times there are two to three hundred unemployed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Perhaps the recent turbulence is actually an interim period that the Lord has provided for us to mobilize the unemployed ones to visit the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not preach the gospel to those who are under eighteen years of age now, it will be hard to work on them after four years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The embryonic stage of the gospel in China was from 1918 to 1922.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During this period, the Lord raised up many young lovers of Him in China.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Most of them were under twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I was saved in 1920 at the age of seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Four years later, I would have been in America for my studies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In preaching the gospel, we should not decide how old one should be before he can believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With the political situation changing by the minute, we have to be on the alert even more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The years of 1948 to 1952 may be another period of witnessing the Lord's revival.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we miss this time, it will be hard for us to make it up later.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Soviet Union the number of believers increased thirty times during the twelve years between 1918 and 1929.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>During the same time period, Russia's history became very turbulent.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Similarly, I am asking you to do the seemingly impossible during this hour of trial.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Throughout history, Christians have always been the ones who seized every opportunity to make gains for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They have always accomplished impossible tasks.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the mainland, the People's Republic is discouraging gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are doing our best not to stir them up.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We work quietly on people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord has placed the gospel work of China in our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we work harder and stronger, sooner or later He will gain this land.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should try our best to obey, labor, and work with our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should pray much for wisdom from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Time is short.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We do not know when we will lose our opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everywhere in Southeast Asia there are religious restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>British law in Singapore does not allow anyone to preach outdoors.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Preaching the gospel in Malaysia is a criminal offense, with the government emphasizing its respect for the religious freedom of the Malaysians.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do not expect these governments to give us any help.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, do not stir them up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should not do anything to purposely demonstrate our zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Instead, exercise wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In east China, the number has multiplied a few fold in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Among all the provinces in China, Chekiang has the most promising work; the number of churches there is in the hundreds rather than in the tens.</S>
