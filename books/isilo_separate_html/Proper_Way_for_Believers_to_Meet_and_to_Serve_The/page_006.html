<h1 class="title">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:4; Eph. 5:18-19; Acts 6:5a; 13:52; 2:4a, 17a, 33; 4:31; 13:9</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You with all our heart, and we offer our thanksgiving and praise to You. Visit us day by day, and lead us moment by moment. We believe that You have called us out of our preoccupations and have gathered us into Your name for this meeting. We are meeting in Your precious, great, exalted, and rich name to enjoy You. Lord, come and visit us; touch every heart, open every spirit, and enlighten every mind so that we may hear with understanding and see a clear vision. Open the heavens to us. Give us a clear sky without any shadows, and remove our darkness. May Your Spirit fill this place and move in us.</p>
<p>Lord, we ask that You touch our deepest part so that we may know You, enjoy You, and be filled with You in our daily Christian life. Support our listening and our speaking. Give us instant utterance, and enable us to speak words that release You. Lord, dispense Yourself into us. We need You. Lord, we do not need religion, philosophy, doctrine, or mere words; we need You, the living God, the true and living Lord, and the Spirit who penetrates everything and is everywhere. May we gain You in this meeting, and may none of us go away empty-handed; rather, may we be satisfied. We give the glory to You. Shame Your enemy, and bless all of us who have called on You and are saved. In Your name we pray, Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Salvation is different from religion and philosophy, including Chinese ethical philosophy. Salvation is God dwelling in the believers as their life. Religion and philosophy are merely knowledge and doctrine. They are the highest things in human culture, and religion is noble. Human history proves that philosophy, particularly Chinese ethical philosophy, is beneficial to society; however, both philosophy and religion differ from the gospel of God and His salvation. Although this salvation contains certain truths and explains certain doctrines, salvation involves a living person&mdash;the Triune God who was incarnated to be our Savior. Objectively, this Savior was crucified on our behalf to bear our sins and to accomplish redemption so that our sins may be forgiven by God. This point is widely preached in Christianity.</p>
<p>However, salvation has not only an objective aspect but also a subjective aspect. The New Testament speaks of the two &ldquo;becomings&rdquo; of the Triune God. The first is the Word becoming flesh, that is, the Triune God becoming flesh, partaking of blood and flesh (John 1:14; Heb. 2:14), and thus being able to go to the cross to die and accomplish redemption (John 19:30; Heb. 9:22, 12). Afterward, He was resurrected from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit. This is the second becoming. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; This is a crucial item that is neglected by Christianity. Christ is God becoming flesh; hence, Christ is also a man. As God yet man, He went to the cross to shed human blood in order to accomplish redemption and wash away our sins. After the cross He went into death, even into Hades, and remained there for three days and three nights, and then He came out. His coming out of death was His resurrection. In His resurrection there was a second becoming; that is, He became the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAST ADAM<br />
BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our Savior is Jesus Christ, the true God and our Lord. He is also the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit. As such, He can enter into our spirit. When He was in the flesh on earth, He was with the disciples, but He could only be among them; He could not enter into them. Therefore, He had to suffer death and be resurrected. Through His death and resurrection He was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit, becoming the life-giving Spirit. When He returned to the disciples on the evening of the day of His resurrection, He breathed into them. When I read this portion of the Bible as a young man, I thought that Christ should have spoken extensively to His disciples concerning His death and resurrection: how He passed through death, took a tour of Hades, overcame death, was not held by death, and walked out of death and how in resurrection He is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. Yet surprisingly, in John 20 when Christ came to meet with His disciples after His resurrection, He spoke only a few words, mainly saying, &ldquo;Peace be to you,&rdquo; and then He breathed into them (vv. 19, 22). This sounds like a fairy tale; it does not seem appropriate for a classic writing, much less the teachings in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>Prior to the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, the disciples had been sorrowful for three days because their dearly beloved Lord, Jesus Christ, had been killed and buried in a tomb. They were exceedingly grieved and distressed. Although the doors were shut, the Lord suddenly stood in their midst and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be to you.&rdquo; While the disciples were still in shock, He breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). <em>Breath</em> and <em>Spirit</em> are two different words in English, but in Greek they are the same word. The anglicized form of this word is <em>pneuma,</em> and its adjectival form is <em>pneumatic.</em> The Greek word may be rendered as &ldquo;wind,&rdquo; &ldquo;breath,&rdquo; or &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in English. In John 3 it is rendered as &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;wind&rdquo; (vv. 5, 8). The wind can be gentle for us to breath, or it can be strong. After His resurrection the Lord Jesus came to His disciples and breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In other words, He breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Pneuma.&rdquo; It is correct to render this as &ldquo;Receive the Holy Breath,&rdquo; because in Greek the word for <em>spirit</em> and for <em>breath</em> is the same.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is God, and God is Spirit. He became flesh, partaking of blood and flesh, and went to the cross to die on our behalf. However, He did not remain in death. He came out of death and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He was transfigured into pneuma. This word can be rendered as &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;air,&rdquo; or &ldquo;breath.&rdquo; Hence, He is now the pneumatic Christ; He is the Spirit.</p>
<p>Bible readers know that the Scriptures often use visible, physical matters to describe invisible, mysterious, spiritual, and profound matters. It is difficult to understand a statement such as, &ldquo;The atmosphere is filled with spirit.&rdquo; However, we can understand a statement such as, &ldquo;The atmosphere is filled with air.&rdquo; There is air in this room, in my home, and even in me. We would die without air. The atmosphere, the air surrounding the earth, provides the earth with an environment that is suitable for every kind of life to grow. When man landed on the moon, there was no air there; therefore, there were no living things there as well. The air typifies our Savior, the incarnated God, who went through death and resurrection to become the mysterious breath, the Spirit, who is omnipresent. Romans 10:6-7 says, &ldquo;Do not say in your heart, &lsquo;Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ down; or, &lsquo;Who will descend into the abyss?&rsquo; that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.&rdquo; We do not need to say this, because Christ has already come down from heaven, and He has already come up out of Hades. He is the word that we proclaim, and this word &ldquo;is near you, in your mouth and in your heart&rdquo; (v. 8). As the word, the Lord is like the air, the breath; He is near us, in our mouth and in our heart.</p>
<p>The Bible uses air to portray the incarnated God, who came to be our Savior in order to accomplish redemption and thereafter became the wonderful Spirit. This Spirit is the &ldquo;air&rdquo; in the universe. Without air, the universe cannot have life. Without our Savior, man is lifeless, for he lives in death. Our Savior is the air, the breath, the Spirit. In John 7:39 the word <em>the</em> in the phrase <em>the Spirit</em> is an emphatic, definite article in the original language. &ldquo;The Spirit&rdquo; refers to the unique Spirit in the universe. Only this Spirit is the Spirit of life. Any other &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; cannot give life. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and Romans 8:2 says that He is the Spirit of life. The Spirit is God and Christ. When we say the Lord&rsquo;s name, He immediately comes into us. His name denotes His person, which is the Spirit. Therefore, whenever we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, He comes to us immediately, because He is the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
