[1]  The Bible speaks of Christ as our life in many ways.
[2]  Putting it another way, this verse speaks of how we are in Christ and also how Christ is in us.
[3]  If we have the life of Christ but do not know how this life has become our life, we cannot be a proper Christian and readily manifest His life.
[4]  God first put us into Christ, and then put Christ into us.
[5]  If we do not have a relationship with Christ, we cannot have Christ come into us to be our life.
[6]  What does it mean for us to be in Christ?
[7]  "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."
[8]  The church announces to men this earth-shaking fact, that God has put men into Christ; when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, God judged Him, and men were also judged in Him.
[9]  In other words, God has put us into Christ, but we have to do something to show others that we are in Christ.
[10]  Now we will speak on Christ being in us.
[11]  God has not given us Christ so that He could just die for us on the cross; He has given Christ to us to be our life.
[12]  Originally, we react to all the demands that are outside of us by exercising our own life; we act according to our own life.
[13]  After understanding the meaning of Christ being our life, we now come to the question of Christ becoming our wisdom from God.
[14]  Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."
[15]  God has not changed foolish men into wise; rather, He has made Christ our wisdom; Christ has become wisdom to us from God.
[16]  If we did not have to stand before God, the question of righteousness would not come in. Once we think about God, we think of righteousness.
[17]  When Christ becomes our life within, He responds to all the demands outside of us.
[18]  When pride comes, Christ is manifested as our humility.
[19]  Not only has Christ become righteousness to us from God, and not only has He become sanctification to us from God, but He has become redemption to us from God.
[20]  When a man comes to God through Christ, God will no longer condemn him, because Christ has satisfied God's righteous requirement on man's behalf.
[21]  Christ is not only our redemption before God; He is also redemption within us.
[22]  Christ as our redemption within not only delivers us from the law of sin in our members Rom 7:23; 8:2 , but has become life to our body.
[23]  Romans 8:11 says, "And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."
[24]  First Corinthians 15:42-44 shows us that when a Christian dies, he is not buried, but is "sown."
[25]  May the Lord open our eyes to see that God has put us into Christ and made Christ our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[26]  We have to learn to know Christ as our righteousness, we have to learn to know Christ as our sanctification, and we have to learn to know Christ as our redemption.
