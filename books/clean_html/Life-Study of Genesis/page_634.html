As such a representative, Joseph typifies Christ, for the reigning aspect of the mature life is Christ constituted into our being. Therefore, in the record of Genesis Joseph typifies Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(7) Betrayed</H2><P>We have seen that Joseph typifies Christ as the beloved Son of God, as the One sent by God the Father to shepherd God's people, and as the One who was persecuted by those whom He was sent to shepherd. In addition, according to the four Gospels, Christ was betrayed (Matt. 26:14-16). Joseph, as a type of Christ, also was betrayed (Gen. 37:27-28). In the Bible sense, to be betrayed means to be despised, depreciated, dishonored, or disregarded. When Judas was about to sell Christ, he certainly was lowering down the value of Christ to the uttermost. In Matthew 26 we see that Christ was a test to all those around Him. Some hated Him. Mary, however, appreciated Him and poured valuable ointment upon Him. To Mary, Christ was valuable, and she highly appreciated Him. But Judas despised Christ, dishonored Him, and disregarded Him. He depreciated Christ to such a degree that he sold Him for a cheap price, for thirty pieces of silver, which according to Exodus was the price of a slave (Exo. 21:32). Thus, in the Bible to betray someone means to depreciate him.</P><P>Whenever you are depreciated by someone, it means that you are betrayed by him. Whenever your wife depreciates you, she is betraying you. Likewise, if the brothers disregard you, it means that you have been betrayed. Consider how you evaluate yourself. In your thinking are you not valuable? We all regard ourselves as valuable. Therefore, when we are depreciated by others or disregarded by them, we are betrayed. You may think that during the years you have been in the church life you have never seen a betrayal. However, in the church life people are often betrayed in the sense of being disregarded or depreciated. Day after day, husbands may depreciate their wives or wives may disregard their husbands. If some saints talk about another saint in a depreciating way, they are betraying him.</P><P>We all think of ourselves as valuable. In actuality we are valuable because we have Christ in us. Do you not have God within you? In the Bible God is likened to gold, and Christ is likened to a treasure. Our God is the gold within us, and Christ within us is the treasure in the vessel. The unbelievers do not have such a high value because they do not have Christ within them. At most, they are simply muddy vessels. But we have the greatest treasure within us. Therefore, we should not think that we are not valuable. We need to declare to the angels, "Angels, you must realize how valuable I am. I'm valuable because Christ is in me." Furthermore, you may boast to Satan and to the demons, "Satan, I want you to know that I have God and Christ within me. Demons, you are not destined to have Christ in you. But I have Christ in me and therefore I am valuable." This is not pride; on the contrary, it is true humility. I would like to tell everyone, including the angels, the Devil, the demons, and everyone on earth, that I am valuable because I have Christ; therefore, you must not despise me or disregard me.</P><P>We must learn not to sell our brothers. Joseph was sold by his brothers. If they had regarded him as a sheaf or a star, they would not have sold him. The fact that they betrayed Joseph means that they depreciated him and disregarded him. In principle, the same thing happened to the Lord Jesus. Although He was precious and valuable, Judas depreciated Him and sold Him for thirty pieces of silver. Peter, James, John, and all the other Apostles followed the footsteps of the Lamb, and they also were depreciated. This was also true of the Apostle Paul. Throughout the centuries, the followers of the Lamb have been betrayed. Like Christ, they have been depreciated, disregarded, and despised. As we follow the Lord today, we also are being depreciated. We endure many sufferings simply because we are despised and disregarded. Those who oppose us depreciate us and disregard us. If they appreciated the treasure within us and recognized the preciousness of what the Lord has wrought into us, they would neither despise us nor disregard us. Certain ones oppose us because they depreciate us. This depreciation is actually a form of selling us, and it is a sign of betrayal. Do not think that such a betrayal happened only to Joseph or to Christ as typified by Joseph. On the contrary, it has happened to all the followers of Christ and it is our experience today.</P><P>Before we were saved, many of us were highly regarded by our parents, relatives, and friends. But after we were saved and began to seek the Lord, our friends, relatives, and in some cases even our parents began to despise us. This is betrayal. Christ's crucifixion began with His betrayal. He was crucified after He was betrayed. It was the same in principle with Joseph. He was not directly cast into prison. First he was sold, and his being sold was the stepping-stone into prison. Christ's betrayal was the stepping-stone to the cross. It is not an insignificant matter to be betrayed. All the persecution and opposition today is a type of betrayal. Those who oppose us are betraying us; they are selling us at a cheap price. Although we are valuable, the opposers sell us for such a low price, even for nothing.</P>
