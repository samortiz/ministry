   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>K. The Spiritual Significance, in Typology,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of Solomon and the Temple He Built for God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Solomon typifies Christ Matt 12:42 in speaking God's word of wisdom 13:35 and in building the church as the temple of God 16:18; 1 Cor 3:16; Eph 2:21-22 , and the temple typifies Christ Matt 12:6 and the church as the unique building of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two Christ and His Body, the church are the center, the reality, and the goal of God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since Solomon and the temple built by him play the strongest roles in the history of Israel and occupy a wide realm in such a history, they are the strong evidence that the history of Israel concerns very much the fulfillment of God's eternal economy in the Old Testament in the way of typology.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our study of such a history is detached from the economy of God, our study will be a labor in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That Christ and the church are the centrality and universality of God's economy is universal in both the New Testament and the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to see clearly that the books of history were written from the point of view of God's eternal economy concerning Christ and the church.</S>
