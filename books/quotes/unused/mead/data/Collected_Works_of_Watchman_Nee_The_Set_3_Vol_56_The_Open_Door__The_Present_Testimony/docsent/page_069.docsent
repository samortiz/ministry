   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Five</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Oh, that blessing might flow from us as it flowed from Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that there will soon be a great turn in the gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May the Lord bless us and have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>May we regard blessing as if we were accustomed to receiving it constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not want to frustrate God from blessing us greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The salvation of one thousand people may hinder the salvation of tens of thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps the salvation of a few score people in one place is a hindrance to the salvation of several thousand others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each time we receive one blessing, we should expect to receive a second blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must continuously step into greater blessings from God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Each of our co-workers must look to God to do a work among us such as He has never done before.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Immediately before us lies a work that is ten times greater, even one hundred times greater, than that which is behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is it possible that the few people who have been saved and the meeting hall we have built have become the limits of our blessing?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the past the work constantly grew, but now we have tied it up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our past blessings have become our present frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is very pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Each time we come before God, we must be like we were the first time we came out to work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some have been working for twenty years, yet they seem like those who are new to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some have been working for thirty years, but they seem like they are new in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must set the things of the past aside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In difficult situations God will do more if our hopes, expectations, and hearts are large.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must never measure God by our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A few loaves of bread can feed four or five thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the blessing is large, nothing can hinder it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we who serve the Lord truly look for God's blessing when we gather together, the future results will be more than we can ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Six</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's blessing is like a bird that will only fly from the outside into a room by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When it is at the window, we cannot call it to come in. If it comes in, however, it is very easy to chase away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God will bless what He wants to bless; we cannot force Him to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Like the bird, it is difficult to lure in and easy to chase away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With just a little carelessness, we can chase the blessing away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Over the past two or three years, I have observed our co-workers doing many things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One co-worker said something to another co-worker, and they had an argument.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was absolutely right in what he said and did, but in my heart, I wanted to say, "Brother, you are right, but should we behave according to right and wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Or should we behave according to what will bring in God's blessing?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We often may do something right, but what can we do if God does not bless us when we do things right?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not ask whether our every action is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, we should ask whether we have God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not here to argue about right and wrong; we are here to ask God to bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Seeking God's blessing on our work will limit us much in our speaking and in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may be right, but will God bless us?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is very easy for us to cut off our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is also very easy to cut off the blessing of others as well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our standard is not right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We look for God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Both may be right, but can God bless such a work?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our lives must be governed by God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In God's work He will not bless what is wrong, but He will not bless what is right either.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we stand together in one accord, the blessing comes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, I want us to know that it is a very serious matter when the brothers argue with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may be absolutely right in the matter, but the blessing will stop!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers, let me solemnly warn about speaking loosely or thinking that it is good enough just to be right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The brothers have to be careful about speaking among themselves and criticizing one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It does not matter if we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are right and God does not bless us, what is the use of being right?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The work is not built upon our abilities, nor is it built upon our gifts, faithfulness, or labor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we miss God's blessing, everything is finished.</S>
