At that time, a booklet authored by Robert and Gretchen Passantino from The Christian Research Institute (CRI) raised the charge of modalism against Witness Lee and the local churches. Ron Kangas answered that charge in this informative booklet. His work is more than an answer to a false accusation; it is an education on the heretical and proper views of the Triune God.<p>The booklet is being reprinted as part of a series of publications, Contending for the Faith, concerning our faith and the contention that has taken place over it. We hope that seeking people will take the time to search and know the truth of God&#8217;s Word, rather than listening to rumors or evil reports. This booklet on God in Trinity is especially needed now because those authors who first made the charge of modalism and the Christian Research Institute have ignored its first printing. They continue to raise the same false accusations in their subsequent publications, The Teachings of Witness Lee and the Local Church (1978), a tape authored by Walter Martin, Witness Lee and the Local Church (1977), and the book The New Cults (1980). The clear denial of the accusation of modalism, reprinted here, was deliberately ignored by those authors.<p>We offer this booklet to the public to read and judge the truth for themselves. God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him (Heb. 11:6). May the study of the truth lead every reader to a fresh appreciation of the God who is our Creator, our Redeemer, and our life.<p>Dan Towle Anaheim, California January 1994<h1 class=msg></h1><h1 class=msg>MODALISM, TRITHEISM, OR THE PURE REVELATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE</h1><p>The purpose of this booklet is to provide the general Christian public with a clear and simple presentation of three views concerning the Triune God: modalism, tritheism, and the pure revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible. By having a basic understanding of modalism and tritheism and by seeing the pure revelation of the Triune God in the Scriptures, the Lord&#8217;s people should be able to discern and avoid the heretical extremes of modalism and tritheism, grasp the whole truth of God&#8217;s revelation in the Scriptures, and pursue more readily the experience of the Triune God according to His eternal purpose.<h2 class=head1>MODALISM</h2><h2 class=head2>Some Definitions</h2><p>Let us begin with modalism. Because this term is unfamiliar to many Christians, we need to define four words-mode, modal, modalism, and modalist. According to its philosophical meaning, a mode denotes the appearance or form assumed by a thing; it refers to the manifestation, form, or manner of arrangement of some underlying substance. The adjective modal specifies the mode of a thing as distinguished from its substance or essence. Modalism is the theological doctrine that the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three distinct Persons, but rather three modes or forms of activity under which God manifests Himself. A modalist is an adherent of the theological doctrine of modalism.<br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
