   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Different from Our Baptism into Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 6:3 and Galatians 3:27 speak of being baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is different from the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be baptized into Christ refers to our baptism in water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we were born in Adam, through faith and baptism we came out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the King James Version, John 3:16 speaks of believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Greek preposition here is better translated into, as in Romans 6:3, in which Paul tells us that we have been "baptized into Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We believe into Christ and are baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We get into Christ by faith and baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The real meaning of water baptism is death and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the positive side, faith indicates that we are one with Christ, while on the negative side, baptism indicates that we are dead to Adam and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not saved by baptism in water alone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Salvation by the water of baptism alone is a superstition similar in principle to the teaching of the Catholic Church that the bread and wine of the Lord's table become the actual body and blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, baptism by water is a symbol that we are identified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the death and resurrection of Christ implied by the water of baptism that saves us, not the water of baptism in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, there are two kinds of baptism the baptism with water and the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Baptism by water is a burial, a thorough clearance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The best clearance that we can have is to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we are buried, all natural relationships, bondage, and other negative matters are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 6:3 and 4 show us the proper meaning of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is to be buried with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit, however, is an inauguration, which is something positive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Inauguration is related to power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although we are identified with Christ by baptism in water, we are not inaugurated by baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were baptized in water as a symbol that we died with Christ and were buried and resurrected with Him, but this is a matter of life not of power or authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapters six, seven, and eight of Romans, there is no mention of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not until we come to chapter twelve that we have the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The baptism in the Holy Spirit is a matter of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Body of Christ as the church was inaugurated by the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE WAY TO EXPERIENCE THE TRIUNE GOD WITHIN US AND UPON US</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the resurrection of Christ, the Triune God has come into us as our very life for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, in His ascension this very Triune God has come down upon the Body of Christ as authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now we must experience this full authority by keeping a proper relationship with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be right with the Body, stand with the Body, live in the Body, and act in the Body and for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we have the ground, the position, to pray and claim whatever has been accomplished on the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now whatever has been accomplished on the Body is our inheritance, our heritage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We simply enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is our life within and power without.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is for our inward regeneration and our outward inauguration with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the day of Pentecost, there is now a group of persons on the earth who have the Triune God within them as their life and upon them as their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They live by this divine life within, and they act, move, and work by this authority without.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This group of people is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have this vision, it will be easy to have a living and prevailing faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we need power, since we are in the Body and for the Body, we have the position to claim as our portion whatever the Head has accomplished for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may claim whatever we need for our experience.</S>
