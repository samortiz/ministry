[1]  The Excelling Gift for the Building Up of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE EXCELLING GIFT Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 7a, 9, 13a, 18, 23-24, 30; 2:2; 3:6, 9-14; 5:7-8; 6:17; 10:3-4, 16-17; 11:24-26; 12:1-11, 13b, 31a; 14:1, 3-5, 12, 19, 24-25, 31, 39a; 15:45b
[3]  For our past we need Christ as our righteousness, for our present we need Him as our sanctification, and for our future we need Him as our redemption for the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 , the transfiguration of our body Phil 3:21 .
[4]  As the enjoyment of Christ solves our problems by taking away the negative elements within us, there can be the growth in life.
[5]  The issue of our enjoyment of Christ is the growth in life, producing precious materials for the building up of the church 3:6, 9-14 .
[6]  The very purpose for God to fill us with Christ is to make us grow, and the growth in life is for the producing of precious materials gold, silver, and precious stones for the building up of the church.
[7]  If we love the Lord and we mean business with Him, day by day we will learn to experience Him by enjoying Him.
[8]  First Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we come together, each one has something of the Lord to share with the other attendants in the meeting for the building up of the church.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO DESIRING AND LEARNING TO PROPHESY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:12; 12:31a; 14:1, 39, 31; 2 Tim 3:16-17; Gal 5:16, 25; 1 Thes 5:17-20; Prov 4:18; Lam 3:22-24; Psa 119:147-148; Rev 21:7; 1 John 1:6; Rom 8:4b; 2 Tim 4:2a
[10]  Prayer: Lord, again we ask You to cleanse us with Your precious blood that we may enter into the enjoyment of Your anointing.
[11]  Lord, open up the Word and open up Yourself to us.
[12]  Lord, visit us and give us Your living word.
[13]  In chapter one we saw that 1 Corinthians is a book on the enjoyment of Christ and that the enjoyment of Christ does three things.
[14]  Second, the enjoyment of Christ issues in the growth in life which produces precious materials gold, silver, and precious stones for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.
[15]  We cannot change the truth of the Scriptures, the Lord Jesus, and God s salvation, but we must change the way we minister the word of truth and practice the church life to the scriptural way, the God-ordained way, which is the best way.
[16]  To meet according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, we must desire and learn to prophesy.
[17]  If we say something for others to learn, we have to learn first.
[18]  The saints need to be perfected to enjoy the Lord, to be saturated with the Word, to pray unceasingly, to fellowship with the Lord moment by moment, to walk in the Spirit, and to speak the Lord in the Spirit at all times.
[19]  CHAPTER THREE THROUGH EVERY JOINT OF THE RICH SUPPLY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-16
[20]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this gathering, and we thank You for Your cleansing.
[21]  Lord, have mercy upon us and unveil Yourself to us.
[22]  Lord, give us a clear sky that we all may see something in the heavens, something on Your heart, and something in Your Spirit.
[23]  Lord, speak a word to each one of us and unveil the mystery of Yourself, of Your plan, of Your economy, and of Your Body to all of us.
[24]  In this chapter we want to see that all the Body of Christ causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself through every joint of the rich supply.
[25]  We must admit that even among us in the Lord s recovery, we cannot see much of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God.
[26]  Verses 11 and 12 say that Christ has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[27]  Verses 15 and 16 say: But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[28]  Ephesians 4 tells us that the Lord gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers.
[29]  According to our thinking, an apostle establishes churches with elders, a prophet speaks for the Lord, an evangelist has campaigns for the preaching of the gospel, and the shepherd-teachers shepherd and teach the saints.
[30]  In Ephesians 4 Paul gives us the teaching of the perfecting of the saints, and in Acts 20 there is a record of how he perfected the saints.
[31]  Not only did he write concerning the Body of Christ in the book of Ephesians, but he also should have taught this to the Ephesian saints publicly in big meetings and in their homes.
[32]  We need to realize that all of us as members of the Body of Christ have a measure and that we all need to operate according to our measure.
[33]  In chapters one and two, I talked about prophesying as the excelling gift for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[34]  This implies that we must be persons who are always communicating with the Lord, who are living in the Lord s fellowship.
[35]  In this chapter we want to have more fellowship concerning how the Body of Christ causes itself to grow unto the building up of itself.
[36]  It tells us that the ascended Christ in all His qualifications and in His position as the Head in the heavens, gave His church some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers.
[37]  To perfect the saints, we have to help them hold to truth Eph 4:15 , to hold to the real and true things in this universe.
[38]  Only God, Christ, and the organic Body of Christ are real.
[39]  When we leave the truth and pay attention to things other than God, Christ, and the Body of Christ, there will be problems.
[40]  To have more of Christ added into us means that we are growing not only in Christ but also into Christ in all things.
[41]  We must have Christ increasingly added into us so that we may have the growth in Christ as life.
[42]  Out from the Head, the whole Body of Christ causes the growth of the Body through two means: the first category of the members of Christ and the second category of the members of Christ.
[43]  Of course, we need a job to take care of our livelihood, but in our leisure time on weekday evenings and on the weekend, we can operate to build up the Body of Christ by knocking on people s doors to bring them the Lord s salvation.
[44]  HOW THE BODY OF CHRIST CAN BE BUILT UP
[45]  In Ephesians 4:11-16 we can see a clear picture of how the Body of Christ can be built up.
[46]  It can only be built up by all the Body of Christ causing the growth of the Body.
[47]  All the Body of Christ is joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part.
[48]  Acts shows us that the saints did the following things in their homes: they had the Lord s table, they had fellowship, they preached Christ as the gospel, they taught the truths, and they prayed Acts 2:42, 46; 5:42 .
[49]  As we have seen in chapter three, to learn how to prophesy we have to learn the Word and live in fellowship with the Lord so that we can have the instant inspiration of the Triune God at any time.
[50]  CHAPTER FIVE THE PATTERNS OF PERFECTING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-12; 1 Thes 2:6-8, 11-12; John 21:15-17; Matt 28:20; 1 Cor 14:3-4, 24-25; Acts 20:17-21, 24, 27-28, 31; 8:4-5, 12, 26-38
[51]  In this chapter we need to be impressed that the Lord needs to recover the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry.
[52]  Christ s desire, as He promised in Matthew 16:18, is to build up the church which is His Body.
[53]  The apostles establish churches, the prophets speak for the Lord, the evangelists preach the gospel, and the shepherds and teachers shepherd the church and teach the saints.
[54]  Those of us who have been in the church life for a number of years may have become old, so we all need to have a new start.
[55]  To practice the biblical way, we have to begin every morning with the Lord to get ourselves revived anew Lam 3:22-23 .
[56]  In the recent winter training on Leviticus, we saw from Leviticus 27 that the Lord desires that we devote all that we are and have to Him.
[57]  If we are going to devote ourselves to the Lord for His biblical way, we have to visit people.
[58]  We should at least have a prayer meeting during the week and attend the church meeting on the Lord s Day in order to have the Lord s table and the speaking for the Lord.
[59]  The majority of the saints will be the most free on the Lord s Day, so we need to have a church gathering, but not with a big group.
[60]  The gifted persons were given by the Lord to His Body for the perfecting of the saints.
[61]  I believe that there are a number of gifted persons among us who need to rise up to perfect the saints.
[62]  In the Lord s recovery there must be a practical move in which many gifted persons are perfecting the saints, and eventually many saints are perfecting others.
[63]  He told them to remember how he was with them for three years, admonishing all the saints day and night with tears v. 31 . He said that he did not shrink from declaring to them all the counsel of God v. 27 . He also reminded them that he taught them publicly and from house to house v. 20 . This was how the Apostle Paul perfected the saints.
[64]  The Lord s conversation with Peter in John 21:15-17 indicates that if we love the Lord, we must feed His lambs, shepherd His sheep, and feed His sheep.
[65]  I hope that many of us will make a vow with the Lord to devote six hours weekly to the Lord to walk in the biblical way so that the Lord will have a way to build up His organic Body.
[66]  Matthew begins with the genealogy of Jesus Christ, which is difficult to understand, but John begins in a simpler way In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God v. 1 . Verse 4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men, and verse 14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace.... We may not fully understand these verses, but these words are sweet and precious to us.
[67]  In 1984 I realized that the Lord s recovery had nearly come to a standstill.
[68]  Now that we have been saved by the Lord, we may only want to come to the meetings for our enjoyment.
[69]  In the New Testament, the Lord first called us to Himself, and then He sent us to preach the gospel, to disciple the nations.
[70]  We may have the concept that the Lord would never ask us to do such a hard thing as to go out to visit people for preaching the gospel, but the New Testament shows that we have to be prepared to be persecuted and even martyred for the preaching of the gospel.
[71]  If we go out to visit people for the preaching of the gospel, outwardly we are doing something difficult; but in going out to visit people for the gospel, we will participate in the Triune God much more than we ever did before.
[72]  Paul is a pattern of a person who was desperate and diligent in cooperating with the Lord to carry out His desire for the organic building up of the Body of Christ 1 Tim 1:16; Eph 3:8 .
