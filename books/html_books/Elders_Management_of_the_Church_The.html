The center of the church is the elders. This shows us the importance of the position of the elders. The management of the elders in a church is a matter that should not be underestimated. Due to my ignorance in the matter, I have served as a misguided elder for over twenty years. It was not until 1960 when I attended Brother Witness Lee's training that I heard for the first time the secret to the elders' management of the church. These lessons are the culmination of Brother Lee's many years of practical experience and involvement in church management based on biblical principles. The subjects covered are definite, detailed, and practical. They were first used by the church in Peitou, which studied these lessons twice in their service meetings and witnessed rich results. Last January, Hall One of the church in Taipei made mimeographed copies of notes of these meetings and studied them in the responsible brothers' meetings throughout all the districts. They left a deep impression on the brothers and brought about very much progress in their service and coordination.</P><P>Recently after Brother Chang Wu-cheng and I visited twenty-four local churches throughout the province, we felt that the study of the elders' management of the church is a desperate need of the churches today. I take the opportunity of the publishing of this book to encourage all my co-elders to study these lessons together with the responsible ones of their districts and to practice these lessons together. This will render great help to the management of the church, to the coordination of the elders and the deacons, and to the producing of useful people. By this, the Lord will gain a more open way among us. May the Lord accomplish this aspiration!</P><P>Chang Yu-lan in Taipei<br>July, 1963</P></td></tr></table></div><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KNOWLEDGE OF AN ELDER</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 5:17; 3:5; Acts 20:17, 28</H1><P>All the verses that we have just read show us that the church is managed by the elders. The light concerning the elders' administration of the church has been received and practiced by us for many years. Thank the Lord that during the past years, not only has the Lord set up many local churches, but He has set up a number of elders in each local church. This has been especially true in many places in Taiwan during the past ten years. Everywhere, brothers who love the Lord, who are willing to pay the price, and who are concerned for the Lord's children have been raised up to manage the house of God with diligence and faithfulness. We cannot help but bow down to worship the Lord for this.</P><P>However, although these brothers have been constrained by the Lord's love to manage the house of God, due to the fact that they have never done this before, they are at a loss both in their understanding of the biblical principles and, in addition, in their practice as to how to manage the church. The worldly method has indeed been rejected, and the natural wisdom has been reckoned worthless. But where is the proper way for the management of a church? For this reason, the brothers serving as elders in the different places have often come to me to express their frustrations. They begged me to say something concerning the matter of the management of the church. This cry has become all the more urgent as the number of churches is multiplying rapidly.</P><P>For this reason, I deeply feel that I should take this opportunity at this time, when most of the elders are here, to consider this matter in a thorough way. Perhaps this will help the management of the churches in all the places. Of course, due to the limitation in time, we cannot take care of every aspect. We can only point out the most important subjects and cover them in fifteen chapters.</P><P>In the first message, we will begin by covering the matter of the knowledge of an elder&#151;what an elder has to know. Although this title is very simple, what it entails is very broad. There are many, many things that an elder has to know. We cannot cover all of the items. We will bring out only a few items that are related particularly to the elders' management of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. GOD'S PLAN FOR THE CHURCH</H2><P>The first thing that the elders should know is God's plan for the church. In order for an elder to manage a church properly, obviously he must first of all know God's desire and plan for the church. If the elders lack knowledge in this matter, their administration of the church will surely be unsatisfactory both to others and to God. Although many elders are faithfully and diligently serving the church, their oversight of the church is often unsatisfactory to God because they do not have adequate knowledge concerning God's plan for the church. Why does God want to have a church on earth? Why is it that in the New Testament age God desires to set up churches in every locality? If the elders are not clear concerning this vision and revelation and are not definite concerning this goal, it will be difficult to proceed with anything else in a proper way.</P><P>It is not enough for an elder to feel that since the Lord has granted him mercy and has set him up as one caring for the church, he would readily accept this arrangement of the Lord and would henceforth serve faithfully and diligently. This attitude is indeed commendable, but as far as knowledge is concerned, it is still very inadequate. An elder must have a very clear revelation and thorough vision concerning the position, the importance, the process, and the consummation of the church in God's plan. Only then will he know what the church is that he is managing, and what is its position and nature. Only when an elder acquires such knowledge will his management be up to God's standard.</P><P>God's plan for the church is a big subject. We have to point out this matter in a brief way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God Desires to Have a Body<br>for the Expression of His Son</H2><P>First, we must know that from eternity past God has desired to have a Body for the expression of His Son. In other words, God desires to gain a Body for His Son, and this Body is for the expression of His Son. The Bible shows us that the Son of God is very great, full, abundant, and rich. Everything that God is, is in His Son. The more you read the Bible, the more you feel the fullness and the abundance of God Himself; they are truly unlimited. His love is an unlimited fullness. His wisdom is an unlimited fullness. His glory is an unlimited fullness. His power is an unlimited fullness. All that He is in Himself is unlimited fullness. This is beyond man's imagination and measurement. According to Colossians chapter two, all this fullness of God dwells in His Son Christ bodily. For this reason, God desires to have a Body for His full Christ, so that all the fullness can be manifested in the whole universe. This Body is the church. Hence, God plans to have a church for no other reason than for it to be the Body of His Son in the universe, so that His Son can have a full expression in and through this Body.</P><P>Brothers, if you see this vision, it will be a tremendous deliverance for you. You will be delivered from the common religious concept of Christianity. Many Christians think that to believe in the Lord is for deliverance from hell so that they can go to heaven: if anyone fears God today and pleases Him, he will be blessed and will receive peace and prosperity. Some Christians have further knowledge; they realize that a person has to be zealous, to love the Lord, and to learn to be spiritual. But all these are common religious concepts of many Christians. If we have the vision concerning God's plan for the church, we will see clearly that it is not enough to help others to be saved. It is not enough to help others pursue spirituality and love the Lord. God's plan in the universe is to have a church. This church is the living Body of the Son of God. In this Body He is expressed. For this matter, there is no distinction between something on earth today and something in heaven in the future.</P><P>There is a concept in Christianity today that is basically wrong. Man considers the church to be something on earth today, and in heaven in the future. I fully agree that in God's salvation there is such a thing as going to heaven. I do not deny that there is such a thing. Yet I do not like the expression "going to heaven." What God wants is a Body for His Son, and this Body is to be the expression of the Son. This concept of God has no element of time or space in it. He never considers whether it is to be on earth or in heaven, or whether it is to be for today or for the future. He has only one concept, which is to gain a group of people in His created universe&#151;including both time and space&#151;to be the mystical Body of His Son, in order that His Son would have an expression in this Body. He is not concerned with the question of whether it is in heaven or on earth, today or in the future. He has absolutely no concept of this sort. If the Son of God is to be expressed in this Body in the future, so much more does He want to be expressed today. If the Son of God is to be expressed in this Body in heaven, much more does He need to be expressed on earth. Every elder should have such knowledge. The church is the Body that God seeks after for His Son in His plan, for the purpose of expressing Him in the universe. This does not have to wait until the future to come into being. It is here today. We do not have to wait until we go to heaven to see it. It should be here on earth.</P><P>We thank the Lord that He raised up the British Brethren one hundred years ago. They saw much light concerning God's plan, the church, and the second coming of Christ. But we have to point out that the Brethren went too far in putting God's plan off until the future through the application of prophecies. If you look at the reference Bible of Dr. Scofield, whose teachings were mostly from the Brethren, you will realize that he has pushed the prophecies too far to the extreme, to the extent that he even made a distinction between the visible and the invisible church. According to his teaching, the visible church has some true elements and some false elements; only the invisible Church is all true. Some elements of the visible church are fleshly, while some are spiritual, but the invisible Church is all spiritual. The visible church is on earth, and the invisible Church is in heaven. It is unavoidable and tolerable for the visible church to be divided and denominated, for when the invisible Church comes, all divisions will disappear. Dear brothers and sisters, this is not the teaching of the Bible. You cannot find such teaching at all in the whole Bible. The Bible says that the church is the Body of Christ, and that it has no distinction between the present and the future, or between earthly and heavenly. If the church will be the Body of Christ in the future, so much more it is today.</P><P>We agree that there is a second coming of the Lord Jesus. We also agree that the Church will be raptured. But it is not only when the rapture of the church occurs that the nature and function of the church are realized. It is something for today. Every elder has to know God's plan for the church to such an extent. Otherwise, the management of the church will be affected. All the service has to be controlled by this vision. If you do not have a clear vision concerning God's plan, you will not be able to come up to the standard of God's plan in your management of the church. In order for the church to come up to the standard of God's plan, you must surely have such a vision. Only by being under the control of such a vision can there be the service according to the standard of such a vision.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God Desires Those Who Are Part of This Body<br>to Become Churches in the Different Localities</H2><P>In God's plan, He desires to have a Body for His Son in the universe. Yet in a practical way, God desires those who are part of this Body to become churches in the different localities. God desires that each one of these churches be a miniature and a representation, in the different localities, of the mystical Body of the Son of God. This kind of understanding is very much lacking among Christians today. Even some who are very much for the pursuit of spirituality neglect this fact.</P><P>In the first point, we talked about the universal church. In the second point, we are talking about the local church. An elder must have this twofold knowledge concerning God's plan for the church. He must know the universal Church, and he must also know the local church. In other words, he must know the Church in its universal aspect, and he must know the church in its local aspect. Never consider the universal Church to be one kind of church, and the local church to be another kind of church. There is only one Church. Collectively speaking, it is the universal church, and locally speaking, it is the local churches. Strictly speaking, the local churches are the universal Church. The universal Church is simply the sum total of the local churches, and the local churches are simply the local manifestations of the universal Church. Without the local churches, there cannot be the universal Church. When the elders are managing the local churches, they are managing the universal Church.</P><P>God's plan is to have a Church in the universe as the Body of His Son for His expression. However, to carry out this plan, He has to set up local churches in the different localities. If He does not set up churches in the different localities, God's universal plan for the church will be only an empty ideal with no way to be carried out. In order to carry out this plan, God has to set up churches in the different localities.</P><P>If you grasp hold of these two points, you will be clear when you read the New Testament again. There is a great vision in the New Testament that tells how the Church as the Body of Christ is the expression of the Son of God. This concerns God's plan in the universe. On the other hand, the New Testament shows us that the Church appears in the localities. It is in the different localities that God's plan is realized. Every elder should have a clear knowledge concerning all these matters. This is the elders' knowledge concerning the church. Of course, there are a number of matters connected with this subject, such as the question of denominations, the question of the ground, and the nature of the church. We will not go into these other things. Here we only emphasize the Church as the Body of Christ in God's plan for the expression of Christ and the church practiced on earth in the different localities.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. GOD'S GOVERNMENT</H2><P>Every elder should realize in a sober and profound way that the eldership is a matter of government in the church. We all know that another name for the elders is the overseers. The word "elder" refers to the person, and the word "overseer" refers to the office. As far as the person is concerned, these ones are the older and more mature ones. As far as their office is concerned, they work as overseers. The office of overseership is a part of God's government in the universe. For this reason, the elders must know about God's government.</P><P>In the New Testament, there are a few ministers of the word, each with his own characteristics. The center of Paul's ministry is the church. The center of John's ministry is the house of God. It deals with God as the Father, and the saved ones as the children of God. Although Peter's epistles are not as numerous as those of Paul or as the writings of John, he is nevertheless a great minister of the word. Peter's ministry deals exclusively with God's government, which is God's administration. Among the Lord's children today, many know that Paul's ministry is concerning the church, and many others know that John's ministry is about the house of God. But there are very few people who know that Peter's ministry is on God's government or administration.</P><P>Because the church has been degraded, whenever the word government or administration is mentioned, some begin to wonder immediately if this is Roman Catholicism. For this reason, among most Protestant Christians, and particularly among the more spiritual ones, there is a common concept that it is better to have no government and no administration than to have one. To them, as long as you understand that the church is the Body of Christ and the house of God, it is good enough. All that is needed is to help others love the Lord and be spiritual. As long as others are helped to have the life of God and to walk before the Lord, everything is all right. To them, there is no need to have anything like government. But, brothers and sisters, we are not more wise than God. In the universe, there is such a thing as the government of God and the administration of God. This is something ordained by God, and we cannot neglect it.</P><P>In the Bible, the kingdom is a matter of government. The kingdom of God is the government of God. It is also the administration of God. Today the universe is in disorder because God's government has not been honored. The elders should not only see that in the universe there is God's salvation, God's church, and God's house; they must further see that in the universe there is God's government and God's administration. God is not a God of confusion. He is not a God without principle and rule. God is a God with principles, rules, order, and discipline. For this reason, God must establish His administration and government in the universe.</P><P>Every book of the Bible shows us God's government and administration. Consider the story of the Israelites leaving Egypt to pass through the desert to enter Canaan. Whether in the book of Exodus or in Numbers, we can see a very tightly knit coordination and building. This coordination and building is fully under God's government and administration. Among the Israelites, there was a situation full of God's government and administration. God did not let one thing get by loosely. Not one thing was handled in a sloppy way. We do not see one instance where God told the Israelites, "Do as you please!" Instead, everything great or small was under God's government and administration. Even minute details concerning the manner in which to wash themselves, the way to wash their clothes, and the way to shave their beards were not left to the choice of the Israelites. This was the Old Testament. Does this mean then that in the church God has no more government and administration? This cannot be true. In the New Testament, every aspect of God's dealing with the church is under His government and administration. When the New Testament mentions the church, on the one hand, there are words full of life and the Spirit. On the other hand, there are also words full of government and administration.</P><P>In order to manage a church properly, an elder has to know that God desires to execute His government in the universe through the church. The church is definitely not a place without government and administration. The church in the New Testament is a place where there is very much government and administration. You can read about the government of the church in the book of Romans. You can also read about the government of the church in the Epistles to the Corinthians. You can even read about the government of the church in Ephesians, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus. There is hardly a book among the New Testament epistles that does not touch the government of the church.</P><P>Even before the epistles, in the Gospels the matter of government has been touched already. The Lord Jesus only speaks about the church briefly in two instances. The first time is in Matthew chapter sixteen. There He said that upon the rock He would build the church, against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail. The other time is in Matthew chapter eighteen. There it says that if a brother sins and refuses to repent, in spite of repeated exhortation, the matter should be brought to the church. If he would not listen to the church, he should be considered as a Gentile. Let me ask you, brothers and sisters: Is what the Lord mentioned here in Matthew 18 not a matter of government? Up until today, among God's children it is still difficult to get rid of a feeling that a certain brother is weak, and therefore we have to be merciful to him, or that a brother has sinned, and therefore the Lord has to grant him mercy. But in Matthew chapter eighteen, there was the Lord's mercy, and there was also the spiritual guidance. In the end, the problem was solved by the way of government. When a brother sins and you render him the help while the two of you are together, it is a spiritual matter. But when he refuses to repent, and two or three would go to him to help him, it is partly a spiritual matter and partly a governmental matter. If he would not repent and the matter is told to the church, it becomes more a governmental matter than a spiritual one. When the church steps forth to deal with the matter, and there is still no sign of repentance, and the person involved is considered a Gentile, it becomes fully a governmental matter. The whole thing becomes a matter of administration.</P><P>I am afraid many elders today do not have the concept of government. They only consider that they are serving together with the brothers and sisters and are having spiritual fellowship one with another. On the one hand, this kind of humility is correct. On the other hand, it is very wrong. Every elder has to see that God has His government in the universe, and He also has His government in the church. Every one who lacks a vision concerning God's government will be unable to serve satisfactorily as an elder before God. God has His government in the universe; hence, He must also have His government in the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. GOD'S AUTHORITY</H2><P>In order for the elders to know God's government, they must first know God's authority. Without authority, there is no government. Government is absolutely a matter of authority. How can there be government and administration without authority? The matter of administration is a matter of authority. In the whole universe, God's administration hinges on His authority. Whenever we mention the administration of a church by the elders, we should immediately have the concept of authority. Today, however, due to the degraded background of Roman Catholicism on the one hand, and the so-called democracy of the age on the other hand, God's children do not like to hear about the matter of authority. Once the matter of authority is brought up, immediately people question whether we are in Roman Catholicism or whether we are having a pope again. It seems that among the Lord's children, once authority is mentioned, they cannot have a democracy anymore. Some would even say that authority is now being assumed, as if authority is a matter to be condemned. Brothers and sisters, the Pope should be condemned, and autocracy should be condemned, but authority can never be annulled. We have to see that in the universe, there is God's administration, and there is God's authority.</P><P>No matter how much man talks about democracy in these days, everywhere in the universe you are met with authority. Sometimes, man has stretched the meaning of democracy to such an extent as to make it an excuse for lawlessness. Yet he still cannot overturn authority. In the whole world and among human society, in everything you see the matter of authority. In the family there is authority, and in the school there is authority. In a business institution there is authority, and in the civil government there is authority. There is not a place where there is no authority. As a child, you have your parents as your authority. As a citizen, you have the government as your authority. As a student, there are the teachers and the principal above you. Even when you walk on the street, the traffic policeman is an authority to you. In the whole universe, everywhere you will touch authority. But God's children are so bold today as to say that the church does not need authority and that everyone is equal. What a strange thing this is! Therefore we have to see that either we do not mention church administration at all, or we have to mention it by firstly touching the matter of authority. Without authority, there is no administration. In order for the elders to manage the church, on the one hand, they have to know God's government in the universe; on the other hand, they have to know God's authority in the universe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>We have seen that God has His government in the universe. We have to see that there is government also in the church. The New Testament revelation shows us that the government of the church is very simple and practical: All the government of a church is entrusted to the elders. The elders are the government of the church. According to their spiritual stature, the elders are those who are mature and older. According to the affairs they handle, they are the overseers, which speaks of government and administration. Many times, we consider the elders to be the leading ones, the shepherds, and those who take care of others. Seldom do we consider them to be the ones responsible for government. Please remember that shepherding, exercising care, and leading are all for government. The Bible has not called the elders teachers or shepherds. Although 1 Peter says that the elders should shepherd the flock, it does not call them shepherds. However, the Bible clearly calls the elders overseers (Phil. 1:1). Teacher is not a title ascribed to the elders, nor is shepherd a title ascribed to the elders. Only overseer is a title ascribed to the elders. The reason for this is that the elders are those responsible for government and administration. God set up elders in the church in order that they would manage and govern the church.</P><P>I would like the brothers and sisters to know that if the elders are truly managing and governing the church, the church will surely be strong. If the elders only shepherd and teach without managing, or if they are incapable of managing, the church will be weak. Even if it is strong and living for a while, the situation is not reliable and will not last long. In order for a local church to be strong, living, reliable, and stable, the elders must be able to govern and administer.</P><P>Perhaps the brothers would ask where in the Bible can we find the elders managing the church. In the New Testament, not only do we have examples, but we have the definite teaching as well. First Corinthians talks about the matter of excommunication. This is a matter of administration. First Timothy chapter three says clearly that the elders are those who take care of, or manage the church. First Corinthians chapter twelve says that God appoints in the church apostles, prophets, and other kinds of people, including one kind that is for administration. Romans chapter twelve says that those who lead should do so in diligence. The management and administration here speak of government.</P><P>In a locality where saints begin to meet, under normal circumstances, elders should be set up as soon as possible. This is the example of Acts chapter fourteen. Not long after Paul had preached in Asia, he appointed elders in those churches. Without the elders, there will be no government in the church, and there will be no administration. The church will then be in confusion and will not be strong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>God's government in the universe depends on God's authority. In the same way, the church's government also depends on the church's authority. The New Testament shows us clearly that the authority of the church is entrusted to the elders and is completely in the hands of the elders. Although the elders are appointed by the apostles, God has not entrusted the authority of the church to the hands of the apostles. The Apostle Paul could set up elders in the church, but when the matter of excommunication was to be carried out, Paul did not have the direct authority to excommunicate others. The authority of excommunication was in the hands of the elders in Corinth. The apostles do not have direct authority to deal with matters of the church. All the authority in the church is entrusted to the elders.</P><P>Acts chapter fifteen shows us that when one local church has a problem, and the problem is such that it affects the other churches, the question should be solved by the apostles and the elders together. In that particular instance in Jerusalem, the apostles did not make independent decisions apart from the elders. The apostles decided on the matter in conjunction with the elders. The reason for this is that the matter originated from the church in Jerusalem. Apart from the elders in Jerusalem, the apostles had no way to deal with the difficulty of the church there. Here we can see the importance of the elders' authority. The apostles do not have direct authority to deal with affairs of a local church. The authority of a local church is fully in the hands of the elders.</P><P>I hope that the workers serving the different churches would be careful. Unless you are an elder in a local church, you have no authority to directly touch the affairs of the local church. Although some local churches have elders, the authority is in the hands of the workers; this is a big mistake. No matter how much help a worker renders to a local church, even if the church there has been established by him, if he is not an elder there, the authority of the church is not in his hands.</P><P>You could imagine that if there were no government in the universe and God's authority were to be denied, the universe would surely be in chaos. In the same principle, if there is no authority or government in the church, it will also be improper, in chaos, weak, and off the track. If the spiritual condition of a church is normal, there will surely be government and authority. The government and authority there are the elders appointed by God in their midst.</P><P>I hope that the brothers and sisters would be delivered from the improper concept that considers this matter to be the Nicolaitans among us, or that this is the Diotrephes who loves to be the first, or that this is a contradiction of the teaching of Matthew chapter twenty. There the Lord says clearly that we should not be as the Gentiles, with rulers to lord over others. Rather we are all brothers. Every time someone says this to me, I would answer him by saying that if he can rule over himself, then let him rule over himself. There is no need for others to rule over him. I encourage him to take this way of independence from the rule of others. I believe all of you know what I mean. One time I was in Manila, and an elderly sister came to me, saying, "Brother Lee, isn't this talk about authority a way of manipulating everybody to submit to someone?" I smiled and answered, "In that case it would be better if you are the first one to refuse any obedience. Why should you be manipulated?" We have to see that there is a problem with our human concept. It is useless to argue in theory. What we need to see is the actual condition. Among God's children, as soon as authority disappears, immediately the church will become very weak. There is a very clear light in the New Testament, which is that in the church there are the elders as the authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. DELEGATED AUTHORITY</H2><P>Lastly, we have to see that in the universe, only God is the direct authority to man. Other than God, all authorities are delegated. The parents represent God as the children's authority, and the husbands represent God as the wives' authority. The civil officers represent God as the citizens' authority, and even the teachers in the schools, the managers in the offices, and the policemen on the streets are all delegated authorities. The elders in the church also represent God as authority. Today while living on earth, seldom do we live under God's direct authority. Almost all the authorities that we submit to are delegated authorities. Please understand that to say that the church should have no authority amounts to saying that there should not be delegated authorities in the universe. But if this were the case, it would amount to the universe having no authority at all. The reason for this is that there are not many cases where God acts directly as authority. In almost all circumstances, God's authority is delegated.</P><P>I would like the brothers and sisters to know that it is easy today for man to submit to God's direct authority, but it is not easy to submit to the delegated authority God has appointed. The reason for this is that you may not consider the delegated authority better or stronger than you are. Right here, however, is the lesson you have to learn. The question is whether or not a certain one is a delegated authority in the universe. When you come to a local church, the elders there may not have been saved as long ago as you were. They may not be as spiritual as you are, and may not have received as much education as you have received, or be as capable as you are. But when you are there, you have to accept that delegated authority and submit to it.</P><P>I say these words not to all the brothers and sisters, but to the elders. The elders should know these things; only then will they be proper elders. This does not mean that you should be proud. It does not mean that you should boast that you are the authority of the church, or that you are a delegated authority! If you do, that would be one of the ugliest things on earth. Every elder should know why there is the need of elders in the church. Why does God set up elders in the church? It is for no other reason than that the church would be strong on earth and would be delivered from the element of confusion and corruption. If you do not believe me, you only need to imagine what kind of confusion and corruption would come into a place if there were a city without any policemen or any law court! Hence, we should never despise that little bit of delegated authority. Of course, we all admit that human society is corrupt. Although human society is corrupt, nevertheless you cannot deny that a normal situation is established to a certain degree. This degree of normality is established by the delegated authority. If you were to overturn the police department, the whole city would immediately be thrown into turmoil, and much corruption would break out. In the same principle, we, the redeemed and regenerated ones, are children together in the house of God, serving the Lord in the church. If we were to remove from the church the delegated authority, the church would be thrown into a similar kind of confusion.</P><P>Hence, an elder has to know God's plan for the church, and he also has to know God's government and administration in the universe. Furthermore, he has to know God's government and administration in the church. In the end, he has to know that this authority in the church, like nearly all the other authorities in the universe, is a delegated authority, and not a direct one. It is a great and glorious thing for an elder to be such a delegated authority in the plan of God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PERSON OF AN ELDER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELDERS</H2><P>If we read the whole Bible carefully, we can see that God's plan and His purpose are fulfilled in the church. Without the church, God's plan cannot be fulfilled, and God's desire cannot be realized. Hence, we can say that God's plan and His desire hinge upon the church. The Bible also shows us that the focus of the church is the elders. If a local church has no elders, strictly speaking, it is as if there were no church. This can be compared to a country in the world that cannot be considered a nation because there are citizens, but there is no government. In the same principle, it does not matter how many brothers and sisters there are in a locality; if no elders are raised up, they cannot be considered a church. As a nation must have a legitimate government in addition to having citizens, so a church must have elders appointed in addition to having a group of saved saints.</P><P>I hope that the brothers and sisters would have a strong feeling concerning this matter. Not only does the Bible say this, but history also testifies to this, and our experience can also attest to it. Wherever there are strong elders, there are strong churches. Wherever there are spiritual elders, there are spiritual churches. Whether a church is strong or weak, spiritual or fleshly, absolutely depends on the elders. Wherever you go, the condition of the elders in that place determines the condition of the church. This is something very real.</P><P>Hence, we have to see that the most important group of people in the whole universe is the elders. If there were no church, the universe would be a void; it would be useless to God. The elders are the center of the church. Without the elders, the church would likewise be a void. Hence, the elders are the most important group of people in the universe.</P><P>Perhaps some brothers would ask, "Does not the Bible say that the apostles are higher and more important than the elders?" No doubt, the apostles are the ones to raise up the churches. Even the elders in the church are appointed by the apostles. Please remember, however, that the key to the condition in the church does not hinge on the apostles; rather it hinges on the elders. I have the assurance to say that if a local church has strong elders, even if the apostles are a little weak, the church will nevertheless be strong. But if the elders are weak, even if the apostles are strong, the church will still be weak. Whether a church is strong or weak depends directly on the elders.</P><P>From the seven epistles in Revelation, you can clearly see the importance of the position of the elders. The beginning of Revelation shows us that in the whole universe God's testimony is the churches in the different localities as His lampstands. The seven lampstands are the seven local churches, shining for God in the universe as His testimony. None of the seven epistles to the churches were written to the apostles. Every one of them was for the messengers of the seven churches. Under normal circumstances, the messengers of the church are the elders of the church. It is true that the different churches are God's lampstands in the different places. Yet when the Lord came to speak, He did not speak directly to the churches; rather He spoke to the messengers of the churches.</P><P>If we see this, we will worship the Lord. We will prostrate ourselves in the dust and admit that in God's view and according to His plan, there is no other group of people whose importance exceeds that of the elders. In the whole universe, the most important group of people is the elders. Why is this the case? It is because all the accomplishment of God's plan in the universe and the attainment of His desire hinge upon the elders in the church.</P><P>We say this not for the elders to be proud; rather it shows all of us the important position in which the grace of God has placed the elders. Those who are not in the position of elders should also consider highly the elders in the church. Today I say before the Lord that I always have a heart that respects the elders in all the churches. Every time I hear that a certain matter was decided by the elders, I have nothing more to say. I fully respect the decision of the elders. It does not matter how small a place is. As long as it is a decision by the elders there, we all have to learn to respect it. We have to know that this is to respect the greatest appointment of God in the universe. If we have the light, we will see that in the whole universe God has an appointment that is altogether divine and profound, which is the appointment of the elders in the church. This is a tremendous matter. From my experience I can tell the brothers and sisters that the blessing of God is right here. Even if the elders are not very good and their decisions are not very accurate, as long as we respect those decisions, the result will always be a blessing. It will be not only a blessing to us as individuals, but a blessing to the church, and the elders themselves will be perfected.</P><P>If the elders were not so important, it would not have been necessary for apostles such as Peter and James to be elders during their long stay in Jerusalem. It is because the elders are very important that the first group of "first class" apostles such as Peter, James, and John had to be elders in Jerusalem while they stayed there for a long time.</P><P>Never consider that the elders are lower or less important than the apostles. On the contrary, we should see that the key to the condition of the church is not with the apostles, but with the elders. If an apostle stays in a place for a long time, even he himself has to become one of the elders. The fulfillment of God's plan and desire for the church depends completely on the elders. The authority of the church is not in the hands of the apostles; the authority of the church is in the hands of the elders. Only the elders are the central figures of the church. In short, God's will in the whole universe hinges upon the church, and the center of the church is the elders. From this we can see the importance of the elders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE PERSON OF AN ELDER</H2><P>We all know that to do anything, first there is the need of a person to do it. Next comes the method. The Chinese say that the kind of thing accomplished depends on the kind of person carrying it out. The method may be the same. But for you to do it, it will succeed. For me to do it, it may fail. For you, there may be a good result. For me, the result may not be very good. Hence, the problem is not the method but the person. Concerning the administration of the church by the elders, our emphasis is also not the method of administration. Rather it is the administrator that is important. It does not mean that with the right method the church will be managed well. Only when the person is right will the church be managed well. Hence, the foremost question is the person; the methods are secondary. Without the administrating person, the method amounts to zero. Only when there is the administrating person, plus the methods, will the result be beneficial. The person is the basis.</P><P>This shows us that whoever tries to consider the management of the church from the standpoint of methods is wrong. The matter must begin from the person of the elders. It is useless to change the method; the only way is to change the person. Perhaps some brothers have the thought that it is quite difficult to find some reference material concerning the elders' management of the church, that there is no such book nor such testimonies, and that it is difficult to find out even from the Bible what this is all about. Many are really bewildered as to how the elders should manage the church. They may think that now that Brother Lee is going to talk about the way for the elders to manage a church, everything will be wonderful. Now everyone will know how to manage a church. Brothers, there is no such thing. Perhaps after this chapter on the elders' management of the church, you will become more confused and more unclear. The more I speak, the more confused you will become. The more I speak, the more you will not know how to manage a church. The reason for this is that the management of a church firstly depends on the person. The method is secondary.</P><P>I would seriously warn the brothers that to manage affairs in the church, it is dangerous to use any method when the person is not right. What are methods? To put it in terms that are not so nice, methods are crafts. To be crafty is to be political. To administrate a church, you cannot be political. The work of all those who manage the church in a political way will result in vanity. The worldly politicians can play politics, but the elders in the church cannot play politics. The church is not a society; the church is a family. In a family, the head of the household cannot be crafty or play politics. The head of the household manages the family by his person. It is the person that manages the family, not a method that does it. In the same way, the church is the house of God. There is no need for a good method of administration; rather, there is the need of a good person for administration.</P><P>Take the problem of the heart as an example. The biggest need for one who manages the church is to have a broad heart. Concerning this point, perhaps I will speak more in the next chapter. Of course, there are many other aspects to an elder's heart, but the most indispensable thing is a broad heart. If an elder has a narrow heart, trouble will immediately appear. I have personally seen this kind of thing happening in the church. When trouble breaks out in the church, the cause is the narrowness of the elders' hearts. Strictly speaking, all those who have a narrow heart cannot be elders. Perhaps you would ask, what do I do if my heart is narrow by birth? You should then go home and pray. The Lord will change your heart. The elders' hearts have to be so big that they can contain not only a fist, but the whole earth as well. An elder must have a broad heart.</P><P>Please remember, however, that a broad heart is not a matter of a method, but a matter of the person. If an elder realizes his own problem, and he humbles himself and confesses that his heart is indeed narrow, and that from now on he would try to be broad, brothers and sisters, this is but a method. If your heart is narrow, it will not work for you to try to be broad.</P><P>I do not know if you are able to tell the difference. Some elders have a broad heart because the person is broad. Other elders seem to have a broad heart only because they are broad in method. Actually their hearts are narrow, but in order to meet a certain practical need, they take a method that is broad. I would like to point out to the brothers and sisters that eventually this broadness becomes their maneuvering.</P><P>I mention this example to show you that the first problem an elder has to deal with is his person. You cannot be satisfied just by changing the method. Of course, we do not mean that the methods need not be changed. What we mean is that it is not enough merely to change the method; rather the person has to change. If you are a narrow-minded person, but you try to be an elder with broad ways, surely the result will be a failure. You cannot deal only with the method without taking care of the person.</P><P>We can take another example. Some elders love the Lord very much and are very given to the service, but in their daily life they are very loose and sloppy in their reading of the Word and prayer. One day, they find themselves having to lead the brothers and sisters to read the Bible and to pray, and for the sake of being a pattern to others and an example to the flock, they begin to read the Bible and to pray properly. I can tell you that such reading and praying are numbered in their days. I can guarantee you that they will not last for more than two or three months. I believe you understand what I mean. Here is a method; it is not the person. If you want to help others to read the Bible and pray, you yourself must first be a reading person and a praying person. You have to be such a person with or without being an elder. The reading and the praying should not be your method; they should be your person. If you read the Bible and pray only because you are an elder, such reading and praying is the method of being an elder. It will not work. You have to be the right kind of person to be an elder.</P><P>Take another example. An elder has to be honest. You may ask how it is that a brother who is dishonest, pretentious, and crafty can be an elder. I have to let you know, however, that man is not simple; man is very complicated. I have definitely seen elders in the church who love the Lord and are earnest in pursuit, who also are dishonest. Suppose a brother has definitely made mistakes before the Lord, and the Lord has given me as an elder an opportunity to see him, and the brother is very humble to ask me what he should do. If I am a very tactful person, I would say, "Brother, you are just fine. You are all right." But this is being dishonest. It is not the honest way of dealing with one another. Although a Christian has to learn to be human, he should not learn to be human according to the way of worldly society. That kind of being human is eighty to ninety percent pretentious. When such a brother comes to me, even if I cannot say a strong or straight word to him, I should at least not commend him as being all right and being fine. I must consider his condition and ability to receive. If he cannot receive my frank rebuke, then it is better that I keep quiet and be a dumb person before him. I cannot tell him that he is fine and that he is very good. This is to be a pretentious person.</P><P>I have encountered this kind of thing often. Sometimes, after a talk with such a brother as this, the elder that commended him would turn to me right away and say, "Brother Lee, this brother is too much off." When I heard this, immediately my countenance changed, and I said, "Brother, you are not an elder. You are a Judas! The last twenty minutes when you were talking to him, you said that he was very good. But he has just left, and now you are telling me that he is terrible. You do not behave like a Christian. You are deceiving your brother." Sometimes the elder would even explain to me, saying, "Oh, you do not realize how bad a temper this brother has. If you say that he is not good, he will right away lose his temper. Sometimes it becomes worse, and he would even hit you." I said, "Brother, even if you were afraid that he would hit you, you should not have commended him. This is lying. If you think that he cannot take it, you can remain silent when he talks with you. Sometimes silence is more powerful than frank words. You do not need to stir him up, but neither should you praise him."</P><P>Brothers and sisters, unless you do nothing, whatever you do, no matter how much you keep it secret, sooner or later others will know about it. You may tell a brother that he is quite good, and may turn around soon after he leaves and say that he is terrible. You may think you are saying it only behind his back and not to his face, but you can be sure that in less than half a year, he will find out. He will then say that on a certain date you as an elder commended him to his face, but as soon as he left, you criticized him as being terrible, and therefore, you are one kind of person to his face, and another kind of person behind his back. In this way, you have given yourself away by being the person that you are.</P><P>Hence, an elder has to learn to be a faithful and honest person. We can never say a word before the brothers that we do not mean. When it is difficult for us to say something, we can remain silent, but we must never say something that we do not mean.</P><P>I have been questioned by brothers in a nice way before as to why I kept silent when they came to me some time earlier, asking me to comment on their condition. I said, "Brother, you know what your condition was at that time. If I had said something to you then, what would the consequences have been?" After they pondered for a while, they said, "You are right, brother. You knew I could not take it then. You did not say anything because you weighed my condition at that time."</P><P>Let me say something more concerning pretense. The elders should love the brothers and sisters and should care for them. This love and care should also be something in their person, not a mere method. I may be one who genuinely loves the brothers and sisters as a result of the Lord's love in me. The Lord has put in me a love for the brothers and sisters, and I cannot help but love them. When I see a brother who is sick, spontaneously I am concerned for him. When I see a brother who has lost his job, spontaneously I care for him; or, when another one has some lack, I feel the same lack also. This proves that my love and care has to do with my person. This is right.</P><P>When a certain elder meets a brother in need, he would say, "Oh, brother, you are in such desperate need. May the Lord be gracious to you." But after he turns around, he forgets all about the matter. This is pretense. If you do not have the heart toward that person, you should not say those words. When he loses his job or is in sorrow, you do not have to express such a pretentious gesture if you are really not concerned about him. To do so is falsehood. It may seem to be perfectly all right for you to be a false person if, after you act in pretense once, you move to the moon. Otherwise, others will eventually become tired of listening to your sympathetic "Oh's," and they will say that this elder is pretending.</P><P>I admit that this lesson is difficult to learn. We are all sons of Adam, and it is difficult for our hearts to be broad. We all have a wicked nature. For us to be human is easy, but for us to deal with others honestly is very difficult. Nevertheless, brothers, since we have received the Lord's mercy to be appointed as elders among His people, we should be honest persons. We are not here to learn some methods of being elders. Rather we are here to be enlightened, to submit to the Lord's hand, and to receive His dealings. It is not a question of picking up some method, but a matter of receiving His dealings. To be an elder is a matter of the person. As soon as we become involved with methods, we fall into pretense.</P><P>Brothers, even your politeness and courtesy have to be genuine. For some elders, even their politeness to the brothers and sisters is false. In the world, there may be the need for polite pretense, but in the church, the elders should not have any polite pretense. Furthermore, even your anger has to be genuine. It is true that an elder should restrict his temper, but there should not be any false restriction. False restrictions are but attempts to be human and political. Perhaps you may ask me what is false restriction of temper, and what is its genuine restriction. I can perhaps describe to you a little. For example, I may be a very quick-tempered person, but I have received mercy from the Lord to be an elder in the church. When problems arise among the brothers and sisters, it is true that I can easily lose my temper, but I know that elders are not supposed to lose their temper. If they do, they will ruin things. For that reason I submit myself to the hand of the Lord and receive the Lord's discipline to deal with my temper. Not only do I deal with it before the brothers and sisters, but I deal with it at home before the Lord. I would smite my chest and say to the Lord, "Lord, You know how bad my temper is. I hate myself. Unless You are merciful to me, the church will be ruined under my hands." You have to realize that this kind of restriction of the temper is genuine.</P><P>Some elders, however, are not like this. When brothers are involved in troubles and bring complaints to them, they realize that they cannot lose their temper, and that if they do, everything will be lost. As a result, they suffer patiently before the brothers and put on a smiling face. But when they get home, immediately they grumble and complain, saying, "I am not here as an elder for their money. What right do they have to bother me this way!" This restriction of the temper is false. Do not think that I am imagining all these things. They are all actual cases. Sometimes, after an elder complained this way at home, the troubled brother came right afterward to visit his home. The elder would then invite him politely into the living room and would give him a smiling face again, as if all his temper had disappeared. Forty-five minutes later, after the brother has left, the wife may come and ask about the conversation, and he would fill his mouth with complaints again, saying, "I do not live by their wallets. Why should they bother me like that? It is bad enough for them to bother me in the elders' room. They are now even giving me trouble at my home!" Brothers and sisters, this kind of restriction of temper is false. We can never do this. If you are such an elder, the church will surely be corrupted from the inside out. The elders in the church must be genuine and honest. If I am to deal with my temper, I have to deal with it from the inside out. I must deal with it before God and before the brothers. The restriction of temper should not be a matter of a method for me. Rather, it should be a lesson for me as a person.</P><P>Brothers, there is a very great difference here. Many times, the humility of the elders is a performance before man; the elders are actually very proud before God. The person is proud, but the method is humble. It is a proud person assuming a humble method. This is possible in human society and organizations, but it cannot be done in the church.</P><P>Take another example. The matter of diligence is the same. The elders should be diligent, but it must be the person who is diligent. You must be a diligent person, instead of adopting a diligent method.</P><P>The same is true for the daily living. Some elders have one manner of living in private and another manner of living in the church before the brothers and sisters. This is pretense. One should have the same kind of living before the brothers and sisters, and in private as well. We have to be genuine persons. What is needed of an elder is the person, and not a method. It is not a method that manages the church; rather it is the person who manages the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE LESSON OF THE ELDERS</H2><P>The lesson the elders have to learn is absolutely not methods, ways, skills, or tactfulness. The lesson for the elders is brokenness before God. A clever person is not necessarily capable of managing a church. Neither is a capable person necessarily competent to manage a church. A person who reasons well may not be competent at managing a church, and neither is a person who has resources for everything necessarily competent at managing a church. Only one kind of person can manage a church&#151;a broken person. All the lessons that an elder has to learn are lessons of brokenness. When God put Moses over His flock, Israel, He first put Moses in the wilderness for forty years, with the purpose that he might learn the lesson of brokenness. In Numbers 12, even when Moses' sister Miriam and his brother Aaron rose up to slander him, God's word testifies for him, saying, "The man Moses was very meek, more than all men who were on the face of the earth." During those forty years in the wilderness, Moses did not learn a set of methods concerning how to manage God's people. He learned only one lesson, the lesson of brokenness. God had broken him. When he was forty years of age, he was indeed a very shrewd and capable person. It was as if God said, "Shrewdness will not work; capabilities will not work; the fist that killed the Egyptian will not work; the brute method that slew the Egyptian will not work." All these must be torn down. All these must be broken. God put him in the wilderness for forty years to teach him one lesson only&#151;the lesson of brokenness.</P><P>In any local church, or in any district meeting, only a broken person can manage and build. Over a long period, time will be the test. Your wisdom, your capability, your shrewdness, your cleverness will not stand the test of time. If you manage the church with your skill, tactfulness, cleverness, and methods, you may get by this year, but you will not be able to get by another year. Even if you can get by the next year, you will not get by the following year. At most you can get by up to the fourth year, but by the fifth year, you will not be able to get through. Time will be a trial, and time will also be the test. However, if a broken person is to lead and manage the church, he will withstand the test of time. As time goes on, the church he manages will have more and more the measure of reality.</P><P>Therefore, please remember that the lesson for the elders is brokenness. Reasoning is absolutely of no use, and negotiation is absolutely of no use. In the church the one who is most capable of reasoning is the one who is most incapable of managing. The one who is most capable of negotiating is the one who is most incapable of building up the church. There is only one kind of person who can manage the church, and that is a person who is broken. It does not mean that such a person cannot reason, but he has been broken and is no longer trusting in reasoning. It does not mean that such a person does not have ways to manage things, but he has been broken and is no longer using these methods. He is capable, but after he has been broken, he no longer makes use of his skill. He has wisdom, but once he is broken, he will not use his wisdom. Only such a broken person can manage the church.</P><P>These days we have been studying Numbers. We see that Moses was nearly one hundred twenty years old. He passed through forty years of life in the Egyptian palace, forty years of testing in tending the flock in the wilderness, and thirty-eight years of experience in leading the Israelites. Each time the Israelites rose up to trouble him, however, he did not exercise his own tactfulness. This is an amazing thing. He never negotiated, and he never reasoned with the people. It may seem that Moses was reasoning in Numbers 16:28-30, but actually he was not reasoning. He never exercised his own ways. Each time difficulty arose, he did not reason; he had no methods, arguments, or tactfulness. He only submitted himself to God and let God solve the problem. He was truly a broken man.</P><P>The Scriptures tell us that Moses had exhaustively studied the knowledge of the Egyptians. Historians also tell us that he was not only a statesman and an educator, but also a military strategist. He was such a capable man, yet look how much he was harassed by the Israelites! He was like a man without knowledge, without capabilities, and without resources. He only knew to prostrate himself before God. The more the Israelites created disturbances, the more he fell down before God. If there were any methods, he let God work them out. If there were any words to be said, he let God speak to the people. Here we see a man who had wisdom, knowledge, and capabilities, yet he was a broken man. Brothers, only when the church is in the hand of such a person can it be a vessel that truly expresses Christ. Only when the church is in the hand of such a person can it have a genuine building up. The more the elders are broken, the more the church will be built up.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE HEART OF AN ELDER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HEART TO THE ELDERS</H2><P>We have mentioned before that in doing anything, the person who is doing the work must be the right person. If we do not have the proper person, or if the person is not the right person, we cannot expect things to be done well. All the important matters in the world can testify to this principle. For example, the constitution of a country may be good and its system of government excellent, but if the executives are not qualified, the country cannot be administered properly. When the executives are replaced, even if the constitution and the system of government remain the same, the outcome will be completely different. The same is true with spiritual things. For this reason, we have to see that the administration in the church depends firstly on the person. We are not saying that methods are not important, but methods depend upon the person. If the person is off, methods are of no use, no matter how good they may be. The person must be right before the methods will work.</P><P>In addition to the problem of the person, there is also the problem of the heart, which also needs much dealing. Whereas in the world it is possible to consider only the person, in the church there must be a certain standard with regard to the heart as well. The reason for this is that in the church everything is transparent and in the light. There cannot be any inconsistency between the outward condition and the inward condition. Strictly speaking, even in the world, for a person to be right, he must have a very proper heart. This shows the absolute relatedness between the heart and the person. If a person's heart is off by just a little, that person is not an honest and genuine man.</P><P>In order for a man to be right, his heart must be right. If the heart is off, the man will be off also. Especially with those who are elders, the heart must be dealt with until it is very proper. As long as the heart of an elder is slightly off, we can never expect the person of that elder to be right. I believe all those brothers who have had considerable experience in their responsibilities as elders will tell us that as an elder, everyone has to go through severe lessons of brokenness. However, brokenness only deals with the person of the elder. In taking up the responsibility as an elder, a person's heart constitutes a serious factor. If a brother who is an elder loves the Lord very much and fears Him, and if he has learned many spiritual lessons and is willing to be broken in almost everything, yet he neglects the dealing with his heart, it is still easy for such a one to cause problems.</P><P>I wish to speak with the brothers and sisters in this way: while it is true that a man's spirituality can affect the condition of his heart before God, spirituality itself cannot make up for the condition of man's heart. It is one thing to be spiritual and another thing to have a right condition of the heart. Of course, we admit that these two things affect each other. But this does not mean that as long as a person is spiritual, he will definitely have no problem with his heart. There is no such thing. We must strongly emphasize that there is a considerable difference here.</P><P>I do not want to mention much about being spiritual in these messages that deal mainly with the administration of the eldership in the church. We have spoken much about this subject in the past messages. Today, I want to seriously bring up the question of the heart. For an elder, the problem of the heart is a very serious matter; it is an important factor in his function as an elder. No matter how spiritual a person is, if his heart is not right, he will not be able to be a good elder. We can fully testify to this from our experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BEING LARGE IN HEART</H2><P>As an elder, a person must first have a heart that is large. Largeness is the first necessary condition of an elder's heart. In the Bible, there is one very good ruler, King Solomon. All readers of the Bible admit that he is a standard and a typical character concerning administration in the Bible. If we want to find a standard character on experiencing the cross, we have to go to David. But to find a standard character on managing God's people, we have to go to Solomon. Solomon was indeed competent at managing. We must remember, however, that King Solomon was competent at managing for two reasons: he had wisdom, and he had a large heart. Actually, these are two aspects of one thing.</P><P>You will recall that Solomon succeeded to the throne when he was very young. As soon as he succeeded to the throne, he went to offer sacrifices to God. In the night, while God appeared to him, Solomon prayed, "And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in....Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad" (1 Kings 3:7-9). He wanted wisdom from God. Everyone knows that the most necessary thing in management is wisdom. To have cleverness is not enough, because cleverness is common, whereas wisdom is extraordinary. Solomon deeply felt that for a young man to rule the myriads of God's people, he needed wisdom from God. That was why he sought for wisdom before God. Surprisingly, however, though he asked only for wisdom, God gave him, in addition to wisdom, also a large heart. First Kings 4:29 says, "And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore." It says that largeness of heart is like the sand on the seashore. A Chinese proverb speaks of the heart being as large as the capacity of the sea, but here the heart is as large as the sand on the seashore. The seashore encloses the sea. The Scriptures say that God has "placed the sand for the bound of the sea" (Jer. 5:22). Therefore, Solomon's heart was larger than the sea.</P><P>At the time when God gave Solomon wisdom, He also gave him a large heart. We have to know that all wise ones have large hearts, and everyone with a narrow heart is a foolish person. If you want to be a foolish person, let me teach you a way: simply make your heart small. In the same principle, if you enlarge your heart, you will become the wisest person. You cannot separate a large heart from wisdom and prudence. This is why I say that these are two aspects of one thing.</P><P>Pride is an expression of foolishness. But from where does pride come? It comes from being narrow. When a person is narrow and his heart is narrow, it is easy for him to be proud. It is very hard for a person with a large heart to be proud. For example, we have a young guest living in our house now. He always boasts to me. He is a typical proud person. When he puts on a pair of little shoes, he is elated and walks around in a haughty way. However, brothers and sisters, a large person would not feel anything concerning a pair of shoes; even if he is given two automobiles, he will not feel anything. This is because such a person is large. Pride is the expression of the narrowness of a person. Suppose you give a message unusually well one day, and, as a result, you become proud. This pride proves your narrowness. If your heart is large, even if you have preached very well a thousand times, let alone only once, you would not feel anything. All foolishness proves that a person's heart is narrow, and all pride proves that you are too small.</P><P>If a person is narrow, his heart is narrow. What does it mean to be a large person? It means to be a person whose heart is large. He may accomplish much without feeling anything. He may enjoy much without undue concern about it. The reason for this is that such a person is large. For someone to feel all the time that he has accomplished something is a characteristic of smallness.</P><P>A person who oversees God's people needs much wisdom, but the secret of wisdom is to have a large heart. I do want to spend quite a bit of time here with the brothers and sisters on the question of largeness of heart. You have no idea how much this matter affects those serving as elders. Many of your inaccurate judgments are caused by your narrow heart. On the surface it appears that you lack wisdom, but actually, the problem comes because your heart is narrow. When many matters are poorly managed, you may attribute the cause to your foolishness, but actually your foolishness comes from your narrow heart. If you would only enlarge your heart, immediately you would become a person of wisdom.</P><P>Therefore, brothers, learn to enlarge your heart in all things. For anyone to pretend to be large is pride. For anyone to strive to be large is presumptuous. We should never behave in that way, but in dealing with any matter, we must learn to enlarge ourselves. Whether in learning the truth, in seeking to be spiritual, in contacting the brothers and sisters, in discerning others, or in managing affairs, we must learn to be large. Whenever we touch the affairs of the church and whenever we touch any spiritual matter, we have to learn to be large in our heart. We need to continue to be large. Largeness can solve many problems.</P><P>Suppose today everyone else in the church knows about a certain matter, but this matter is concealed from you. In your heart would you blame others? If your heart is large, you will not do this. Otherwise, you will surely complain about it. Perhaps a brother offends you today. Are you able to let the matter go? It depends on whether your heart is large or small. Surely, if your heart is small, you will not be able to let it go. If it is large, you will be able to let it go. Everything in the church can be governed by this principle.</P><P>Between 1936 and 1937, for a year or two I worked frequently in a certain place in North China. At that time there was a group of brothers who were all lovable ones. Almost all of them loved the Lord, but the strange thing was that there was always trouble in that church. The ones who stirred up the trouble were not other brothers and sisters, but the few responsible ones. During that period I visited there once nearly every three or four weeks. Each time I went, I would release a few messages. After releasing the messages, I would call the responsible brothers together to fellowship and pray, and to solve the problem among them. But not too long after I left, trouble would arise again.</P><P>I remember clearly that it was there that I first spoke on David being the typical example of one who had experienced the cross. The Lord really gave me the light at that time, and I released some very strong words. The theme of the message that time touched on the point that a leading one must learn to choose and experience the cross. After the message was given, these few leading brothers all praised and thanked the Lord, and they thought their problem was solved. They all prayed together and shook hands with each other. I left there with much joy, feeling very happy that the problem in their midst was over. But in less than two or three weeks, news came that they were having trouble again.</P><P>If you study the cause of this trouble carefully, you would discover that it had nothing to do with their love for the Lord; every one of them loved the Lord. The strange thing, however, was that every one of the three or five responsible brothers was narrow-hearted. They argued over minute details in everything, whether big or small. Sometimes they would argue over the size of the opening for a door at the meeting hall. For example, one would say that it should be three feet wide, and another would say that it should be four feet. They were unwilling to yield to each other, and they made themselves very unhappy. Unfortunately, though I sensed a little of their difficulty, I was not yet able to speak a clear word due to my lack of experience. If the same thing were to happen today, I could clearly tell them that it is unnecessary for them to choose the cross or to be broken; all they need is to enlarge their heart.</P><P>	Brothers, there are difficulties in many local churches today because the elders do not have a large heart. Therefore, I fully agree that the elders in the different localities should go to visit other places. Those in Taipei should visit Tainan, Kaoshiung, and Hualien. Those in other places should also go out to visit. Once you visit another place, your heart will be enlarged. If circumstances allow, it would be even better to travel overseas. Once a man goes out for a visit, his heart will be enlarged. It is wrong to be proud, and it is wrong to be boastful. It is also wrong to strive to be large, but you must learn to enlarge your heart. It does not mean that to have a large heart is to be loose. You must still be strict with yourself, yet your heart toward others must be large.</P><P>Of course, the natural life can never learn this lesson. Often a natural man will make a pretension of trying to enlarge his heart. In order to enlarge our own heart, we need the Lord's abundant grace. Please remember that the ability to forgive others is a matter that has to do with the largeness of heart. The ability to bless the ones who curse us also has to do with a large heart. Your heart must be so large that whenever others offend you, you can forgive them as soon as they confess to you. Though others may persecute you and inflict harm on you, you can still love them. To be able to forgive others when they have offended you is something that has to do with a large heart.</P><P>Oh, the wisdom that comes from a large heart is immeasurable! In everything we do, it is right for us to be disciplined, and it is wrong to be presumptuous. But the most important thing is that our heart has to be large. If the heart is not large enough, you must prepare yourselves to make mistakes in the future; you will surely eat the fruit of regret. Suppose a brother asks you to do something today. If your heart is not large enough and you deny his request, you will surely regret it later. Or, if a brother asks for your forgiveness today, and you would not forgive him due to your narrowness in heart, you will surely regret it later. Therefore, brothers, your heart must be enlarged. We are narrow persons, but we must learn to enlarge our hearts. If you have an argument with a brother, eight or nine times out of ten it is because of the narrowness of your heart. In these years, I have not met many people with a large heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. BEING HONEST IN THE HEART</H2><P>Honesty here does not refer to the absence of lying and cheating. It refers to truthfulness and genuineness. It means to neither speak with twisting words nor exercise any tactfulness or manipulating. If things can be done, you simply do them. If they cannot be done, you simply do not do them. There is no maneuvering of tactfulness. In these years, I have seen many dishonest things among God's children. Sometimes, even when a brother gives you a piece of clothing, he is not being honest. Do you understand what I am saying? He gives you that piece of clothing, not because he loves you and feels that you need some clothing, but because he wants you to do something for him. He is afraid that you may not fulfill his request. That is why he gives you the piece of clothing. Please remember that this is something that comes from a dishonest heart. Among the Gentiles it would not be considered deceitful, but in the church this is dishonesty.</P><P>Many times those who are elders are too seasoned. Forgive me for saying this. They are far too seasoned, to the point that they have become crafty. Inwardly, such a one may not be at all satisfied with you, but outwardly, he is smiling. It is right for him not to lose his temper with others even when he is not satisfied with them, but neither should he pretend outwardly to be happy. This is falsehood. Such a one should have a sober attitude before others; he should make the others realize that he is not pleased. This is the right way. It is right for you not to lose your temper, but it is not right for you to pretend with a smiling face. You must behave yourself from an honest heart. In any social organization, people may pretend, and may exercise politics, and use manipulating. But the brothers and sisters, especially those who are elders, should only be genuine. We must learn to have an honest heart before God. Our words, our expression, our attitude, and our contacts with the brothers and sisters must all be genuine.</P><P>Brothers, whenever you are not genuine, it means that you have a motive, and to have a motive means that you are being political. In typology this is the leprosy on the garment as mentioned in Leviticus 13. If I give something to a brother, it should be because I have such a burden, feeling, and love from the Lord. What I do outwardly comes from what I have within. This is very beautiful. But if I never had such a burden, guidance, or love, it is leprosy to give a brother something in order to obligate him to do something for me in return. This must never be done. It may be done in society, but not in the church. I must repeat this again and again: it is true that we cannot lose our temper whenever we like, and we cannot speak carelessly, but at the same time we must not try to manipulate. Our outward attitude should manifest the inward condition of our heart. Never consider this matter lightly. If you want to be a genuine elder, you will find this lesson quite difficult to learn. To refrain from being political yet at the same time not lose your discipline before God is not an easy thing to do.</P><P>Brothers, you have to forgive me for saying this: sometimes when you become too seasoned in handling matters, you have in reality become a two-faced person. One of the faces is light, while the other is dark. In other words, one face is black and the other is white. This is not right. No elder can behave himself this way. This is equivalent to an elder having a double tongue and speaking two different kinds of words. An elder can only have one expression and one manifestation inwardly and outwardly. I hope all the brothers would learn this lesson.</P><P>All those who try to manipulate do so in order to evade and avoid difficulties. But the more you try to evade and avoid, the harder it is for you to deal with the problems. If you cannot confront them, it is better to leave them alone and allow them to surface by themselves. There is no need for you to deal with them. If you keep yourself genuine, many times difficulties will go away by themselves. I especially like the man Moses in the book of Numbers. He never manipulated anything among the Israelites. You have to admit that he had a great mind, and he was a man full of wisdom, insight, knowledge, and capability. In spite of this, you see him as a very simple person among the Israelites. He was a genuine person, and he had an honest heart. Some say that a simple person is a foolish one. We admit that this is true, but please remember this kind of foolishness is not bad foolishness, but good foolishness. You must learn to have a heart that is honest.</P><P>Some elders are obviously unhappy with a certain person. Yet they would not say so face to face, but would speak behind the person's back. This is not being honest. If you cannot say something before his face, you should not say it behind his back. If you cannot say it in the light, neither should you say it in the dark. Elders must learn to be honest to this extent. It is not wrong if you cannot say something face to face, for the environment or condition may not permit it. Furthermore, we must learn to live before God, because sometimes even God would not allow us to say it. But it is absolutely not right for you not to say something before a certain person's face, yet say it before others, or to paint a white picture in front of one person, yet paint a black one in front of another. All the elders who are a profit to the church are truthful ones. If I can speak something and I have the inner guidance to say it, I should say it. But if I cannot speak something and do not have the inner guidance to say it either, I should not say it. All that I say should be the same regardless to whom I say it&#151;whether to man, to God, or even to Satan. This is an elder. This type of honest person never fears confrontation. He speaks the same word to those who oppose him as to those who agree with him. He never fears confronting two opposing parties.</P><P>Brothers, do not think this lesson is easy to learn. I believe all of you desire to serve the Lord, and none of you are dishonest. But this refers to honesty in the general sense. The honesty we speak of today means more; it means to be without any skirting of issues or manipulating. I must learn only to be restrained by God and to live before Him. When it is yes, I say yes; when it is no, I say no. When it is permissible, I do it; when it is not permissible, I will not do it. Furthermore, whatever I do in public, I do the same in private. This is the honesty of which we speak. Only this kind of a heart can render the church real profit. The administration of the church is not a matter of speculation; you cannot play politics and think that as long as you are successful, nothing else matters. This will not work; it will never withstand the test of time. If you are a two-faced person, others may not know it at the time, yet given time, all will know. Time is the proof of all things. In order for the church to profit, an elder must learn to be a person with an honest heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. BEING UPRIGHT IN HEART</H2><P>When we say that the heart must be upright, we do not merely mean that it should not be crooked. We mean that there should not be any motive or aim in one's heart. For the elders to oversee the church, they must have a heart that can say before God that their help to the brothers and sisters and their leading of their spiritual pursuit are with absolutely no motive. This is what it means to be upright. Many times elders visit others with a motive. Sometimes they invite brothers to a love feast also with a motive. It seems that when they invite a person, that person is supposed to come under their control. This is to have a motive. It is politics. It is not uprightness. When we invite others to come to a love feast for fellowship, we should invite them only for this purpose. If we have some other motive, we should make it clear to them. This is to be upright. In the church, and especially with the leading ones and with those responsible for the administration, no one should take advantage of opportunities. Even if an opportunity is available, they should not take advantage of it. Otherwise, their heart is not upright.</P><P>For the elders to manage the affairs of the church, their heart must be upright, and their ways must also be upright. They must not walk a crooked path. Suppose you are in trouble with a brother and fail to find a solution to the problem. You may go to this one's brother-in-law to try to have the brother-in-law speak to this one's wife, hoping that she would in turn speak to the brother. This kind of thing should never be done. If you have the Lord's leading to speak to the brother-in-law, it is a different matter. But if not, you must never act like the worldly people, taking back doors and shortcuts.</P><P>I believe after I have spoken all these things, you can understand what I mean. The elders in the church must learn to enlarge their heart again and again. It is right for one not to be presumptuous, boastful, or desiring to be great. Yet at the same time, the heart must be enlarged. Meanwhile, the heart must be honest and upright, and you must not try to make use of others. If you need someone to help you with something, simply tell the other person plainly. If it is not convenient with the other person, you should not force the issue. Do not skirt the issues, and do not try to make use of others. We must deal with our heart before God to such an extent.</P><P>Originally, I intended to mention also that the heart must be pure. We do not need to speak about it now, because purity is included within honesty and uprightness. If you can be honest, truthful, upright, and straight, your heart will surely be pure. With this type of heart, God will have a way through you; He will be able to use you to oversee the church, and you will become a real profit to all the brothers and sisters.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CHARACTER OF AN ELDER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER</H2><P>In these first few messages, we are first considering the person of an elder. After this, we will consider the principle of administration in the church. I want to repeat soberly to the brothers and sisters that whether a matter is carried out in a good way or in a poor way depends absolutely on the person. Eighty to ninety percent of the success of a work depends on the person, the remaining ten to twenty percent on the method and principle. Therefore, the main problem in overseeing the church is the person. Today we will speak about character.</P><P>Character and habits are closely related. To speak of character is almost the same as to speak of habits. During the training in 1953, we stressed heavily the matter of character. Later at the training in Manila we spoke again on character with a few additional points. There were altogether thirty points, composed of ten groups with three points in each group. We have said that character differs from nature. Nature comes completely from the hereditary traits; it comes by birth. Character does not come only by birth; there is the question of habits also.</P><P>From our experience, a strict analysis of character shows that it is developed from our hereditary nature plus our habits. When we add habits to the nature received at birth, we have the fixed character of a person. However, within the character, the percentage of habit is higher than that of nature. Perhaps sixty to seventy percent of character is habit, and thirty to forty percent is nature. For example, two baby boys may be born of the same Chinese parents. But the older one may be brought into a Western family from birth and brought up and educated there, while the younger one may be born in China and raised up in a Chinese family. When they both grow up, the elder brother will fully manifest the Western character, while the younger will fully manifest the Chinese character. I believe all of you will accept this fact. Therefore, although character contains the element of nature, it is mostly developed from habits. Some are born slow; others are born quick. This is a difference in the hereditary nature. But some are slow by habit, and others are quick by habit. The difference is developed mostly from habits. The character we are speaking of is primarily related to our habits.</P><P>No one is ever free from the influence of his character in his walk and conduct. The walk and conduct of every person is definitely restricted by his character. This is inevitable. Of course, when a person is not broken, it is very difficult for him to be spiritual. If his heart has not been dealt with severely, it will not be sufficiently large, honest, and upright. All these surely will affect his walk. But there is one more point: no matter what kind of walk a person may have, he can never go beyond the boundary of his character. Everyone is restricted by his character. If it is your character to be a quick person, you cannot but work hastily. If your character is slow, you cannot but work at a slow pace. If your character is careless, you could never be serious in your work. If your character is inaccurate, you could never give a message with accuracy. This is absolutely true. Not only does character control the whole person as the heart does, but it is a person's whole world; it is his realm, and even his sphere. It is impossible for anyone to act outside of this realm. No matter how anyone walks and behaves, there is no way for him to go beyond the realm of his own character.</P><P>Therefore, experience has shown us that in order for the elders to be a true profit to the church, their character must be carefully considered. We all know that the demands upon a person's character increase as his undertaking becomes more lofty. If you are a man pulling a rickshaw or a man cleaning the street, the consideration of character is not so important. But if you undertake to do something higher, such as being a physician or a professor, then the demand for character becomes higher. Today, those brothers who are elders in the church and who oversee God's house are engaged in the highest undertaking in the universe. As such, they must pay full attention to the matter of character.</P><P>In this chapter we can only deal with a few points of character that are directly related to the administration of the elders. If you neglect these few points, no matter how well you pray and how spiritual you are, I can conclude that you will be ineffective as an elder; the situation of the church will be helpless under your hand. These few points are: thoroughness, diligence, steadfastness, concern for others, and being accommodating. Let us consider these points one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BEING THOROUGH</H2><P>The most important point of the elder's character is to be thorough and not careless. Brothers and sisters, if you have ever tried to be thorough, you will discover how much man is not at all thorough. Sometimes the elders have caused much confusion in the church among the brothers and sisters because of a lack of thoroughness. For example, some of the brothers and sisters may present a matter to you, but you merely listen casually to them and assume that you have understood clearly what they said. Actually, you have not listened clearly and accurately enough to the words of the brothers; you have not understood the meaning of their words. Consequently, by the time you deal with the matter, you can only deal with it in a general way. You may consider that the matter is generally taken care of, but actually, the matter is far from completed.</P><P>If you investigate a little, you will find out that most people are not thorough. For example, it is hard to find anyone among the brothers and sisters who can repeat another's words accurately. I may tell you something, and you may pass it on to someone else. The same word may pass through seven people. By the time it reaches the eighth person, the words will then differ very much from the words spoken by the first one. The second person may speak almost the same as the first. The third one may also speak more or less the same as the second. But by the time the words are relayed to the eighth person, the difference will be very great. Sometimes, when a brother passes on the words of another, a problem arises in the church. If you bring together the brother who initiated the words with the one who relayed those words, the two will quarrel with one another. One will say, "At such and such a time you spoke this word to me." The other will say, "No, the way I said it was thus and thus." Eventually you discover that neither is lying, and neither of them has any problem with their motives. The fact is that the one who speaks, speaks carelessly, and the one who listens, also listens carelessly. The two careless persons now form a pair. The one speaking does not speak correctly, and the other listening does not listen accurately. As a result, a problem arises. I do not know how many times I have confronted this kind of situation. From experience I know that I cannot hastily accept people's words, because their words are too inaccurate. The basic cause for their inaccuracy is the lack of thoroughness in their character.</P><P>I believe that we brothers do not need to look at others; we only need to look at ourselves. Let me mention one thing, the reading of the Scriptures. If you will check yourself concerning this matter, you will discover how lacking you are in thoroughness. Try to write down what you have comprehended in the first chapter of Genesis, and you will discover how your comprehension of Genesis 1 lacks thoroughness.</P><P>I can never forget an incident that took place when I was in Shanghai in 1947. One day I was sitting in the living room. Suddenly, a sister came rushing in and said, "Brother Lee! A terrible thing has happened! Upstairs in the ceiling a big hole like this is broken through." As she was speaking, she made a gesture with her hands. At that time, I was taken by surprise. I asked her, "How big?" She said, "This big!" The gesture with her hands was slightly smaller than before. We asked her again, "Really how big?" She said, "Like this." I asked again, "How big?" She said, "Nearly this big." Each time I asked, the hole she described became smaller and smaller. There were others sitting in the room with me. After I had asked five or six times, they began to laugh. Actually, if I remember correctly, the hole at that time was only the size of a penny. This seems like a joke, but if you test yourselves with this principle, you will then realize how inaccurate a person you are.</P><P>Sometimes a brother may tell me, "Oh, Brother Lee, Brother So-and-so has a high fever." I would ask, "What is the temperature?" He would say, "I will go and measure it." After a while he would return and would say, "I have measured it. It is only 37.5 C." Then I would go and measure it myself. It would turn out to be only 37.3 C., even less than 37.5 C. You see how inaccurate one can be even in taking body temperature. Do not think I am just joking. This actually happened.</P><P>When I was in mainland China, sometimes I would go to a place to work and to hold conferences. I asked the responsible brothers how many could be seated in their meeting hall. One elder said, "It can seat 250." Another elder said, "It can seat approximately 450." Still another said, "We have only 220 seats." When I heard this, I was utterly confused. Was it 250, 450, or 220? How many seats were there after all? After much questioning, I still could not get an exact number.</P><P>Never consider this to be a small matter. The elders must have a character that is very thorough. Otherwise, sooner or later, everything in the church under your hand will become a problem. In the church, no matter what is placed in the hands of a careless person, it will become a problem. In managing things, negotiating matters, passing on words, or solving others' problems, our character needs to be thorough.</P><P>When a brother tells you his spiritual problem, you cannot listen to it carelessly. You must listen seriously to it like a physician. We often say that a good physician must be fine in his heart and bold in his courage. This fineness is a matter of character. You must be very fine and very serious. When a brother or a sister speaks to you concerning the problems of others, he or she may be careless in speaking. However, you must listen seriously and even inquire seriously. Occasionally, a sister may come to you and say, "Oh, how terrible is my husband!" If you say, "Wait until I get a piece of paper so that I can write down what you say," you can be sure that if you put the paper on the table and write down point by point what she says, she will change her tone. It does not mean that she has originally intended to lie, but it means that she is careless. When she sees that you are seriously taking notes, she will then speak seriously. After she is finished speaking, you may nail the matter down further: "Did you say that he came home at 12 o'clock last night?" She may say, "Yes, it was 12 o'clock..Oh, no! Maybe it was a little past ten." You may say, "Did you say he spent $2,000?" She may say, "Well, maybe about $1,200." If you pin her down a little, she will change her tone. Things like this have actually happened. If you are not thorough in this way and you merely sit there listening, she may speak something up in the air. If you believe every word she says, you can never help her solve her family problem.</P><P>Even in listening to the truth and to God's word, we often hear inaccurately. If you do not believe me, please repeat what you have heard. You will find out that the message was given one way, and when you repeat it, it takes on another form. We often record our messages on the tape recorder here. It is best after you have heard a message to repeat it once to yourself, then compare it with a recording of that message. You will find out there is a vast difference. What is the reason for such inaccuracy? It is simply the problem of character; you are a person who is not thorough. I can only touch the principle. I believe that the brothers and sisters can apply it to their practical daily living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. BEING DILIGENT</H2><P>In addition, an elder must not be slothful. A slothful elder in a local church brings that church under a curse. It can be compared to what happens in a family; if the parents are lazy, it is a punishment to the children. The elders must have a diligent character. Anything in the hands of a slothful man will be delayed and cannot be depended on. All those who know how to work know that success in every task depends on the seizing of time. What is an opportunity? Opportunity is the seizing of time. When you seize the time, you gain the opportunity. When you let time slip by, you lose the opportunity. Whoever can seize time is a diligent person.</P><P>If you read through the Old Testament and then the New Testament, you will realize that everyone who serves the Lord has a distinctive character, one of diligence. If you want to manage the church well, you must exercise yourself to have a diligent character. Once a matter is placed in your hands, you should not place it on the shelf. Everything in our hands must be carried out diligently.</P><P>A diligent character is ninety percent developed through habit. Some people were not born lazy, but they have developed a lazy habit. As a result, they bear a lazy character. Slothfulness is a serious matter. If you allow slothfulness to have its way, it will make you more slothful. No wonder Solomon said that the sluggard buries his hand in the dish and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. Consider the extent to which a person's slothfulness may carry him! Whenever I read Solomon's description of slothfulness in Proverbs, I cannot help but laugh. He described how a lazy man is good at finding excuses. For example, if you want such a man to run an errand down the street, he would say that he does not want to go down the street, for there is a lion on the street. Whenever I read this, I always laugh. This is truly a good excuse! You may remember another way he described a slothful man, that he wallows on his bed like the door turns upon its hinges. These are all Solomon's descriptions. He showed us that if slothfulness becomes our habit, it can become very harmful.</P><P>I wish to tell the brothers and sisters that if you wish to overcome your slothfulness and develop the habit of diligence, you must start from your own personal matters, both great and small. In some places, I said this to the young people: "If I see that your shoes are unpolished and dusty, I know that you must be a lazy person." You may say that you do not have time. This is an excuse. I must tell you that you have time no matter how little time you have. It takes only a few seconds to clean a pair of shoes. There is an old saying: "Slothfulness and uncleanness are twin sisters." Wherever you find a place that is unclean, you know that a lazy man has been there. What is uncleanness? Uncleanness is to leave everything as it is. When you visit some churches, you will find the condition there is one that is unclean. By unclean, I do not mean that it is filthy or dirty; I mean that things there are messy, disorderly, and lacking in management. This condition simply proves that the elders there are lazy.</P><P>I have been to some local churches and have met some elders who, if I suggest some meetings on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings, would frown at the idea and say, "I am afraid that the brothers and sisters may not be able to take it." Let me tell you that it is not the brothers and sisters but the elders who cannot take it. They may say, "Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday seem too much. Perhaps we can keep the Tuesday and Thursday only." I may then ask, "What then should we do in these meetings? Should we pray, study the Word, or fellowship?" The lazy ones always have their way. They may say, "An hour and a half is too long. One hour is good enough, with half an hour for prayer and half an hour for studying the Bible. In this way, we have the study of the Word, and we have prayer, and we get two things done at the same time. This will also save the brothers' and sisters' time in traveling." This word sounds good, but every time I hear such a word, I shake my head and say to myself, "This church is in trouble, because the elders are lazy."</P><P>I have also met some diligent people. For example, you may go to a local church and say to the elders there, "It would be best if we can have two meetings each week, on Tuesday and Thursday." They may answer, "Brother, how about Saturday?" You can see that their eyebrows are raised. If you say, "I am afraid it may be too much," they will say, "Brother, not at all. We can meet every evening." From this, you can see that with the same question, diligent ones and lazy ones respond with different tones and different suggestions. A lazy man has a lazy view, whereas a diligent man has a diligent view.</P><P>Moreover, if you put something into the hands of a lazy man, he will surely make an important matter look small, and a small matter to be nothing. If the same matter is placed in the hand of a diligent man, he will make something out of nothing, and will make a small thing into something big. The more he lays his hands on things, the more things there will be. If you do not believe me, simply try the matter out. Sometimes a brother or sister would come to advise me, "Brother Lee, try to make the Scripture a little simpler." I would answer in return, "Do you want me to be a lazy man? I can be very simple and finish the book of Numbers in fifteen minutes. The first chapter deals with the forming of an army, and the last chapter deals with the ordinances concerning the inheritance of the women to the east of the River Jordan. Hence, the book of Numbers is simply the forming of the army and the apportioning of the inheritance!"</P><P>Please remember that with anything in this entire world everything can be simplified to the degree that it can be finished in an hour. At the same time, it can also be extended to the point that it can go on for a whole lifetime. The range is very great. It all depends upon whether you are diligent or lazy. When a diligent person solves the problem of a brother, he solves it diligently, and not in a simple way. But when a lazy man tries to solve the same problem, he does it in a lazy way; to him, everything is easy and can be done quickly.</P><P>I can tell you that I am a person who writes letters often and receives much mail from brothers and sisters. Sometimes, after looking at a brother's letter, I cannot help but laugh. To me, it would have been better for this brother to send a telegram rather than write a letter. If you ask him why he writes so little, he would say that he does not have anything to say, and that what he has written is good enough. This is laziness. Anyone who is not lazy can find much to write about.</P><P>Once, a brother who was responsible for the co-workers' dormitory spoke to others in my presence, "Whoever manages the dormitory cannot possibly bear Brother Lee. Today he comes and asks for all the bedspreads to be changed and the desks to be moved. The next day he asks for all the mattresses to be turned over. I simply cannot stand it." However, I wish to tell you that this is not a matter of being able or unable to tolerate something. Rather, it is a matter of slothfulness or diligence. If you are slothful, you will not be able to bear even work that is lighter. If you are diligent, even work that is heavier is acceptable.</P><P>If you visit a local church, you will know whether the elders there are diligent or slothful. Sometimes, when you go to a local church and observe the condition there, you will find out that the gospel has not been preached as it ought to have been preached, and the saints have not been edified as they ought to have been edified. Visitations have not been made as they ought to have been made, and many backsliders have not been sought out as they ought to have been sought out. In spite of all these things, the elders nevertheless have peace day after day. When meetings are being considered, these elders would wish that an hour-and-a-half meeting would be shortened to one hour. These elders are like hired workers. Everyone who manages his own store or who works in an office has to take his business seriously; he has to work with longsuffering and utmost diligence. When his business requires nine hours, he spends ten hours. When it requires ten hours, he spends twelve hours. When it requires twelve hours, he spends fifteen hours. This was what I saw with the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. In the morning, before any of the employees arrive, they arrive early at the place of business and take the lead to work. They stay until 11 p.m. or 12 p.m. before returning home. No wonder they make a success in their business.</P><P>Brothers, never think that all you have to do in overseeing a church is to pray a little and wait for the Lord a little and expect God to do it all for you. There is no such thing. God will never perform such a miracle. To manage the church is like managing a family. All the sisters who manage their homes know that whether a home is large or small, they can never get their job done, even when they put all their time into it. However, a person may do nothing around the house, and she can still call it her home. But there is a great difference between one home and another. Likewise, a church is a church, whether it is managed by diligent ones or slothful ones, but there can be vast differences between one church and another.</P><P>When a church is in the hands of some elders who are slothful, it is impossible for that church to go on. No matter what wonderful truths, principles, and methods are entrusted to them, the church will still have no way to go on, because slothfulness damages everything. Therefore, every elder must exercise to be diligent. When anyone becomes an elder, he is not there merely to mark time, but to do business. In doing business, a person is not concerned with time. Whenever a matter comes to his attention, he must deal with it and manage it diligently.</P><P>The result of this diligence is to make the weakest person the most successful one. There is a Chinese saying&#151;"Better to go slowly than to stand still." Even though you may be very timid, as long as you go on diligently to oversee and to manage, you will see the church being led in an orderly way and on the right track. On the other hand, if the elders are lazy, everything will be frustrated. No matter how spiritual an elder is, it will still be of no avail. When a church is placed in the hands of a lazy person, it is doomed to desolation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. BEING STABLE</H2><P>To be stable means that you do not change easily. For example, you should not place a sister in responsibility over a district, and then remove her after two weeks. Or, you should not make a decision to carry out some task only to waver when difficulty arises. All this speaks of instability. A stable person is not like this. He does not trust a person easily, but once he has trusted someone, he will not easily change. He does not make decisions easily, but once he has made a decision, he deals with problems steadily without panic, despite any difficulty that may arise. If elders do not possess this kind of stable character, they will cause trouble to the church, and there will be no way to go on.</P><P>A stable character does not come mainly by birth; rather, it comes mostly through discipline. For example, a word may have come to you; you have heard it, but you do not make a final decision about it until you have considered it well and have taken suggestions from all sides. You may need to write an essay. After you have finished the first draft, it is best to lay it aside for a couple of days and then to read it again. By that time, circumstances may change, or your thought may become clearer and your observation more accurate. Experience tells us that the weightier a matter is, the more there is the need for one to be stable. For you to be ever so slightly careless will result in some deficiencies and may even bring you into trouble.</P><P>We all have to admit that no matter how fine we are, it is nevertheless not easy to make an accurate judgment when confronted with certain matters. Therefore, we must learn to be stable. Do not easily believe or disbelieve. Do not believe too hastily or too slowly. Do not quickly say that someone is good or is bad. When you say that someone is good, you have to remember that he is still the descendant of Adam, and that no matter how good he is, he still has some corrupt elements. At the same time, when you repeatedly say that someone is not good, remember that as a part of God's creation, he still has his good elements. This is especially true for one who has been saved by God's grace. Therefore, no one is absolutely good or bad. Once you believe in something absolutely, you fall into an unstable position. Perhaps you will consider this as being careful, but this is much more than merely being careful.</P><P>When a problem arises in the church, and it appears that you need to deal with it, deal with it you must, but you should not panic or be hasty. You should first calm down before trying to deal with it. When you are in an unstable condition, do not attempt to deal with it. Especially the elders in a large local church must exercise to have this kind of stable character. Everything that passes through your hands must be weighed calmly. Although you may have one hundred percent trust in a brother, while you are trusting, you have to be considering at the same time. Do not put your trust in others all at once; put your trust in them a little at a time. In some situations, you need to allow the other person to manifest himself a little, then put your trust in him slowly. If you see anything unsafe, withdraw immediately. We must learn this lesson of being stable.</P><P>The thing everyone fears the most in the church is fluctuation; it bothers people to see things changing back and forth. Before you are clear about a particular matter, go slowly. Do not be too quick. Once you make a hasty decision, it is difficult to retract it. In a district meeting, the responsible brothers and sisters must hold fast this principle. You must listen quickly, but believe slowly. Whatever may happen, listen quickly, but pass it on slowly. Things may be passed on to me, but it should not be easy for me to pass them on to others. If I am not sure and not clear as to the consequence of a matter, I should not say anything about it. All of this is included in the principle of being stable.</P><P>If you lay hold of this principle, you as an elder in the church will not be changing back and forth every time the wind blows. Many people can offer their opinions to you, but you will not lightly express your view. Unless you are very sure, you will not speak. You will not make any judgment on any matter concerning right or wrong&#151;not because the matter is difficult to discern, but because your character is stable.</P><P>Brothers, do not consider matters too simply. In the past years, I myself have suffered great loss and great pain through slight negligence in some things. Once there is a change, there is a great loss. When I suffer a loss, the consequences are not that great; but if the church suffers a loss, the consequences are tremendous. Therefore, we must learn to be careful and must study a matter carefully and thoroughly before making a decision. Never change back and forth every time the wind blows.</P><P>The same principle also applies to our coordination with the brothers and sisters in the work. Never think that you can coordinate with one person today and change to another person tomorrow. You should never do this. Either we do not coordinate, or if we do, we have to be like Caleb and Joshua, coordinating with each other until death. If a brother who serves in the church becomes very intimate with one brother this month, but dissociates himself from that one the very next month, all the while associating himself intimately with a third brother, such a person is too unstable and is without much use. A stable person will never coordinate with anyone easily, but once he coordinates with someone, he will not change until death.</P><P>Sometimes, when words of persecution, opposition, or other kinds of rumors come, you should not accept them too quickly. When an unstable person is blown by the wind from the outside, he falls. In 1943, I was in North China. Part of the work there was greatly blessed by the Lord. At the peak of the blessing, suddenly a wind of rumor blew into our ears. If I had not exercised stability at that time, not only one person, but ten people, would have fainted. Concerning this kind of thing, our attitude must be calm. To panic would not lessen the difficulty; rather, it would only intensify it. The more problems the church has, the more stable we need to be. Whether the problem comes from inside or outside, once it happens, we must learn to be stable. When we are stable, the situation will be cleared up.</P><P>Frequently, problems in the church come from the panicking of elders who are unstable in character. Things may not have been so serious at the beginning, but an unstable character makes things worse and rumors multiply. On the other hand, if one is stable and silent, he will see that the rumors will gradually subside. Even when a brother falls, you must not be anxious. Do not tell others right away, saying, "Brother So-and-so, who is responsible in a district, has gone to see a movie." Perhaps he just went once to see a movie, but you tell others a hundred times. This will cause a storm. There is no need for you to shout this way. You must learn to be stable, and to wait and see. When you are stable in this way, you will be led by the Lord to know how to help him. All accurate leadings, feelings, and burdens are obtained by those who are stable before God.</P><P>One of the things Satan likes the most is to see us being unstable. He likes to stir up a storm. The more you argue, the happier he is. The more you panic, the happier he becomes. The more rumors you spread, the happier he is. When one elder finds out that a brother is going to a movie, he hurries to tell another elder. This second elder reacts immediately, "Oh, how terrible! This is too bad!" The visit to the movie may not have been so bad at the beginning; what really makes it bad is a few elders helping Satan to throw in the stones. In the end, there is no more peace. Therefore, we must learn how to deal with Satan's disturbance here. No matter how many stones are thrown into this lake of mine, my lake still remains calm. No matter how much trouble you stir up, I am still stable. A thousand words cannot move me one bit. To be hardened at heart is wrong, and to be stiff-necked is also wrong, but you should learn to be stable. Without such a character, you have no backbone. When the east wind blows, you go to the west. When the west wind blows, you fall to the east. A person who does not have a backbone cannot manage the church.</P><P>I want to reaffirm to you brothers and sisters that everything can be solved if we are willing to wait a little. Time is often the salvation sent by God. Let us consider again the matter of preaching. If due to laziness we do not want to preach, that is a great loss. However, if due to our cautiousness we wait again and again before we preach, this is a great profit. It is one thing to put off preaching because of laziness; it is another thing to wait for the sake of caution. Even in visitation we cannot be too hasty. We must also wait to see if the feeling to visit changes or not. Experience tells us that if you visit in such a stable way, often you will see that such a visitation comes at the right time and has the Lord's presence within it. Therefore, we must learn not to panic or to be upset and hasty. Unless we are very sure of a matter, we must not make quick judgments. All this is part of a stable character.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. HAVING A CONCERN FOR OTHERS</H2><P>A person who has no concern for others cannot serve the Lord, much less be an elder. If an elder is afraid of being bothered, it is best for him not to be an elder. An elder is like a father or mother in a family. Parenthood is the most bothersome responsibility. The more an elder is willing to be bothered, the better he will function. If a brother comes to you today, a sister comes tomorrow, an unemployed person the third day, and if people come to you when they quarrel, when they are sick, when they need to buy a coffin, or a grave site, or when they do not know how to read the Bible or cannot have their prayers answered&#151;if all these ones come to you&#151;you are functioning quite well as an elder. But if no one ever comes to you, I think you should not be an elder any longer.</P><P>The secret to having others come to you is to have a concern for them. Once you have a concern for others, they will surely come to you. You have no idea how much help people need today. Strong ones never consider how the weak ones need help! Not only on important issues such as marriage, schooling, and employment, but even on trivial matters, the brothers and sisters need help. Some become ill and need to find a doctor. Even in the matter of finding the right doctor, there is the need of help.</P><P>The worldly people do not care much about fellowship, but we Christians are the people that care the most about fellowship. If you want to see a doctor and you can first have some fellowship with the elders, you will surely be blessed. If you want to rent a house and can first have some fellowship with the elders, you will also surely be blessed. Some brothers are really good elders; when others fellowship with them about renting a house, they can immediately ask a lot of questions. They may check to see if there is electricity and water, if transportation is convenient, if the place is close to the market, to the school, and what kind of people the neighbors are. They may check in detail on the kind of people living upstairs and those living downstairs, how is the entrance to the place and the exit from it, and how good is the security. If the brother says that there is a dance hall next door, the elder would at once reply, "How can you live next door to a dance hall? Do you want your children to learn to dance?" You can see that this is genuine help. Some do not have that much common sense and do not consider things thoroughly. Therefore, they need the help of an elder.</P><P>Some elders are really like parents. When you present a matter to such an elder, immediately he will consider everything for you. Perhaps you are considering the matter of marriage. While you are still getting acquainted with the other party, you decide to go to an elder. The elder will bring up many questions which are a great help to you. For example, he may discuss with you the kind of mate you should choose, the way you should contact the other party, and the circumstances under which you should contact the other party. These deal with the human side. In terms of godliness before God, he considers for you the proper way to maintain propriety. This is a very great help. If each local church can have more elders who are like this, it will truly be a blessing to all the brothers and sisters.</P><P>All these matters depend on a concern for others. If you feel that you are the elders, and that all you have to do is go to the meetings and make a few announcements, such an attitude will disqualify you from being an elder. An elder should not wait for others to come and ask, but should have a constant concern for others. After the last baptism, suppose eight brothers were assigned to my district. As a responsible one of this district, I should pay attention to these eight brothers concerning such matters as their family background, their marriages, and their educational background. Once I pay attention to them, I may find out that two young brothers are single and have recently graduated from college. My concern must be diligent and stable as well. I must be very concerned for them and very attentive to them. I must take note of the way they live and walk. Perhaps in the beginning, I may not have much assurance, but after observing them for a considerable period of time, up to a certain point I may have the assurance to find a match for them. If you function in this way as an elder, in the long run the brothers and sisters cannot help but come to you. Surely they will come to you.</P><P>I really wish that the brothers and sisters in the church could come to the elders on any matter, whether large or small, spiritual, family, business, or having to do with one's daily living. That would truly be wonderful. In principle, the responsible ones for the districts should be the same as the elders; they should also care for the brothers and sisters as in a family. This is a blessed work. You have no idea how much blessing is in it.</P><P>But please remember, this should not be something that we do out of our natural disposition. The desire to be involved in others' business and to inquire about others' affairs is of the flesh. The right way is for us to learn the lesson before the Lord and to accept a burden to be a shepherd among His children, one who cares for the souls of men. It is because you love them and are concerned for them that you have such a burden upon you. If an elder can do this, the church will surely be blessed. Today, the greatest lack in every local church is this kind of elders. Such ones are not inquisitive concerning others' affairs, but they do have a character of being concerned for others. This is the right character that an elder should have in his shepherding and teaching of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. BEING ACCOMMODATING</H2><P>An elder should have still another item of character, that of accommodating others. I have mentioned this point before and have called this character trait one that can be compared to glue; glue may be applied to a horizontal surface, a vertical body, a bump, a hole, or a corner. It can be accommodated to fit any shape. Whether an object is a bump or a hole, crooked or straight, level or slanted, it can be applied to it. An elder must be able to accommodate others in a similar way. However, although we speak of accommodation, this should not be something done artificially.</P><P>An elder must have a thorough, diligent, and stable character. He must be concerned for others and must be accommodating. If you have these five elements in your character, you will definitely manage a church well. I am not denying the importance of being spiritual, of which I have already spoken much. But if you are really spiritual, yet you lack these few character traits, your spirituality is still useless, and it still amounts to nothing. Spirituality can be compared to the ingredients, whereas character is the man himself behind the ingredients. Man's character is composed of his natural disposition plus his habits. The character represents the person. If you are slow, it is the person who is slow. If you are fast, it is the person who is fast. If you are careless, it is the person who is careless. If you are thorough, it is the person who is thorough. You are such a person because you are constituted with such a character. A person may not necessarily produce something good simply because the ingredients are good; much depends on the worker who works on the ingredients. If your character is poor, even if you have spiritual experiences, there will be no way for them to be applied.</P><P>Dear brothers and sisters, this is not a great doctrine. However, I have full assurance, and I can lay down my life to guarantee that if an elder is not a thorough, diligent, stable person, and is not concerned for others, neither accommodating others all the time, he will never function well as an elder. To have such elders in a church is like having no elders at all. Only those elders who are thorough, diligent, stable, concerned for others' affairs, and trying their best to accommodate others will be able to manage a church. Once we have such elders, we can thank and praise the Lord, for that church will surely have a bright future, and much spiritual blessing will be brought in.</P><P>Brothers, the elders among us are not professionals; they serve altogether out of love. We function as elders because we love the Lord, the church, and every member of His Body. Even if we pour out all the days of our life and our very life itself upon the church, it is worthwhile, and we are still willing to do it. This matter is bound up with the salvation of millions of souls; it is also bound up with the building up of millions of souls. How exceedingly glorious a work this is!</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KNOWLEDGE OF AUTHORITY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. AUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATION</H2><P>Whenever we talk about the administration of the church, we should consider the question of authority. Without authority, there is no administration. Whether it is the administration of a group of people or the administration of a place, there is the need for authority. If you examine the affairs conducted among mankind, you will discover that there is hardly an issue which does not involve authority. This is quite amazing. Actually, it should not be amazing, because God has ordained it this way. For instance, a maid may be hired to work for you in your kitchen. Even here, there is the question of authority. On one hand, you give her the authority to manage the kitchen; on the other hand, you also become the authority over her. Although she only performs such menial tasks as those pertaining to the kitchen, there is authority above her, and at the same time there is authority in her hand. Strictly speaking, the authority in her hand is the same authority over her. If she does not acknowledge the authority over her, she will lose the authority in her hand immediately. This is very clear. If she does not acknowledge you as her employer, or if she denies your authority over her, immediately she will lose her authority to work in your kitchen. Although cooking in a kitchen is a very menial task, authority is involved in it.</P><P>Suppose two brothers in a meeting hall are responsible for the cleaning of the hall throughout the year. If you look into this matter carefully, you will realize that authority is also there. When the responsible brothers assigned these brothers to the cleaning work, they were given authority to open and lock the doors in order to manage the cleaning of the hall. When they want to close the doors, you and I have no right to interfere, because they have this authority. Where does this authority come from? It comes from the responsible brothers. The responsible brothers have given them this authority; at the same time, they also have become their authority. If they do not accept the authority of the elders, they will at once lose this cleaning authority. Once they reject the authority over them, immediately they will lose the authority in their hand. You can see the matter of authority even in such a work.</P><P>This is true not only in the home and in the church, but everywhere. There is no way to avoid this consideration of authority, whether in the school, in the office, in the factory, or in any organization. Once authority is removed from human society, it will be impossible to organize people together. This is a sure principle.</P><P>Among all of mankind, nothing is more noble than the administration of God's house. Of course, such a noble task can never be carried out without authority. If authority is taken away from a church, there will be no way to administrate and manage the church. It will be useless to talk about anything else. To administrate is to rule, and to manage is to arrange. Without authority, there will be no way for anyone to administrate and manage. Perhaps you can do something haphazardly, but you can never administrate affairs and conduct them on the right track. In order to conduct matters on the right track, there is no way to dispense with authority.</P><P>How regrettable it is that Protestantism has been affected by the poison of Catholicism, which has an abnormal concept of authority. Authority in Catholicism is something abnormal. As a result of this, those who belong to God have a very bad impression concerning this matter. They think that there should not be any authority among God's children. To them, once authority comes in, there is Catholicism, and it becomes organized Christianity. God's children are greatly affected because of the background of the abnormal concept of authority in both Catholicism and Protestantism. They regard authority with considerable misunderstanding and contempt. Nevertheless, brothers, we have to admit before the Lord that as long as there is a church, there is the need for administration, and, as long as there is administration, there is the need for authority. Whether the authority is exercised normally or abnormally is a different matter. The need for authority is the main issue. Therefore, unless we ignore the administration of the church altogether, it is impossible to neglect the question of authority or to despise it.</P><P>Please forgive me for saying that when I was a young Christian, I too somewhat had the thought that the question of authority should not be brought up among God's children. I thought that in Matthew 20 the Lord has clearly told us that among the Gentiles there are rulers and officials, but among us it should not be so because we are brothers. This is right in one sense. However, we must admit that there are two sides to all truths in the Scriptures and that the two sides balance each other. At the beginning, we thought that authority could be dispensed with altogether, because the matter was so abnormal in Catholicism and Protestantism. From the Bible, we also found the Lord's words that we are all brothers; no one should rule over you, and no one should rule over me. If anyone is to rule over us, it can only be the Lord Himself. Who can be a substitute for the Lord in ruling over others? Whoever wants to rule violates the lordship of the Lord and usurps His position. This is really a blasphemy to the Lord. Such a statement has its point, and it is not altogether wrong, but we need to see the other side. Gradually, due to our love for the Lord, we realized more of the spiritual life and saw the light concerning the church and the Body of Christ. Then we saw that if you and I are merely brothers, there may be no need of authority, but we are also members one of another in His Body. Thus, the question of coordination is brought in. Of course, I do not mean that with the brothers there is no need of authority. Gradually, you will realize that even as brothers there is the need of authority. However, the most obvious place where authority is required is in the mutual coordination of the members in His Body. This is a corporate matter, a church matter. In the church there must be authority. Once we pay attention to the matter of the church, we have no choice but to face the issue of administration. Once administration is brought in, we have to confront the practical problems.</P><P>I still remember clearly that thirty years ago a group of us in North China was raised up; we cast away organized Christianity and came together to meet. When we first came together, we said, "We are all brothers. Only the Lord is our Head. We do not want man to rule over us." Gradually, however, practical issues arose. For example, how should we arrange the chairs for the meeting? The brothers insisted to do it one way, and the sisters insisted on another way. With a few brothers and sisters there were a few different ways of arrangement. How were we to solve the problem? If we were to use the democratic way, we could first have everyone express his opinion and then have everyone vote by the raising of hands; if the number were in the majority, the resolution would be passed. However, not only is there no such example in the Bible; even we ourselves did not have the peace and assurance within. Here was a practical problem which we could not deny.</P><P>After some days, we brought some to salvation. When they needed to be baptized, the practical problem came. Should they be baptized in the sea? Should they be baptized in the river? Or should they be baptized in a tub in a house? If only a dozen people in the meeting were to express their opinions, the discussion would go on until the end of the world. If some were given the opportunity to express their opinion, they would propose baptizing them in the river. Yet others would say that this is too troublesome, and that it is not a matter of form but a matter of spiritual reality, and as such, sprinkling is good enough. I do not have to go on. All of you brothers can realize that even with this small matter, if every brother and sister has a say, there will be no end of all the different kinds of discussion. What shall we do? Here again you see a practical problem.</P><P>How should we solve these practical problems? Among the people of the world, they can solve problems by councils, but in the church, we cannot do what they do. The people of the world can vote and contend with one another, but in the church we can never do this. It is unfortunate that in today's so-called Christianity, this is actually being practiced. This is indeed a disgrace! Some Christian organizations elect directors, deacons, and officials. Those who wish to be elected would then privately run for their office. Let me ask the brothers, "In God's church, can we tolerate such activity?" Absolutely not! Please remember, if we had an election, Paul, James, and John would all withdraw. Only Judas would come out to run. If that were the case, the church would be administered by a group of people like Judas. The more spiritual a person is and the more he knows the Lord, the more he is unwilling to win something for himself with his own hand. Therefore, the system of councils will not work in the church. Not only will elections be objectionable, but when brothers come together to discuss matters and there is a dispute, those who know God more will not want to contend; the more they know God, the more they will try to hold back their words. Not until others have finished talking will they give God a chance to speak. Therefore, it is clear that this way of election will not work. Not only can we not find such an example in the Bible, but our spirit senses no peace in doing this. How then can we solve this problem? Spontaneously, the matter of authority comes in.</P><P>Praise the Lord, though such leading and teaching was not among us at the very beginning, yet in fact the matter of authority was there. This was the way we began in North China and in South China. In the North, during the early days, I did see such a condition. There was neither a council nor a discussion; spontaneously, authority was there. For instance, with the arrangement of chairs, when the brothers and sisters came together, there was no discussion or contention; spontaneously some would begin to share their feeling about the matter. After this, one or two brothers who were the authority would say, "Good. We will arrange our chairs this way." Once they spoke, no one would say anything more. When it was time for a baptism, another opportunity was given to brothers and sisters to share their feeling. Some would say, "It is best to go to the river." Others would say, "The sea would be even better." Still others would say, "It is better to do it in a home." However, in the end, a brother would finally stand up to speak, "According to our present condition, we only need a pool at someone's home." By this time those who wanted to go to the sea would have nothing to say, and those who wanted to go to the river would also have nothing to say. Everyone would serve happily together in the baptismal service. You can see authority here. I mention these few examples to show you that without authority, everything would be in disorder. With authority, everything will be on the track.</P><P>Consider the church in Taipei. There are more than eight thousand brothers and sisters on our list. Regular attendance averages between two to three thousand. What is the way to manage such a large church? Here is fully the question of authority. I wish the brothers and sisters to see that to oversee a church, there is no way to avoid the question of authority. Once we reject authority, it is better to have no church at all; it is better for you to be a Christian by yourself and for me to be one by myself. If the time is convenient, we can be acquainted with one another as friends. You can share with me what you read from the Scriptures one day, and I can share with you what I read from the Scriptures another day. You can invite me for dinner, and I can invite you to lunch. We can have this kind of so-called fellowship. Without authority, our relationship can only come this far. If you want the church, however, there is no other way but to have administration. Once there is administration, immediately there is the matter of authority.</P><P>By this time, we should be clear that apart from the church, God's purpose can never be accomplished on earth. Apart from the church, it would be difficult for God's children to receive God's grace and enjoy His riches. In order to fulfill these matters, there must be the church; otherwise, all will come to nothing. I believe the brothers and sisters can realize this without my speaking further. We must have the church; hence, we must have administration. Certainly, what follows is that we must have authority. In order for the elders to administrate the church, there is no way to avoid authority. Once they forsake authority, immediately there is no administration, and hence no church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. KNOWING AUTHORITY</H2><P>To know authority here means to touch authority. Therefore, the term "knowing" is used in a very particular sense. From my experience I would like to testify to the brothers and sisters from the deepest part of my inner being that I sincerely believe in this matter. If a child of God truly wants to follow the Lord, sooner or later he will have to confront the matter of authority in his own experience. There is such a thing called authority that all must confront. Ordinarily, when we speak of knowing authority, it means to have a little knowledge about authority, but this is not what I am speaking of here. The knowledge of authority that I am speaking of here refers to a person's touching of the very thing called authority. God will eventually cause one who truly administrates and builds the church to confront authority. He will discover the fact that whenever he sins against authority or seeks to destroy it, it is much the same as if he had lost his own life. When he damages authority or has conflict with authority, he will not only find it hard to go on in his service, but he will have difficulties in his Christian life.</P><P>Authority is something that is very difficult to explain. For the time being, let me first explain what it means to touch authority. For instance, some time ago a serious case of smuggling was reported in the newspaper. When the smuggler was smuggling, he too had a sense of authority. He knew he was smuggling, and he knew this was against the authority. However, although he had this sense, he had not yet touched authority. Not until the day when his smuggling was discovered and the government ordered his arrest was he confronted with such a thing as authority. He hid himself here and there, and he was afraid of the policemen. Actually, the policemen had nothing to do with him. However, they represented authority. Since the smuggler had violated authority, it was impossible for him to live a normal life.</P><P>Take another example. A son who behaves properly before his parents may not sense the authority of the parents, but when he is in trouble with them, he immediately touches authority. Do not say that only ten-year-old children will find it difficult to go on when they are in trouble with their parents. Even a fifty-year-old adult will feel something wrong with himself as a person when he is in trouble with his parents, because the parents are still his authority. In his parents he confronts authority.</P><P>I do not know if the brothers and sisters can understand this matter when I explain it this way. Please remember that if you want to truly go on in the way of following the Lord and serving Him, sooner or later the Lord will cause you to confront authority. You can be "naughty" in many other things, but if you touch authority, you will know yourself that there will be no way for you to go on in life if you are "naughty" in this matter. Neither will you be able to live a proper life before God. Perhaps you can still serve a little, but you will find that the feeling is not quite pleasant. Perhaps you can still read the Bible, pray, and even preach, but only you will know what feeling you have. It is like the feeling of being killed. That fugitive smuggler also ate, dressed, slept, and even took a bath, but only he knew how unbearable that kind of life was. He had committed many evil things before, yet he never felt so bad as he did now. This time he felt truly bad, because he had touched authority.</P><P>The principle is the same in spiritual things. If the reality of the church and the presence of the Lord are truly among us, authority will definitely be present. If you ask me what this authority is, I cannot tell you. It is just like a nation; as long as there is a government, there is authority. Sooner or later you will touch the matter of authority. Once you offend the authority, you will not be able to live a normal life before God. You can still pray, read the Word, and serve the Lord, but the taste within will not be the same; in no way will you have peace any longer.</P><P>Oh, brothers, there is something in the church and among God's people that is called authority. Sooner or later you will confront this thing. Never think that it is a certain person who has become your authority. You may say that an officer has become your authority in a nation. Strictly speaking, however, this is not true either, because officers can change, but the authority still remains. It is difficult to explain what is meant by touching authority. This is not a mere knowledge of a common truth. If we follow the Lord faithfully and if we really want to walk in the way of the Lord, sooner or later we will encounter something called authority in the Lord's house and in His kingdom. If you do not wish to be confronted with this matter, it is best for you to take the way of Catholicism or to be a nominal member in Protestantism. In such a case you will never touch authority, because there is no such thing and no such understanding in those places. Forgive me for saying this, for I was a member of a denominational church for quite a long time. I know quite well what goes on in a denomination. There you will never encounter such a thing as authority. But soon after I took this way, I touched something that I could never offend, something that, if I tried to offend it, would cause me to find myself unable to live before God. To be unable to live does not mean that I would die. It means that I would be like that smuggler&#151;I could still eat and dress myself, but my life would become unbearable.</P><P>Brothers, let me say a serious word: if the church in your locality cannot cause others to encounter authority, I can say absolutely that it is not a church. If that church is truly established by God, surely you will meet such a thing called authority. I have heard people contending: "Are you saying that you are the church and others are not?" Brothers, there is no need to contend; you can try it yourselves. When you go to some places, you will not encounter authority, whereas in other places you will encounter it. You will touch something. You may not be able to explain it, but gradually you will understand that it is a matter of authority. It is something that you cannot afford to offend. If you submit to it, you will live, and you will have peace, blessing, and God's presence. However, if you oppose it, offend it, and rebel against it, you may still be able to pray, to read the Bible, and to be a Christian, but yet you yourself know what kind of taste there is within you. You have touched something. This is what we mean by knowing authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. SUBMITTING TO AUTHORITY</H2><P>Once a person encounters authority, he cannot help but submit to authority. It is useless to have a thousand arguments that are right. Only through submission can one have life. Only through submission can one live. Only through submission can there be blessing, and only through submission is there a way to go on. Keep in mind that we are not speaking about the matter of obedience, but submission. I have seen some children who acted according to their parents' desire, yet they were not at all submissive. They did what their parents said, but there was no inward submission. I have also seen the opposite: some children are not at all acting according to their parents' desire, yet they are full of submission. In some cases, you may have conflict with authority and may find that you cannot obey, but your spirit is still one of submission, as is your attitude. In still other cases, you may be acting in obedience to authority, yet in reality there is no submission. What we are talking about here is not the question of obedience, but the question of submission. That which we obey may not be the authority. Only that which we submit to is the authority.</P><P>Do not have the misconception that submission to authority means that you are obligated to do even things that are wrong; this is not true! Even when you find the authority proposing something that is wrong, you can still submit, without doing the thing that is wrong. It is not a question of obedience, but altogether a question of submission. Every elder must be aware of this fact; he must be full of a spirit of submission. Only then will a spirit of submission prevail throughout the whole church. If the whole church lacks a spirit of submission, the elders are responsible for this lack. An unsubmissive person will only bring forth an unsubmissive church; he will never be able to bring forth a submissive church. Some may say that the Lord is our only Head. This is right. Nevertheless, you and I must learn to touch something called authority and to submit to this authority. Only then can we bring into the church an atmosphere and a spirit of submission, and only then will the church have a way to go on. Otherwise, there will be no way to go on: You can boast about your ability or capability, but be prepared that one day the whole church will have an unsubmissive spirit towards you. Only those who are submissive can bring forth the spirit of submission, and only they can bring forth a submissive church.</P><P>To obey is one thing, and to submit is another. Praise God, throughout the Bible these two terms are used in our relationship to God. We need to submit to God and to obey Him as well. The Bible does not say that the wife should obey the husband. If the Bible told the wife to obey the husband, that would be terrible. Some husbands demand that their wives worship idols with them. Should the wives obey? Of course not! The Bible only charges us to submit to those who are in authority; it never requires us to obey them. If God had charged us to obey those in authority, that would be terrible. King Nebuchadnezzar commanded Daniel's three friends to worship the image. If they were to obey him, that would have been terrible. God says to submit, yet they could not worship the image, nor could they obey the king's command. At the same time, they should still submit to the authority. Here was an authority which they had to come under.</P><P>In overseeing a church, the elders must first touch something called authority. Authority represents God. In the church there is such a thing as God's delegated authority. Once you try to annul it, there will be no administration of the church, and there will be no reality of the church. There are many denominations today. They all call themselves churches, but can you see the reality of the church there? Rarely do you see it. Why is this so? It is because you do not see authority among them. If you go to a group of Christians and you do not touch authority there, you have to put a big question mark on that place. Wherever a place has authority, you can say that surely the church is there. It may not be the entire church, but at least it is a representation of the church.</P><P>I have absolute boldness to speak what I am speaking of here, because I have found out these things from experience. We experienced this matter when we were first raised up to meet in North China. Regardless to which meeting you went, you could sense something that you could not oppose. Once you opposed it, you would have trouble with God. Once you opposed it, you would not be able to pray any longer. Once you opposed it, you could not go on as a proper Christian any longer, nor could you go on in life, nor could you go on to serve. There was no other way than for you to submit yourself to this thing. I could not tell you what this thing was before, but now I know that it was the representation of God's presence. In other words, it was the authority.</P><P>Not everything that a delegated authority of God says is right. From my experience I can tell you that there are often many mistakes. But from our side, we can only refuse to obey; we cannot refuse to submit. Once we refuse to submit, it is as if we are throwing away our own life. In some things the delegated authority may not perceive as clearly as you do, and his judgments and decisions may not be accurate. You can only refuse to obey; if you do not obey, it will not cost you your life. I believe you understand what I mean by costing your life. It means that you cannot go on before God. However, the minute you refuse to submit, you know that you have immediately sacrificed your life. You will get into problems with your spiritual life, with your service, and with your fellowship, a fellowship not only with God, but with the brothers and sisters. An elder must touch authority, and all the brothers must also submit to authority.</P><P>Never presume authority to be a matter of a person, a few persons, or a group of persons. Not at all. Suppose here is the chief executive of a government department. He is of course an authority, but if you understand authority to be this person alone, you are wrong. On the one hand, the chief executive of a government is an authority. But on the other hand, when the office of chief executive is changed to another person, the authority still remains there, because what we have is a nation and a government. In the same principle, what we have here is the church. It is the place of God's administration on earth. God commits His presence and establishes His deputy here. As such, even when the person is changed, God's presence and His deputy authority still remain.</P><P>Down through the years, the matter of authority has caused me to realize that there is God and there is a sovereign One in the universe. If what we are serving is merely a name or some doctrinal terms, there will not be the reality of authority among us. But because the God whom we serve is real and living, the matter of authority is here among us. The Gentiles can advocate democracy or a congressional system, but in the church none of this kind of thing will work. The Gentiles are without God, and they are merely a community of people. With the church, however, there is the question of God's presence, God's move, and God's operation. For this reason, democracy cannot be applied to the church. Moreover, neither can autocracy be applied, for autocracy centers around a single individual. With the church, it is not a question of many or one. With the church, it is a question of God's presence and its representation. If this representation is with two or three, then it is a matter of these two or three. If this representation is with ten persons, then it is a matter of these ten persons. If this representation is with one individual, then it is a matter of this individual. The representation of God's presence is God's authority in that place. One cannot oppose this; he has to submit himself to this. For this reason, the elders have to learn to be those who submit to authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. ON BEING THE AUTHORITY</H2><P>In the church not only is there the question of submission to authority, but there is also the question of being the authority. To submit to authority means that others have the authority and you submit to it. To be an authority means that authority is with you and you should act as the authority. On one hand, the elders should submit to authority; on the other, they are also the authority. Strictly speaking, this principle applies not only to the church, but to all representative authorities among human communities. On the one hand, there is the submission to authority, and on the other hand there is the exercise of authority.</P><P>In some local churches, the elders were born humble. They are influenced by the modern age and are quite democratic. They never know what authority is. You can predict that the churches under their hands will never be strong. In order for a local church to be strong, there must be some submitting-to-authority brothers who act as the authority. They will neither try to nullify everyone's feeling, nor will they allow everyone to say what they will. In some churches, you do not touch any authority; what you touch is only arguments and much opinion. The reason for this is that, on the one hand, their elders failed to learn the lesson of submission to authority, and on the other hand, much less have the elders themselves learned to be the authority.</P><P>In some local churches, I have met some elders who, because of their unwillingness to submit to authority, have purposely made things a little more democratic. I believe you understand what I mean. Such ones want to condemn the authority that they are supposed to submit to; they do not want any authority. As a result, they do not want to be the authority themselves, and everything becomes democratic. However, I want to tell the brothers and sisters that this kind of action betrays the church and sacrifices it. In order to justify their refusal to submit to authority, they try not to be the authority themselves. Whatever things happen, they just go along with what the brothers and sisters deem best. The meaning of this, to put it in a blunt way, is simply: "I don't mind other people's business, so don't mind my business. I will not be anyone's authority, and I will not submit to anyone else's authority." Brothers and sisters, this is something from Babel. It is something that comes from the spirit of Babel. The church in such a place should be called Babylon, because there is confusion, and the tongues have been confounded, and those in it do not speak the same language any longer. To have many languages and to have the tongues confounded is a sign of punishment from God. It shows that there is no authority. It was not a good sign to have no king in Israel and to have every man doing that which was right in his own eyes.</P><P>Brothers, whenever you propose democracy or autocracy in the church, you are denying God's authority. In the church there is no democracy, and there is likewise no autocracy. In the church, there should only be God's presence and God's delegated authority. The elders need to learn to touch authority, to submit to authority, and to be the authority. The church is not a place where people express their opinion or where they debate. It is a place where God is feared, His lordship is honored, and His presence rests and is represented. Only when such is found is there the church.</P><P>To repeat, in the church, there is God's presence, and the representation of this presence. This representation is the authority. If you submit to it and allow it to manifest itself upon you, you will eventually become the authority. If you are an elder in a local church, but you can never be an authority, you have to realize that you have utterly failed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. NOT EXERCISING AUTHORITY</H2><P>Since an elder is the authority, how should he exercise authority? Please remember that the way to exercise authority is to not exercise authority. If the elders in the church have the attitude that they are the elders, that they have the authority, and that they are here to exercise their authority, that would be one of the ugliest things there is! We see an amazing thing in the attitude of Moses in Numbers. He was indeed an authority, but look at how he exercised his authority. On the one hand, he was being the authority. On the other hand, he was not exercising authority. The exercise of authority that I am talking about is one that neither refrains from the use of authority nor exercises authority. This is indeed wonderful. Moses was a person who was always the authority among the Israelites, yet he never exercised his authority. His not exercising his authority was his exercise of authority. I believe you understand what I mean. Everyone who exercises authority to claim that he is an elder, that he has the authority to deal with such-and-such a matter, and that he will exercise this authority, is using his authority in the wrong way! A person can only be an authority; he can never exercise authority. If you can be an authority without exercising authority, this is the genuine exercise of authority. This is what I mean by the exercise of authority.</P><P>You can find out from reading the Scriptures that Moses as a leader differs from all the other leaders of the world. Today, every leader of every nation exercises his authority, but Moses did not exercise his authority. Nevertheless, Moses never let go of anything; he was always there as the authority. After he descended from Mt. Sinai and saw the Israelites dancing and worshipping the golden calf, he did not call a committee meeting. Had he done that, probably ninety percent of the people would have agreed to worship the golden calf. Moses did not give them the chance to discuss anything. He told them to take away the calf, and he ground it to powder and scattered it upon the water for the children of Israel to drink. This was not his exercising of his authority; it was him being there as the authority. In the whole record of Moses, you can see that he never exercised his authority. He was the authority, yet he never exercised authority. In actuality, he was exercising his authority in this way.</P><P>It is a regrettable thing as well as a shameful one that in some local churches there are elders who are apparently not the authority. Yet in reality they exercise authority very much. Outwardly they act very democratic, yet in fact they hold the authority in their own hands. This is a very shameful thing. If you and I are to be the elders and are to oversee the church, we have to learn on the one hand to submit to authority, and on the other hand to be God's delegated authority. At the same time, we should not exercise authority. You should not say that since you are an elder, what you say has to count and what you decide must be done. If you do not exercise your authority, you are in reality being the authority there. This seems to be a contradicting word. How can someone be an authority without exercising authority? And how can a person not exercise his authority while at the same time he is the authority? Nevertheless, I believe the brothers and sisters know what this means in their practical experience. There is nothing contradicting about it. If you are not clear about this matter, consider the story of Moses again. He was a delegated authority. He submitted to authority, and he was acting also as the authority. However, many times when difficulty came, he submitted to God, and he did not exercise his authority. His not exercising the authority was his most dignified way of exercising authority. It is only when one submits to the authority in the church, and only when he is being an authority as well, that he can apply his authority by refraining from exercising authority. I believe that the brothers and sisters understand what I mean. This is the proper condition of an elder.</P><P>May the Lord have mercy upon us and open our eyes to see that without authority, there will be no administration, and without administration, there will be no church. May we receive His mercy to meet sooner or later such a representation of His presence in the church. This representation is the authority. Once we touch authority, we will have to learn to submit to authority and to learn to represent Him as the authority. At the same time, we should be like Moses, not exercising authority. In the end, this will itself be the proper exercise of authority.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HOW TO BE AN AUTHORITY</H1><P>We have considered briefly in the last chapter the knowledge concerning authority. We mentioned something concerning the matter of being the authority and of exercising authority. Strictly speaking, the exercise of authority is part of the work of being the authority. If an elder knows how to be an authority, surely he will know how to exercise authority. For this reason, in this chapter we will deal specifically with the question of being an authority. To know authority is for the purpose of being an authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IN LOVE</H2><P>Ephesians 5 mentions the matter of the husband as the authority. There it points out specifically that the husband is an authority. The way this matter is presented is quite unusual. It says that the wives have to submit to their husbands. We know that the other side of submission is domination, yet God never charges the husbands to dominate over their wives. He only charges them to love their wives. The husband is an authority; he is the head. But how should the husband behave as the head? How should he behave as the authority? Ephesians 5 clearly tells us that the way is in love.</P><P>Ephesians 6 also mentions that the parents are an authority, especially the father. But there it also says that the parents should not provoke their children to anger. Once again this is a question of love. Therefore, we can see that the husbands have to love their wives, and the fathers must not provoke their children to anger. The husband is the delegated authority to the wife, and the father is the delegated authority to the children. Yet each of the delegated authorities can only function in love and in the way of not provoking to anger.</P><P>We can see one thing clearly here: God appoints us to be the authority, yet He does not want us to take the way of discipline. In a family, if the parents lack love toward their children, but apply strict discipline only, surely the result will not be good. Good parents do discipline their children, but the way of discipline is absolutely in love. The children do not feel that the parents are controlling them. On the contrary, they feel that the parents love them, care for them, are concerned for them, and are mindful of them. They feel that the parents are making plans and arrangements for them. Within this loving care is the controlling and the authority. The same is true with husbands in relation to their wives.</P><P>There was a brother who heard a message that wives should submit to the husband's authority and that husbands should be the head. He felt that he had not been the head before, and that from that day on, he had to go home and be the head. He went home in a serious manner, with great pomp and a stern face, and assumed to be the head. Actually, you do not become the head by putting on a front or by assuming a stern face. Neither do you do so by presuming that you are something. To be the head in this way is absolutely wrong.</P><P>In some local churches, I have seen brothers who act as elders by putting on a front. They say, "Oh, I am an elder!" They assume an elder's bearing and speak with an elder's tone. I must tell you that there is nothing more ugly in the church than to see such a thing. Please remember that the amount of love a person has is the amount of authority he possesses. A person can only exercise authority over those he loves. Without love, there will be no basis for authority. Do not expect that you can exercise authority over those whom you do not love. There is no such thing. Why is it that often a stepmother has no position to exercise authority over her children? And why is it that even when she exercises authority, the children may not accept it? The reason is that there is no maternal love. Maternal love is the basis for a mother to exercise her authority over her children. Without love there is no ground for exercising authority. Therefore, we must see that the degree of love there is in a person is the degree of authority he can exercise. Love is the basis of authority and the power behind it.</P><P>It never works for an elder to try to assume authority in the church by force. Not only will this not be pleasing in the eyes of men, but it will have no confirmation from the Holy Spirit. You can assume your authority, but the Holy Spirit will not be there. You can only be an authority on one basis, and that is in love. If you genuinely love the brothers and sisters, the love itself will become the control, and it will become your authority over others. Whether toward the whole church, or toward a few brothers and sisters, you must remember that if you do not have any love, you must never exercise your authority, and you must never try to be involved in the affairs of others. If you try to be involved in their business, you are controlling, and you are assuming authority. If you want to be involved in the affairs of others, and if you want to control and to be the authority, you must first spread out your love as a ground for you to step on. If you do not have love as the basis of authority, you will not have the ground for you to step on, and it will not work for you to try to be the authority. You can tell the Lord, "Lord, I cannot do anything, because I do not have a foundation stone; I cannot build upon anything. There is no stepping stone beneath me; I have nowhere to put my foot." I hope that the elders would clearly realize where they themselves are in this matter. Towards the church, towards an individual, or towards a group, if you have never exercised love and have never laid a groundwork of love, you might as well forget about being involved in their affairs, for if you do, you do not have an adequate realization concerning yourself. Strictly speaking, to be an authority, as we put it, is simply love. You have to love the church, to love the brothers and sisters. This love will then become your authority.</P><P>Suppose someone is in trouble and you are asked to help. If you do not have a love for him, you cannot solve the problem. It is actually not your purpose to solve his problems, but to love him, to be concerned for him, and to bear his burden. Not only should you bear the matter as a burden, but you should bear the person as a burden. Only when you have this frame of mind will you be able to solve the problem and bring the brother through. If this is lacking, even if the brother has a broken skull and his face is bleeding, I would advise the elders to stay at home and sleep, and not try to take care of the situation. I believe you understand what I mean. This way of meddling is useless; it is a vain exercise of authority. It is to be an authority with no basis whatsoever, and it is equivalent to being a busybody. It is true that you are an elder in the church, but what you do will not work, because there is no love. An authority can only function in love. In other words, love is authority transformed. The love you exercise toward the brothers and sisters is the authority. Without this love, it will not work to try to be an authority.</P><P>The Lord said that the elders in the church are likened to shepherds of the flock. You can understand what this means by watching a shepherd: while he rules over the sheep, he is loving his sheep with a fervent love. The food, the water to drink, the resting place, and the protection for the sheep are all prepared by the shepherd. With him there is the outflow of love. As a result, the sheep hear his voice.</P><P>I was once in Scotland. There was a big ranch there with a number of sheep. The shepherd had a few special dogs that were small and short, with short legs, and he used them to protect his sheep. When the shepherd led the flock to the meadows, sometimes the sheep would move in a scattered way and would go astray. The shepherd wanted them to stay in the meadows, but they would run away to the creeks. In order to gather them back to the flock, the shepherd would give a certain signal to the dogs. Immediately, the dogs would run out. They could run faster than the sheep. Although the sheep were large and the dogs were small, the dogs were very fierce, and the sheep had to turn back to the flock. Once I saw two or three sheep running away from the flock, and the shepherd was helpless. If he were to chase after one, the others would have run away. And if he were to chase after another, still others would have run away. The shepherd gave a command, and one of the dogs obediently ran in front of the sheep and barked fiercely at the sheep. The amazing thing was that though the dog was fierce, it never hurt the sheep. In this way, the sheep all turned back, and within a short time, the dogs had rounded up all the sheep that had strayed and brought them back. The expression of the dogs seemed very fierce, but yet you would feel that they were full of affection. When the sheep came back, the shepherd was also full of tenderness. I thought that this was very meaningful. Even the ferocity shown to the sheep was an expression of love. This is the discipline of love, and it is absolutely an expression of love.</P><P>Often children are very perceptive. Some parents punish their children very severely, but the more they punish them, the more the children are drawn to them, because they know that the parents love them. However, if someone does not have love, the children can also feel the lack. Some parents can speak very harsh words, words which others would consider extremely serious, yet the children can taste the love in those harsh words. Sometimes a guest may say some pleasant and sweet words to a child, but the child knows that the words have nothing to do with him. Even a one-year-old or a two-year-old can sense this. Hence, the elders should realize that, while there is the need of proper authority in the management of the church, and without it there cannot be a proper management of the church, yet in being the authority, the elders must turn their authority into love. It should appear to others that authority is completely gone, and that everything is love. Love is authority transformed, in much the same way that the body of the Lord Jesus was God transformed. He never caused others to feel that He was God. On the contrary, He caused others to feel that He was fully a man. In the same principle, those who are the authority should not cause others to feel that they are the authority. On the contrary, they should cause others to feel that everything is absolutely a matter of love. If the brothers and sisters cannot sense love in you, you have no position, no ground, and no standing to be an authority. To be an authority, one must have love.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN SPIRIT</H2><P>To be an authority, one must not only be in love, but must be in spirit as well. We all know what it is to be in spirit. You cannot say that you are an elder, and that you are an authority in the church, and therefore you will assume your authority and will deal with matters and manage things your way. You cannot do this. We must learn to live in the spirit. The judgment and handling of every matter must be carried out in spirit. Although you may be an elder, you cannot act unless there is the moving, the prompting, and the burden in your spirit. You cannot be an elder in position only; you must learn to be an elder in spirit. Whether or not a matter should be handled by you, whether or not you should say something, and whether or not you should go to a brother and have some fellowship with him, these matters should not be determined by your position as an elder. You cannot say that something is within the jurisdiction of the elders, that the elders should take charge of the matter, and that it is therefore right for you to deal with it. This is wrong. We must learn to live in the spirit. You can say that this is a matter of leading, or a matter of burden, but I would say that this is to be in spirit.</P><P>When you hear that a brother is involved in trouble, you should bear his burden and should go before the Lord to touch His feeling and to inquire in spirit as to what you should do. Should you leave the matter as it is, should you take up the case, or should you deal with it together with the other elders? You must sense the feeling of the spirit and act according to this feeling.</P><P>Nothing else requires a person to be in the spirit more than being an elder. Unfortunately, I have met many elders in many localities who are willing to check if they are in spirit in their daily lives, but who neglect the matter of being in spirit when confronted with matters related to the management of church affairs, because they think that these are their rightful duties and that they should take charge of them. For this reason, in the handling of these matters, many times others do not sense the anointing and do not touch the supply of life.</P><P>I hope that all the elders would see that every time they handle things, even if the things are within their jurisdiction, they have to turn back to their spirit. If you need to say a few words of rebuke, you should do so in spirit. If you need to speak a few words of comfort, you also need to be in spirit. If you need to speak a few words of praise, you need to be in spirit. In handling all the affairs of the church, you have to turn to your spirit. If there is no sense in the spirit and no move in the spirit, it would be better for you to drop the matter. Brothers, this is not a doctrine. In order for the church that you are overseeing to be in life and with anointing, every arrangement you make in the church must be made in the spirit.</P><P>In addition, the elders' meetings should be conducted in spirit. Many times, the elders' meetings have become habitual gatherings week after week. Because of their involvement in the discussion of affairs, these elders have neglected living in the spirit. As a result, the meetings become dead and dry, and there is no freshness or anointing in them.</P><P>To be in spirit is to be in God's presence. It is to allow God to rule within us. Once we are in spirit, there is no need to be an authority any longer; we become an authority automatically. Where there is God's presence, there is authority. Never forget that authority is simply God Himself. Without God's presence, we will lose this authority. Hence, all the time we have to learn to live in the spirit, to touch the sense of the spirit, to act in the spirit, and to speak in the spirit.</P><P>We have mentioned before that we have to be in love and that love is authority transformed. Now we are saying that we have to be in spirit and that life is authority transformed. When you learn to touch the affairs of the church in spirit and to handle the affairs of the church in spirit, you will impart to others a sense of life. Once you touch something, you handle something, others will feel that there is life. Once you stand up to speak or make an announcement, others will feel that there is life. Once you explain something or make some arrangements, others will also feel that there is life. This is because you are doing everything in spirit. Life is authority transformed. When there is life with a person, authority is surely with him also. When life comes to an individual, or a group, or an environment, authority is there also. Life is authority transformed.</P><P>For this reason, the elders need to learn to be the authority, and they need to learn to live in the spirit. Not only do they need to be in spirit in their daily life, but in all the managing, moves, words, expressions, and even attitudes in the church, they have to be in spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. IN RESURRECTION</H2><P>To be in resurrection means that all of our actions have to pass through the cross. Suppose you need to announce something to the brothers and sisters; you must first put this matter to the death of the cross, to test it and to filter it. Many times, after such filtering, there may be nothing left to say. Originally, you may be one who would say whatever there is to say. This is to be in the natural realm. It is not in resurrection. Now when you filter what you are going to say, along with all your thoughts, intentions, motives, and goals, through the death of the cross, you are filtering out everything natural. Only that which is left after the testing of the cross can be presented. If you do this, you are speaking in resurrection.</P><P>For example, two brothers from the same district may be having an argument. You are one of the elders there, and you feel that you should go to visit the two of them. But you cannot go so quickly. You have to ask yourself if the thought of visiting the brothers is in the natural realm or in resurrection. You have to put the matter through the death of the cross to test it; you have to allow the death of the cross to filter it. Many times, after such filtering, not much is left. Although you are aware of the fact that the two are arguing, there is nothing in you that is in resurrection, and as a result you cannot go to see them.</P><P>Many times we feel that there are people we need to visit, things we have to say, matters we have to take care of, and opinions we have to express. But after the test of the cross, these things are all gone; there is no more need to see the person, to say the words, to deal with the matters, or to express the opinions. We feel that there is no more need to do all these things because they are all seen as being natural. Sometimes we will find out that they are not merely natural, but fleshly as well. They are our own inclinations and preferences. None of these can pass the test of the cross. Once these things meet the cross, they are through. When the world says that a person has to think twice before he acts, it means that he has to consider the pros and cons, and to consider if the matter is suitable or not. Such is not the case with us here. Every time you need to do something in the church, to express some attitude, or to voice some opinion, you have to take the principle of the cross. You must first place these things in the death of the cross and test them to see if they can stand the cross.</P><P>Even in giving a message, you need to be tested by the cross. Some messages are through once they are tested by the cross. You may discover that your messages are something entirely of another realm; they are natural, fleshly, and even fleshy. They are things east of the river Jordan, and they are not in resurrection. Hence, for those things that we are not sure whether they have passed through the cross, it is better for us not to do them. Anything we do or say must pass through the test of the cross. Only those things that have passed through the cross are in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. IN PATIENCE</H2><P>Patience is something that it is very difficult to talk about. I believe all of us know what patience is. But allow me to say this&#151;nine out of ten people who think they are patient understand patience in an incorrect way. The patience that most people understand has to do with being slow and not being in a hurry. Patience to them is to do nothing when others offend you. If someone promises to come at twelve  o'clock, and he has not come at 12:15, I exercise patience towards him. This is what most people understand patience to be, but this is not the patience we are speaking of here. The patience we are speaking of refers to having hope in others despite encountering many troubles. No matter how much work you have invested in others, and no matter how terrible the result is, you still have hope in them. No matter how much you have worked, and despite a lack of results after repeated labor, you are still not disappointed. A person looks hopeless today and tomorrow. He looks hopeless after a year or two years, but you still go to him. This is what we mean by patience.</P><P>I have met a brother who in some aspects is a typical patient man, but who in other aspects is a typical impatient man. On the one hand, this person is never in a hurry; he speaks slowly, acts slowly, and contacts people slowly. He is indeed a patient man. On the other hand, however, he does not have any patience. When he gives a message, he finishes it in three to five sentences. When he deals with the affairs of the church, whatever he can accomplish he accomplishes, and whatever he cannot accomplish he simply lets go. You may say that he is a very forthright person, but actually he is simply an impatient person. What is patience? It is not patience to do things slowly. It is not patience to wait. Patience is to be able to endure setbacks in your work. When you are repeatedly mistreated, yet you still hold on, this is patience.</P><P>There was a co-worker in Tsingtao who had really learned the lesson of patience. In 1934 he was led to work in Tsingtao. After staying there for half a year, there was no result. After one year, he still saw no result. In July and August of 1935, when Brother Nee went with a few of us brothers from Tsinan to Tsingtao, we saw that the condition there was completely barren; there was absolutely no result. All of us had the feeling that perhaps this brother should not remain in Tsingtao. It was too much a suffering for him to remain there all the time without seeing any result. At that time his circumstances were difficult. He rented a small room underneath the stairway of someone else's house. There was only an old bed and an old chair. Nothing looked proper, and there were absolutely no results in his work. Everyone would tell him to go to another place. Yet he continued to stand fast there.</P><P>He persevered under this kind of condition for another three years. By that time there was some upturn in the work. The saints there found a house to meet in on the top of a hill. Everyone going to the meeting had to climb up the hill. I was only a little over thirty years of age at that time, but even I complained and said, "Are you going to ask people to climb a hill to come to the meeting?" That was all the result there was of three years of labor. I thought there were so many places that he could work. Why did he have to stay in Tsingtao? But he was still working enthusiastically there and was not discouraged at all.</P><P>Another two years passed, and their meeting was moved from the hilltop back to the plain. Geographically speaking, it went down, but spiritually speaking, it rose up. Thank the Lord that from that point on, the work in Tsingtao had a little beginning. By the spring of 1942, they had over one hundred thirty meeting already. After two months of meeting and a few baptism meetings, they added two hundred more. By the end of that year, the number became six to seven hundred. By then, the work really opened up. Our brother did not have any special gift, but he learned the lesson of patience. He stood there, and his standing caused him to gain a result. This is the patience I am talking about.</P><P>Please remember that in order to oversee the church there is the need to exercise authority, and there is the need to be the authority. But there is also the need to learn a serious lesson, that is, to abide in patience. Only when you abide in patience can you never lose hope in the church or in the brothers and sisters. Even if the brothers and sisters become worse than they are now, and even if they do not seem to have any turn, we should still visit them and should still pray for them and care for them. No matter what their condition is, we will not lose hope. We continue to have such a heart towards them. This hope is the authority. Theoretically speaking, you cannot say that this is authority. But practically speaking, this kind of patience is definitely authority transformed.</P><P>For example, it may be that I help a district meeting for three months, but there is still no improvement. However, I am not disappointed. This does not mean that I am unconcerned. I am indeed very concerned in my heart. When I pray before God, I would shed my tears, but I am not disappointed. After half a year, there is still no improvement, but still I am not disappointed. A sister who serves in the business office may not even be able to write a letter of recommendation, and it may be fruitless for me to teach her to do so. Yet I am not disappointed; I continue to teach her. This is what I mean by patience. A brother cannot clean the windows properly, but you still charge him to clean them, because you have the patience to withstand this incompetent cleaning. On the one hand, you charge him to do it. On the other hand, you bear with him. What does it mean to be impatient? To be impatient is to have an attitude that a person should clean only if he does a good job, and if he does not do a good job, he should not clean. What is patience? Patience is to say that although someone may be incompetent in the way he cleans, still you ask him to come to clean. Not only will you not send this one away, but you will keep him even if he wants to leave of his own accord.</P><P>I definitely know that the elders in many places are politicians. They never have any patience. For example, a brother may have been serving as a deacon for two months, and he is found to be unsuitable. What should be done? It so happens that this brother becomes sick and has to take a leave of absence. The elders may say, "Since he cannot come, we will not force him to come any longer." This is to be political. The elders do not want this brother to come anyway, but they are too polite to ask him not to come. If you have learned the lesson of patience, you will not do this. You will say to this brother, "Brother, you are sick, and we will pray for you. Come back to serve after you are well. It is true that we are not satisfied with what you have done in the past two months, but we encourage you to come again." If you visit him, you pray with him, and you tell him not to be discouraged to serve again, and when he is well, you teach him again, you lead him on, and you have patience with him time after time, by the second or third year, he will have learned. You have to know that by that day, he will have come under much authority. Your patience has perfected this man. In the end, this patience becomes the authority. After two months of observation you may judge him unqualified and may try to get rid of him through some political maneuvering. But in the end whatever is hidden within will be manifested without. When others detect the political flavor in you, they will not be able to submit to you, and your authority is finished. Hence, we have to be an authority in patience.</P><P>It is right that elders in the church should not lightly choose brothers and sisters to take up responsibilities or to coordinate with them. But once you have invited someone to bear a responsibility or have invited someone to coordinate with you, you have to be patient. Even when there are failures and mistakes, you should still be patient. You have to be unceasingly patient. The elders must serve as the authority in patience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. WITH DISCERNMENT</H2><P>An elder must also have the power of discernment. He cannot deal with matters and make judgments and decisions foolishly. He has to learn to be an authority with discernment. We will speak about this point specifically in the next chapter. Here we will just mention this in passing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. IN COORDINATION</H2><P>An elder must also serve as the authority in coordination. Whenever he is isolated, he is no longer the authority. Concerning the coordination of the elders, we will also have a special section to cover this matter. The eldership is a corporate body. It can be compared to the government in a nation. No one there can be isolated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. ON BEING THE AUTHORITY<br>AND ON EXERCISING AUTHORITY</H2><P>An elder must be the authority, but he must never exercise authority. Whenever you exercise your authority as an elder, you are already disqualified from being an elder. Let me again relate the story of Moses. Moses was indeed the authority among God's people, yet he never exercised authority. Every time that problems, difficulties, or business affairs arose, he had only one place to go, which was to bow before God. No one ever heard him say that he was God's established authority, or that he was going to deal with matters or take care of affairs with authority. He never said anything like this. But yet all the while, he was being the authority there. He was acting as an authority in love, in patience, and with discernment. His being the authority in this way was his exercising of his authority.</P><P>In the same way, you and I must learn to be the authority in love, in spirit, in resurrection, in patience, in discernment, and in coordination. At the same time, we must not exercise our authority. Always bear in mind that we should never exercise our authority as an elder. Never say, "I am an elder, and I sit in the seat of an elder. I am doing such-and-such a thing in the position of an elder." This is wrong. May the title of an elder and the position of an elder be reduced to zero among us. Among us we should only have the person, the ministry, the responsibility, and the burden of an elder. For the elders, to be an authority is to exercise authority.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DISCERNMENT OF THE ELDERS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. DISCERNMENT AND MANAGEMENT</H2><P>An elder's ability of discernment is definitely related to the management of the church. An elder who has no discernment concerning people and things will surely be unable to manage a church. In other words, a person who is muddled cannot manage the church. The person who manages and oversees must be considerably clear in his mind. If you take three as four or four as three, you cannot manage the church. Even if you were to manage it, your management would be a management of confusion. Therefore, either we do not mention church management at all, or if we do, we need to see a basic need, which is the ability of discernment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SPHERE OF DISCERNMENT</H2><P>An elder's sphere of discernment differs from that of the people of the world. Their sphere of discernment is worldly and materialistic, but the elders' sphere of discernment is spiritual. This is an important principle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Discerning Spirituality</H2><P>In discerning people and things, the first thing the elders have to determine is whether or not the person or the matter is spiritual. For instance, a brother may suggest something to you as an elder. First, your job is not to discern if the matter is right or wrong, good or bad, but whether or not it is spiritual. The church is not a social organization or a business institution. The church is a spiritual family and a spiritual garden. Business affairs are there only to render some support. The goal of church administration is to nourish and supply every family member with life, so that each one will grow to maturity. Or to put it in another way, this goal is to render every tree in this garden the adequate nourishment and watering, so that each one will grow up. Therefore, everything in the church must be discerned with spiritual insight. Even if some brothers come with suggestions to buy land for a meeting hall, or to build a meeting hall a certain kind of way, the elders must have spiritual discernment. Some brothers may suggest, "We want to send out a notice or an invitation." The elders should first discern if this way of doing things is spiritual. This is a very serious principle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Discerning Death and Resurrection</H2><P>An elder must also be able to discern whether a brother or sister has passed through the death of the cross and whether he or she is a person living in resurrection. Perhaps certain ones are still in the natural realm, because the things they say come from their natural and ethical concepts. Perhaps within them there is still the flesh, indignation, and some other things. Perhaps within them there is still insincerity and ambition. Whenever you contact people, pick up a conversation, or encounter a certain matter, you must have this ability to discern. You should not only discern whether a person fears God, but also if he has passed through the death of the cross and is in resurrection in everything, in every point, in every conversation, and in every proposal. An elder should have such an ability to discern.</P><P>It may be the same opinion and the same suggestion, but when it comes from one who has passed through death and resurrection, the Holy Spirit within you will give a certain response or a certain echo. On the contrary, if it is suggested by one who has not passed through the death of the cross, who is not living in resurrection, but is living in the natural realm, in his ethical concept, or if it is suggested by a fleshly, indignant, insincere person, or one with other motives, the Holy Spirit will give you another reaction within. This is a great factor in the elders' administration of the church.</P><P>A brother may say to an elder, "I feel that next week we should preach the gospel." If that elder has spiritual discernment, he might not accept the suggestion. This does not mean that it is wrong to preach the gospel, but the elder touches something impure in this one who suggests this matter. Perhaps the elder can take the same suggestion from another person, because this one has passed through the cross and is in resurrection; his spirit is pure, and there is no mixture within him. Only through such discernment by the elders can the service in the church be so pure and so free from the natural realm, the human concepts, the human inclinations, and the human ideas, and be in resurrection.</P><P>For example, some brother may say: "Brother, now is the best time to preach the gospel. I received the news today that in ten days a certain denomination will conduct an evangelistic campaign. We should seize the opportunity first. We should not let others seize the initiative." Let me ask the brothers and sisters, Is this thought good? Indeed, it is not good. Although what this brother tells you is a good thing and his motive is good, you can sense that this brother has not been dealt with by the cross; he is still in his natural person, and he is still competing with others. Gospel preaching is a good thing, but in this matter, you can touch that this man has never been crucified by the cross.</P><P>Therefore, in any matter which brothers or sisters suggest to us, although they may be good and may be for the church, the elders must discern if the persons have passed through the cross and if they are in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Discerning the Purity<br>of the Spirit and the Heart</H2><P>An elder must also be able to discern if a person's spirit is pure and if his heart is proper. When someone tells you that another is right or wrong, you should not immediately accept this word. Whether or not you should take the word does not depend on whether the words are good or bad, right or wrong. Rather, it depends on the speaker, whether or not his spirit is pure, and whether or not his heart is proper. Sometimes what a person speaks are good words and words of praise concerning the brothers and sisters. Yet behind the praises, you can touch an impure spirit and an improper motive. On the contrary, it is possible that a brother may come to the elders and relate to them the shortcomings of a responsible brother or the mistakes of a serving sister. However, you can touch that his spirit is pure and his motive single. He may be talking about the wrongs of others all the time, but his spirit is pure, and his motive is single. Hence, the elders must not only discern if this is a criticism of the brothers and sisters or a praise of them and if this is about the brothers' and sisters' right or about their wrong. It does not mean that you can take it if it is right and reject it if it is wrong. Instead, you must discern if the speaker is pure in his spirit and single in his heart.</P><P>Sometimes problems and arguments arise among the brothers and sisters. If they have enough grace, they will behave according to what is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6, where some should be willing to suffer and to submit before the Lord. The problems will then be solved. But sometimes, neither side may be willing to suffer. Sometimes, one side may be willing to suffer, but the other side is not. Such things as these are often brought to the elders. At such times, how should you arbitrate? You cannot judge right away who is right and who is wrong. If you do this, you will have joined the battle and will be drawn into the dispute of right and wrong. If you really love the Lord and love the brothers, you will surely take their problem as your own pressing problem and will try to solve it before God. You will say to the Lord, "Lord, what shall we do? I do not know how to help these brothers. How should I help them without hurting them? How can they be perfected? How can they know themselves? And how can they have a more desperate pursuit after You?" Right away you can see that the matter is not so simple. This is more complicated than a doctor diagnosing an illness. You cannot base your judgment on right and wrong. You have to go beyond right and wrong to touch their inward condition. While you are listening to the two brothers, you must have the power of spiritual discernment.</P><P>The people of the world can only judge who is right and who is wrong; they can only tell who is reasonable and who is unreasonable, who has an argument and who does not. However, in the church we must go beyond right and wrong, and we must touch man's real condition before God. Perhaps a brother has all the reasons on his side, but you can sense that his condition before God is quite improper. I would like the brothers and sisters to know that if we in the church try to take care of such disharmony, disputes, and arguments, and we make judgments based on right and wrong, we will be damaging the brothers and sisters. You will surely say that the brother who has all the reasons is right, but this judgment will damage him. First, it will damage his spiritual condition before God. Second, it will put him into a situation where God will have to give him another chastisement. God will have to stretch forth His hand to chastise this brother once again. For him to be confronted with an unreasonable brother this time is a chastisement from God; it is a discipline of the Holy Spirit. But you have helped him to remove this discipline of the Holy Spirit and have helped him to justify himself. On the one hand, you have damaged his spiritual condition before God. On the other hand, you have put him in a situation where he will have to go through more severe dealings from God. This is not a profit to him.</P><P>Perhaps you will ask, "What then shall I do?" It is not a matter of what you should do. First, you must have the ability to discern. You must be able to discern that such a brother may have all the reasons, but his very person is wrong before God. If you can exercise your discernment to such an extent, you can help him. Gradually, you may fellowship with him and explain to him, "Brother, in this matter no doubt you are right. All the reasons are on your side. All the blame is on the other side. But brother, let me have some fellowship with you. In this matter, what is your inner feeling before God?" If you fellowship with him in such a way, you will be not only a severe judge, but a serious doctor; he will have no other way but to submit to you. He will say, "Although in this matter I am right, yet in these days my fellowship with the Lord is not as it was before. I do not feel any sweetness within. It seems that the Lord is not pleased with my condition." Once he says this word, you will have many opportunities to help him. Immediately you can tell him, "Brother, you are right. This is my feeling also. Although you were not wrong in this matter, I have been really concerned that your condition before God is off. I dare not speak for your side, because I am afraid that I may damage your spiritual condition before God and cause you to incur more severe dealings in the future." There is no need to speak too much; these few words will suffice; no doubt you will have given this brother some serious help. There is no need to judge who is right and who is wrong. This brother can have his problem solved from within, and solved before God. In the end, both brothers, the one who was right and the one who was wrong, are brought before God by you; both of them receive a solution from within. For this reason, brothers, the ability to discern is crucially related to the administration of the church!</P><P>We must believe that all the brothers and sisters are very much under the Lord's grace. On the other hand, we must also admit that we who are under God's grace are not so simple. We are a Jacob, a natural person, but we are also born again as Israel. Our expression is often that of Israel outwardly, but Jacob inwardly. Therefore, many times when brothers and sisters come to speak to you, you cannot believe them according to their words only. You must also have the ability to discern. You must enter into their spirit and touch the feeling of their spirit. For example, some brother may say: "I am saying these things not as slander against the elders." Yet, you can sense that he is altogether trying to slander the elders. Another may say, "I am not at all opposed to the responsible brothers. I can see that they are all quite good." Nevertheless, while he is speaking, you can feel that this person's spirit is definitely an opposing, judging spirit. It is true that they are not intentionally lying, but each of these is one person on the outside, and another inside. Here is the need for discernment. The elders' shepherding of the brothers and sisters and their handling of the affairs of the church, their judgments and their decisions, are all based on their ability to discern. If you have the spiritual discerning ability, nearly no one will be able to hide anything from you when they come before you and present their cases before you. You can discern a person to the marrow of the bone, penetrating him more than an x-ray. You can clearly discern the motive of this person and the spirit of this person, whether they are calm, tender, pure, and single. You can tell if this person is in resurrection or in the natural realm. You can have a thorough discernment of his condition.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Discerning the Truth</H2><P>When elders encounter problems, they must also be able to discern whether the matter is according to the truth. For example, a brother may suggest something to you and may enumerate many reasons to support himself, reasons which seem to be very good. But is the matter according to the truth? At such times, the elders need to have the ability to discern the truth.</P><P>The same principle applies in questions related to the church. The elders should have the ability to discern the truth concerning the way of the church, the ground of the church, the nature of the church, and the position of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Discerning Spiritual Gain and Loss</H2><P>In addition, discernment concerning spiritual gain and loss is also very important. For example, when you make a certain decision, you must be able to discern whether or not your decision will cause a gain or a loss to the brothers and sisters spiritually. Sometimes there is both gain and loss. In such cases, you have to discern whether there will be more gain or more loss, whether the gain can counterbalance the loss. All these matters depend on your discernment.</P><P>I can never forget how a brother who had helped us was sitting down with us one day. We were talking about the pressing circumstances that we were under at that time; we could not stop, but there was no way to go on. We had to turn either to the right or to the left, but either way we could turn would be difficult for us. What should we do? On that day, this brother gave an illustration. He said that it was like driving a car with another car coming head on from the opposite direction. The two cars were about to crash into each other. If you turn to the side, you would knock the rickshaws down. But there was not enough time to stop the car. Should you hit the car in front of you, or should you knock the rickshaws down? It all depends on your instant decision at that moment. Within the twinkling of an eye, you have to make the decision, to hit the car, or to knock the rickshaws down. Please remember that the church can sometimes be pressed by Satan to such an extent that it must, so to speak, either hit the car head on or knock the rickshaws down at the side; there is no way to escape a collision. At such times, you have to exercise your discernment of loss versus gain. If it means that you have to be decisive and that you have to "knock the rickshaws down," you should not be hesitant because you are caught in such a quandary. You should be able to make a swift judgment and to say that by so doing, you gain more than you lose. Of course, the gain and loss that we are talking about here refer to spiritual gains and losses.</P><P>Furthermore, you must be able to discern what kind of result this kind of action will lead to. You should be able to discern if these dealings with matters and people, and such settlements will be a gain tomorrow even when they are a loss today. You should also be able to discern if these dealings with matters and people, or such settlements will cause irreparable loss tomorrow despite their gain today. All these depend on your discernment. Some churches in the hands of some brothers have passed through some very difficult times. Yet in the end they found themselves in a broad land. Some other churches in the hands of other brothers went through easy times for a while, but suffered more and more difficulties as time has gone on.</P><P>During these years, among a few churches, often I have emphatically charged the brothers and sisters that they must take care of the young people. Because I emphasize this point, it makes the older ones feel very uncomfortable. Sometimes some of them say: "Brother Lee is simply causing the young people to rebel!" Today I speak this before the Lord. The reason I purposely encourage young people is that I clearly realize one thing: if a church cannot raise up the young people, this church has no future. If a local church that has been meeting for many years is not able to raise up the new ones to serve the Lord, it will be like a couple who have been married for many years without children. When this couple have grown old, what would happen to the family? This is why I conclude that a church must have young people at all costs. The church needs the second generation. The future of the church hinges on the young people. Here obviously there is a matter of discernment. You should not merely look up some old brothers for fellowship and find some old sisters with whom to pray; every day you work on the old brothers and sisters and leave the thirteen- to fifteen-year-old young ones to their studies. If you do this, the brothers and sisters in the church will all be old ones, and the elders, the deacons, and the responsible ones in the district will also be old ones. If this is the way you work, you will have sold out the church of God and will have hurt the brothers and sisters. Those who are thirteen will become twenty-three in ten years, and those who are in junior high school will be Ph.D.s in ten years. At the same time, do not forget that those who are in their fifties and sixties will soon be in their sixties and seventies. There is a real need of discerning ability here.</P><P>Brothers, let me repeat that it is not a simple thing to be an elder in the church. If we miss a little, we lose a soul. If we are off a little, a hundred will not be saved. You can see the seriousness here. Salvation and perdition hinge on the one thought of the elders. How then can you act properly and judge accurately? It all depends on your ability to discern. If you have discernment, the church will be brought onto the proper track. Only then will you have the real administration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. HOW TO HAVE THE DISCERNMENT</H2><P>The development of the ability to discern is based upon learning and experience. This is an ironclad rule. The amount of learning and experience we have determines the ability in discernment we will achieve. There is no shortcut or second way here. If I have not been saved, I can never differentiate who is saved and who is not. If I have not been consecrated, I can never sense who is consecrated and who is not. The degree of learning and experience you have before God is the degree of discernment you will have. The most profound discernment comes out of the most profound dealings. If you judge your motive and intention in everything before God, and if you judge and condemn everything that has impure motives or mixed intentions, it will be very easy for you to touch the motive and intention of the brothers and sisters; you will be able to sense them right away. At the same time, if you are one who has learned to judge your flesh and has dealt with your fleshly person, you will find most conspicuous the flesh in another person who is fleshly. You will have a keen spiritual sense of smell. This sense of smell becomes your discernment. We read in the Bible that a priest who serves God cannot have a flat nose (Lev. 21:18). The flat nose denotes a lack of spiritual sense and a lack of spiritual discerning ability.</P><P>If you have learned serious lessons in consecration and are fully under the Lord's authority, you will have a keen spiritual sense in this matter. Whenever you touch a person, you will immediately know if such a one has handed over his own rights before God. Although a person may be a preacher already, he nevertheless may not have given up his rights. Although a man may have sold all that he has and may have given everything away for the Lord's sake, yet he may still have not given up his rights. Although a person may sacrifice his body for others' sake and may be willing to be martyred for the Lord, he may still have his rights in his hand. If you have been exercised in the matter of consecration, you will be more sensitive than others in this matter, and no one will be able to deceive you. This special sensitive feeling is your discerning power.</P><P>Consider again the matter of truth. If you have never seriously studied the truth or practically learned it, you will not be able to have any discernment when you are confronted with any question regarding the truth; you will feel that everything is more or less the same. But those who have fought the battle in the truth and who have applied the truth will be experienced in the truth, and they will have the discernment in the truth. For example, several words may be similar in spelling. They may look the same, and most people may make a mistake concerning them, taking one for the other. But proofreaders will be able to spot the difference right away. The reason for this is that they are doing this every day. They are particularly experienced in the discernment of the characters. In the same way, there are many spiritual truths which are very similar one to another. There is definitely the distinction in discernment.</P><P>When I was young, I once heard a brother who was leading us answer a question involving the truth. I could not help but admire him. A problem arose; two things were very similar, and it was difficult to separate them. But, as soon as the question was raised, he immediately gave the answer and separated the two things clearly one from the other. No matter how many smoke screens there were in the question, once it was asked, he was clear already. His ability to discern truth had reached such an extent that when you asked him a question, he would know immediately what your next question would be. Many people could testify that they had originally intended to ask another question, but the answer to the first question stopped their mouths, and they no longer had any need for further questions. His discerning ability was so keen that no one could be sloppy before him.</P><P>In the local church there are also many difficulties and problems; they all appear ambiguous. If we do not have the discernment, we have no way to deal with them; the only thing we can do is let them go on. Please remember that this is the main reason the church becomes weaker and weaker, with sickness after sickness. There does not seem to be a way for anything; there does not seem to be an answer for anything. Everything is in confusion. In order for the church to be strong and have all things on the right track, the elders must have clear discernment. This discernment must not be something worldly or of man's wisdom and understanding. Rather, it must come from a man who has learned the lessons before the Lord, who has been dealt with, and who is exercised in the matter of truth.</P><P>Of course, in such a thing as the management of the church, you can never make anything absolute; everything is relative. Take man's behavior as an example. It is relative and is not absolute. One thousand persons have one thousand different ways of behavior. The same is true with the way people manage their homes; it is relative and not absolute. Each family has its own practice. In the same principle, the way to manage the church is also a relative matter; it is not absolute. This relativeness is based on the condition of the elders: if the standard of the elders is high, the management of the church will surely be high in standard. If the standard of the elders is low, the management of the church will surely be low in standard. May the Lord have mercy upon us that we will not be discouraged in these things; neither will we be proud. The demands here are relative, not absolute. On the other hand, they are also unlimited and boundless.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE COORDINATION OF THE ELDERS</H1><P>In the chapter regarding authority we have mentioned that the authority of the elders requires coordination. Thus, the coordination of the elders is closely related to their being the authority. If there is no coordination among the elders in a local church, regardless how strong an individual elder may be, his strength is of no avail. However, when the coordination of the elders exists, though the elders are weak, they can still stand and go on. Strength without coordination is useless, whereas weakness with coordination is tolerable. We can see that the coordination of the elders is of utmost importance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE ELDERS BEING PLURAL IN NUMBER</H2><P>The Bible shows us that in every church the elders should be plural in number. A church cannot have one elder only. If there is only one elder in a local church, the condition is abnormal and absolutely unscriptural. Regardless how young a church is, there should be at least two or three elders. For the sake of coordination, the elders must be plural in number. If an individual handles everything, bears everything, and deals with everything, it is as if he is but singing solos. However, the administration of the church is not a solo, but rather a chorus in a play. Therefore, the elders must coordinate together. Whenever the coordination is missing among the elders, they will become worthless. The worth of the elders depends upon their coordination. For this reason, the elders must be plural in number.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. A MINIATURE OF THE BODY</H2><P>The church is the Body of Christ. A local church is the expression of the Body of Christ in a locality, whereas the elders in a local church are the miniature of that expressed body. When the elders are together in coordination, they constitute the smallest form of this body, and as such they are the miniature of the Body of Christ.</P><P>In this age, God's greatest need is to have the church built up. Where there is no building, there is nearly no church. From the way the Israelites were arrayed according to their fathers' houses in the book of Numbers, we have seen how the church needs to be built up. In this building, the elders occupy a most important and distinctive position. If a church does not have any elders, not only will there be no building, but it will be extremely difficult to have a church at all. Without the elders, there is no way to talk about the building.</P><P>In order for a church to be built up, there is first the need for the elders to be built up. How can a church be built up if its elders are not built up? The building of the church is a matter of the coordination of the saints, but if the elders within a church cannot coordinate together, how can they help the brothers and sisters to coordinate? Therefore, the building and the coordination in the church are entirely in the hands of its elders, and they are dependent upon them. Moreover, the elders must be the initiators and the examples in the building of the church. If there is no real building and coordination among the elders, there will be no initiators of the building up and the coordination of the church. In other words, there cannot be a beginning, and there is no way for the matter to be realized. Hence, for the sake of the building of the church, the elders must be the model and example of coordination. This model and example is the initiator in a local church. Only by this way can the few elders in a practical way build up and coordinate the saints together. They can do this because there is a model seen in them already. Spontaneously, they can take the saints on in this way of coordination and building.</P><P>Hence, we see that God's will depends on the church, and the church is fully a matter of coordination and building, while the coordination and building of the church hinges fully on the elders. The elders are the smallest miniature of the Body. If there is no coordination and building with the elders, there will be no way to talk about the coordination and building up of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE NEED TO BE CAPABLE IN EVERYTHING</H2><P>It is not enough for an elder to be capable on one point, in one area, or with one part only; elders have to be capable in everything. The elders must be able to think, to endeavor, to oversee, to foresee, and to achieve. They must be able to protect, to resist, and to build. There is the need for them to be all-inclusive in their ability. Many of the brothers sitting here have the experience of being an elder. Surely, many times they feel that they cannot meet the many needs of the church. There are many things we should see that we have not seen. There are many things we should think of that we have not thought of. There are many things we should guard against that we have foolishly not guarded against. There are many things we should have brought up, but we have neglected them. There are many things we should have done, but we have missed the opportunity. There are many things we should have said but did not say. There are some things we should deal with but do not know how to deal with. There are many things we should solve, take the lead in, or help with, but we do not have the way to do what we should do. We know we need to study the Bible, but we do not know how to do it. Surely we know that we should preach the gospel, but we do not know how to do it. From our experience, we have found that the elders have to be capable in everything. Yet, in many areas we have fallen short. For this reason, we have to see that the elders must be coordinated, because no one person is capable in everything.</P><P>A member cannot be capable in everything; only the body is capable in everything. The eyes can only see. The ears can only hear. The hands can only work, and the feet can only walk. There is no way for a member to be capable in everything. Any brother or sister can only have that little bit of gift that he or she has; he or she cannot be capable in everything. Even the apostle Paul had to admit that he could not do Peter's work, or James' work, or John's. Although Paul was a multi-talented apostle, and although he was gifted in many ways, he was very weak in areas other than his specialties. He could not replace the specialty of Peter, nor that of John.</P><P>When the elders in the church see the need to be capable in everything, immediately they will realize the need of coordination. It is impossible for you alone to meet the many needs in the church. Perhaps you are skillful in planning, yet you may not be able to carry out your plans practically. Perhaps you are good in working, but you are very weak in planning. You may be especially good in shepherding, but you may be very weak in handling business affairs. You may be very good in handling business affairs, but you may come short in the supply of life. Hence, you can see that no elder can meet all the needs. To meet all the needs, the elders must be coordinated.</P><P>It is regrettable to see elders serving together without having the consciousness that they have to be in coordination in order to be capable in everything. If we see that members of the same body do not have the same function, we will realize that the gifts of the elders are also different. Some must be the hand, others the foot, the eye, or the mouth. For example, you cannot expect every elder to have discernment; some elders need others to be their discernment. Some elders may be very discerning, yet they are not warm; they need others' warmth. Many times, those who are fervent in heart are blind in their eyes, and those who are sharp in their eyes are cold in their hearts. The clearer a person sees, the colder his heart becomes. The more fervently a person loves, the more foolish he becomes. This is why we must all coordinate together. Those with sharp eyes need others to be their heart, and those who are too fervent in heart need others to be their eyes.</P><P>For example, you may feel a certain brother is very lovable. You must not love him without consideration; instead, you should first bring the matter to the fellowship among the elders and allow the discerning ones to judge the matter. If you accept this coordination, you will have discernment. Likewise, if you have discernment, there is no need for you to exercise this discernment directly. If you do, you will probably become a knife or a gun to others; you are too sharp, and therefore you must be coordinated with someone else. You can be to others their discernment, and others can be to you your mouth. Perhaps a message needs to be given, but you cannot give the message because you do not have the gift of speaking. You have only the discernment; you cannot be the mouthpiece. You can then present your feeling to the elders in fellowship and accept the coordination of those elders who are the speaking ones. When they speak, you will feel that it is not they alone who are speaking, but the speaking of the elders in coordination. In this speaking, there is discernment, as well as warm love. Apparently, in this message, some of the elders release their words. Actually, the message is the result of the fellowship of the elders. In this fellowship, there is discernment and warmth, as well as spiritual light and experience. It is a message, but within it is the coordination that includes all kinds of gifts.</P><P>Brothers, I do hope that the elders in all the localities would manifest all the gifts this way. In order to do this, there must be the coordination. You cannot depend on yourself all the time, thinking that you have utterance, foresight, and love. I do not believe in this, and I hope you would not believe in this either. Perhaps you have only foresight, but you do not have love. Perhaps you have only love but are poor in your sight. Even if you possess both, your mouth may not be capable. Do not put too much trust in yourselves. The elders must fellowship together; they must put their love into the fellowship, their foresight into the fellowship, their light of life, and their experience into the fellowship. After this, one or two elders can be the utterance. Only then will this utterance include everything. I believe the brothers and sisters can see the riches, strength, and beauty of this coordination. Since the elders need to be capable in everything, they must be in coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE MANIFOLD GIFTS</H2><P>A church is like a family. Not only does it have to have those who are capable in everything; it must have those who are gifted in all areas. The sisters who are housewives know the great needs there are in a family. The parents have to be able to do everything in the house. They have to know how to cook, to sew, to wash, to iron, to fix up the house, to teach, to correspond, and to send telegrams; they have to be the doctor, the nurse, and the coolie as well. Sometimes when there is the need to plant some flowers, they have to be gardeners. When the door or window is broken, they have to be carpenters. When the light goes out, or the fuse is burned out, and it is not convenient to find an electrician, they have to be electricians themselves. In a family, you cannot depend on craftsmen for everything; the parents have to learn to do everything on a daily basis. The same is true with the church. The elders cannot depend all the time on the so-called apostles and the specially gifted workers to do everything. Perhaps the apostles will not visit them for three or five years. In such a case, the elders have to do everything themselves. They have to help the brothers and sisters to read the Bible, to have spiritual pursuits, to learn to pray, to have dealings before the Lord, to learn to coordinate, to serve together, and to open up house after house for the gospel. All these things are what the elders should do. Sometimes the elders have to make business arrangements. Here, the question of capability and gifts is involved.</P><P>Some elders among us also have the ministry in the Word, but they do not have the gift of administration. These brothers should understand that they are profiting from the shining of others. Others have set up a framework for them. They are having a little work, a little bit of ministry of the Word, and a little bit of usefulness under the framework of an administration. But I am afraid that these brothers do not have this kind of feeling. They may feel that their ministry of the Word is everything. Little do they realize that when others' ministry is removed, they will be totally stripped of everything. By that time they will realize that everything they have is up in the air and that none of what they have can be sustained without a framework.</P><P>On the other hand, those who are good in administration should also realize that their administration is but a framework; it is only a set of arrangements and guidelines. They should realize that they lack the living anointing and the rich word. All these things show us that before the Lord, gifts are varied. Every elder in the church should know his own portion and should respect others' portions. Only in this way will the manifold gifts be manifested among the elders. This is a beautiful thing!</P><P>For some brothers, the minute they open their mouth, what comes out is the gospel. For some others, the minute they open their mouth, what comes out is perfecting. There is no way for others to imitate them; these are their gifts. Still some cannot open their mouths at all; yet they can contact others. Of course, this contact is not a matter of fostering natural relationships, but a matter of spiritual fellowship. No matter what kind of problem there is, as soon as these brothers go and fellowship, the problem is swallowed up by life. No matter what kind of weakness there is, as soon as these brothers pay a visit, the weakness goes away. No matter what kind of opinion there may be, when these brothers step in, the opinion is gone. No matter what kind of death, rumors, or criticisms are spread among the brothers and sisters, when these brothers go and fellowship, these things all disappear. These ones have such a gift. They cannot give a message, they cannot preach the gospel, they cannot administrate the church, but they have the specialty of being good at fellowship. Once they fellowship, life is supplied, and death is swallowed.</P><P>With some, you have to admit that as soon as the Bible is put in their hand, it becomes transparent. No matter which book, chapter, or paragraph they expound, it is always clear and enlightening. You may study the same passage a thousand times, but the more you study it, the more your head spins. But when they stand up to say a few words, everything becomes clear. The reason is simple: they have the gift of being a teacher. It is useless to be proud. This is a question of gift. Those who are overseeing the house of God should realize that God's house needs all kinds of gifts.</P><P>I always rejoice in my heart and am thankful to the Lord because there are many members in His house and they have many gifts. I cannot do many things the brothers are able to do. I cannot help in many things the brothers are able to help in. I am not able to render supply in many things the brothers are able to render supply in. This is coordination. Dear brothers, the more we understand this matter clearly, the safer our coordination is.</P><P>We should feel it to be a very sweet thing that when our brother preaches the gospel, many are saved. We should feel it to be a very sweet thing that when our brother stands up to say a few words, everyone is enlightened. With all the problems, we should feel it to be a sweet thing that when a few brothers go out to visit and to fellowship, all the problems are solved. I cannot say that it is sweet because I did it, and that it is not sweet when others do it. It is not a question of me doing it or others doing it. The question is whether or not there is such a thing in the church. If there is such a thing, whether it is done by me or by others, it is equally sweet. This is coordination. I should be faithful to contribute my portion. As for others' portions, I should not only honor them, but consider them to be sweet. I can praise the others' portions and will not despise even the smallest portion among them.</P><P>On the Lord's Day morning, I often see some brothers and sisters cleaning the windows and mopping the floors in the meeting hall. They come all the time from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. I feel that this is very sweet. I feel that their service may be sweeter in the eyes of God than what we do as ministers of the Word on the podium. I have seen some older sisters who come to clean almost every week from the beginning of the year to the end. The Lord can testify for me that I have the utmost respect for these sisters. This is a coordination.</P><P>In the church there is the need for manifold gifts. Since elders are the miniature of the church, the elders must also have manifold gifts. Under normal conditions, the gifts you can find in the brothers and sisters should also be found among the elders. The elders are their representatives. Some represent service, some, administration, some, the ministry of the Word, some, the leading in life, and some, teaching. The elders should have the manifold gifts to represent the others and to take the lead. In this way the blessings will be full in the church, and many spiritual riches will be manifested. In this way, the building of the church will be solid, and the coordination, fitting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE MEANING OF COORDINATION</H2><P>In order to be capable in everything, there is the need for coordination. In order to have the manifold gifts, there is also the need for coordination. Many times, I am distressed about the elders in certain localities, because among them you do not see any coordination. Three or five of them may be meeting, discussing and planning there, yet among them there is no coordination. What is coordination? It means that your portion is here, my portion is here, and his portion is also here; everyone's portion is here. Yet all are in coordination. However, this is not what we see in some places. What the condition of some seems to say is that unless a certain one puts out all his portions, he will not put out anything. It is either everything or nothing. To them, it is either one person's portion, or another person's portion. If it is not your portion, then it is my portion. Either I do it all, or I do not do anything at all. This is absolutely not coordination. The real coordination means that your portion is here, my portion is here, and everyone else's portion is here.</P><P>In some local churches I have indeed seen this kind of coordination where everyone is included. When an action is taken, everyone's portion goes into it. No one would say that if he does it, he does it all, and if he does not do it, he will not have anything to do with it. Rather, everyone speaks, and every brother's portion is put into it. I may not be the one who is speaking today, but when one brother speaks, in his speaking there is my opinion and my feeling. Although I do not make the arrangements and I am not responsible for a certain district or a certain hall, yet within that overseeing there is my portion, because in some areas there is my view, my suggestions, and my fellowship. It does not mean that since a hall is not under my care, I will therefore not touch it at all. We cannot say that such-and-such a responsibility rests on one elder and that such-and-such a hall rests on another elder. We have to see that the responsibility of the whole church rests on the shoulders of all the elders. Here is the need for fellowship and coordination.</P><P>When all the elders are meeting together for business, none should feel that he is the responsible brother of a certain district or a certain meeting hall. The elders should only feel that they are the responsible brothers of the whole church. All the elders are the responsible ones of the church. This is why all are coordinating and fellowshipping together. When a matter is fellowshipped thoroughly enough, the feeling of God is touched, and the decision is made to do something, of course not all the elders will be involved in the work; there has to be the distribution of work. Some matters should be handled by you, while others should be handled by me. But no matter who does what, we are all doing the things together.</P><P>Unfortunately, in many local churches this is not the case. When a matter is taken up by a certain elder, it becomes his responsibility. When another matter is taken up by another elder, it becomes that other elder's responsibility. When I do it, it is my job. When he does it, it has nothing to do with me anymore. Actually, there should not be feelings of this kind. When one elder speaks in one district, it should be the whole eldership speaking. When one elder makes some arrangements in one meeting hall, it should be the whole eldership making the arrangement there. This is because there is a coordination. Without fellowship and coordination, no one elder should speak and act independently, for to do so would annul the fact that the elders are plural in number. The elders are not one, but many. Whenever the elders move and speak, they do so with one another. It is not just a matter of representing one another, but a matter of being with one another. Every report is something that represents the whole eldership, because it is something that the whole eldership has fellowshipped about and is doing in coordination. For this reason, the elders must be in coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE WAY OF COORDINATION</H2><P>The way for elders to coordinate is a very important subject, but it is hard to define. We will consider this matter under several points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Learning to Accept Authority</H2><P>Once we touch the matter of coordination, we will realize it is not something two-dimensional, but something three- dimensional. Anything that is two-dimensional is not very useful. Once it becomes three-dimensional, it becomes useful. For example, a house is three-dimensional, and a body is three-dimensional. The church is a house. As such it must be three-dimensional. The church is also a body. As such it must also be three-dimensional. Since the elders represent the church, in all aspects they must be three-dimensional. It is a big failure for the elders to practice democracy among themselves. What is democracy? It is the consent of the majority. On the other hand, if there is autocracy within the eldership, and there is only one man giving commands, we also have a worldly situation. The administration in the church is neither a democracy nor an autocracy. It is not the opinion of the people, nor the proposal of one. It is fully a matter of God's presence. God's presence is the authority. In order to have the coordination, all the elders have to accept authority and to accept the ordering in the authority. Every elder should know where he stands in this order. As an elder, you have to find out among the elders your authority. Coordination in the church is neither a democracy nor an autocracy, but a body principle.</P><P>Those who are the authority need others' coordination to touch the sense of God. The head feels through the members. In the same way, many times those who are the authority do not sense anything directly, but their sensing is through those with whom they are coordinating. Those who coordinate with you as elders may not be your authority, but they are your sensing organs. If you as the authority lack these sensing organs, you will not be able to touch the sense of the body. This is why we cannot be proud here; we depend on each other with our lives. I can have a certain sense, yet I am not the authority. Another may be the authority, yet he does not have the sense. Hence, we must all depend on each other with our lives.</P><P>Under normal circumstances, when eight or ten elders come together, they should not adopt a congressional system and should not look for a democratic solution. Rather, they should open to one another and fellowship in the Holy Spirit. Every elder should learn to fear the Lord and to live before the Lord. They should learn to present all their feelings concerning a certain matter. Those elders who are the authority should also learn to fear the Lord, to be without preconceptions, prejudice, or bias, and to listen to this fellowship and to touch the brothers' feelings. After they have sensed the intention of the Holy Spirit, those who are the authority can make the decision and can announce that the matter should be taken care of in a certain way. If they do this, the result will not be democracy or autocracy, but will be something that issues from the Holy Spirit.</P><P>The situation in Acts 15 was neither democratic nor autocratic; it was a situation like the one we have just described. Everyone opened himself in the Holy Spirit and fellowshipped what he had encountered, what he felt, and what he had observed. In the end, James, who was the authority at that time, after hearing all the words, stood up and stated the way they should proceed. Immediately after James stood up and spoke, no one had anything more to say. This is the principle of authority.</P><P>The elders should know the place the Lord has put them in, whether as the authority, or as those under authority. They should know in what order the Lord has placed them, whether they are the first or the second. They should know the order here. To know the order is to know authority. You have to accept this authority. Otherwise, there will be no possibility for the elders to be coordinated together. If you feel that you are an elder and that others are also the elders, and if everybody feels the same way, what you have is just like a board of directors in the world. You are a director, and I am a director. All directors are equal. The chairman of the board is no higher than other directors; he merely possesses a little power in convening others and in representing them. All matters are still decided by everyone. This is the way of the world. The elders are not a board of directors. They live in the spirit, accept the authority, and know in what order they are placed. If the elders do not do these things, their coordination will never be solid.</P><P>However, the coordination of the elders not only requires some to submit to authority, but some to be the authority as well. If no one assumes any authority, the coordination will not be normal either. Suppose in a local church there are five elders. One of them is obviously the authority; he is obviously the first. But in all the discussions, this number one elder is shy and withdrawn, and he tries purposely to show everyone that he has not assumed any authority, that he is allowing the Lord to be the Lord, and that he is not assuming any lordship. A matter can drag on and on in discussion without any conclusion. In the end, when no conclusion can be reached, he will say, "Since everybody feels this way, shall we decide the matter this way?" Not until everyone says that this is good is the matter settled. This is a very ugly scene, for no one is the authority here. This is not humility. This is another expression of the flesh. It is the flesh transformed into another appearance.</P><P>A person who knows the order and who truly represents authority is not like this. Suppose here is a matter to be handled. At the beginning, he would allow the brothers to speak about their feelings. One brother may feel one thing, and another brother may feel another thing. Every brother would speak out what he feels. If I am the one who should act as the head, I should fear God. I should not have any preconception, prejudice, or bias, but should simply touch everyone's feeling. In the end, when I am clear within and am peaceful, I will say, "Brothers, if that is the case, let us make such-and-such a decision." Every time we discuss any matter, we should learn not to have any arguments, nor to ignore any inward feelings. If any of the brothers feel there is something wrong with the decision, he can still speak out his feeling. The leading one should still listen to this feeling in a serious way and should still consider it. This is the way for the elders to coordinate in the church. Among the elders there is no democracy or autocracy; everyone submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit. No one is too aggressive, or at all passive. Instead everyone places himself fully among the elders. Everyone knows in what order he is placed, and everyone accepts the authority without insisting on anything or resisting any responsibility. This is the way to coordinate together.</P><P>Hence, the coordination of the elders in the church requires that everyone be free from the self, fear God, and live in the Holy Spirit. It requires that none be too assertive, and none be at all withdrawn. There should be no pretense of humility, and no element of overstepping the Lord. Everyone should live before the Lord in fear and trembling; everyone should stay in his place. All of the elders should fellowship together according to their inner sense and should arrive at an accurate feeling based on this. We should believe that this kind of feeling is of the Lord. Hence, the accepting of authority and the knowledge of order is a necessary point in our coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Willing to Be Broken</H2><P>In order for the elders to be coordinated, everyone must also be willing to be broken. Without brokenness, there is still no possibility of coordination. A person cannot assert himself, protect himself, and preserve himself, and at the same time coordinate with others properly. You may be the best one in preaching, in administration, or in visitation, but even in your specialty, you have to learn to be broken. If you are only good in administration without being broken, you will not be able to coordinate with those who can preach or who can visit others. You may feel that without your administration, the preaching and visitation of others are of no use. Others may feel that without their preaching, there is no way for those who can only administrate and visit to go on. To have such a feeling means that you are absolutely not broken. This is to annul others and to exalt yourself, to set yourself up and to trample others underfoot. You should say, "Thank the Lord. Although the Lord has granted me mercy and has given me a little gift of administration, the church still needs the speaking and the visitation." Another may say, "Perhaps the Lord has given me a little gift of speaking, but there is still the need of administration and visitation." I may say, "Perhaps the Lord has given me a little gift of shepherding and visitation, but I deeply feel that without the brothers' administration and their supply in the Word, my visitation would be useless." If we say this, there will be the sense of brokenness. Here the self is overturned, yet no one has forsaken his own portion.</P><P>This is not all. Only after the elders are broken will they not argue when they discuss matters. Any argument is a sign of unbrokenness. A broken elder has no argument; he knows in what order he is set. He can speak out his feeling in a serious way, but after he speaks, if the leading elder continues with his decision, he is able to submit himself to it. It does not mean that you will not speak out your feeling when you accept the authority. Nor does it mean that when you speak out your feeling you are not accepting authority. Everyone has to learn to have no arguments and to obey. The leading ones may make wrong decisions and wrong moves. But if everyone would take this way, there will still be a coordination, and there will still be the blessing. Everyone is still fully one and in harmony. All wrong decisions and wrong moves can easily be adjusted. This is because everyone is broken and is not insisting. Once the leading one discovers that the decision is wrong, he should be able to say humbly, "Brothers, I am sorry that my decision was wrong. Let us change it right away." How beautiful this picture will be!</P><P>I hope that the brothers would see that if we insist on anything in an unbroken spirit and atmosphere, even if what we insist on is right, we have to expect a considerable problem. I am not saying that we should not insist. But we have to learn to be broken, and even if we insist on something, we still have to be broken. Some brothers are not insisting, yet they are not broken at all. My opinion may not get through in a matter. Subsequently, I will not insist. But neither will I touch the matter or inquire about it any further; I will just let it go by. Please remember that this way of not insisting is the strongest protection and preservation of oneself. Hence, all the time we must learn to be a broken person among the brothers. Of course, this requires God's grace and the work of the Holy Spirit. We must be smitten by God before we can be a broken person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Be Open</H2><P>All those who do not open themselves to the brothers are keeping themselves whole. As such, it is impossible for them to coordinate. Many problems result from a lack of openness, the most serious of which is misunderstanding. If you never open up yourself or share your feeling with others, but you hold on to what you consider as right, misunderstanding and misinterpretation will very easily result. This misunderstanding is the enemy's most serious weapon to destroy coordination. I know of some places where elders cannot be coordinated together simply because of misunderstanding. Wherever misunderstanding occurs and exists, coordination is finished. Everyone may still be able to come together for talks and discussions, but it will be of no avail, because the germ of misunderstanding has killed the life of coordination.</P><P>Openness can solve many problems. Sometimes there are problems among the brothers. Do not avoid the problems; rather face them head on. Suppose you avoid the problem, and I avoid the problem; the more we avoid it, the closer we will become, and the closer we become, the more misunderstanding there will be. This is only the problem on the negative side. On the positive side, a person who is not open cannot supply others with grace and life, and cannot receive others' supply. This is because there is no flow between you and others; what is in you cannot flow out, and what is in others cannot flow into you. Hence, in order to coordinate together, everyone must be open.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Humble yet Not Passive</H2><P>In order to coordinate together well, the elders need to be humble and not be passive. I may be a very humble person. Yet at the same time I am very positive. When a person is humble, it is easy for him to be passive. But when a person is positive, it is not easy for him to be humble. This is common human nature. But in the coordination, we have to learn to be humble without being passive. I have to touch everything, and I want to participate in everything. I have my view in everything, and I am happy to express my feeling in everything. Yet I remain humble. This humility with this positiveness is a difficult lesson to learn. It is not easy for those who are positive to be humble, and it is not easy for those who are humble to be positive. In order to be humble as well as positive, there is the need for grace and for brokenness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Always Accepting the Balancing of Others</H2><P>If you are one who visits others, you need to be balanced a little by administration. If you are one who administrates, you need to be balanced a little by the ministry of the Word. If you are one who ministers the Word, you should be balanced a little by administration. If you are one who cares for the spiritual direction among the brothers and sisters, you should be balanced a little by the gospel. If you are one who is very zealous for the preaching of the gospel, you have to be balanced a little by the administration of the church and the edification of the saints. In the coordination, we have to learn to be balanced all the time. Do not be like Martha, who accused Mary before the Lord and complained that she did everything and that Mary did nothing, except to sit at His feet to listen to His preaching! To be balanced is a serious factor in coordination. We have to be so balanced that whatever the brothers and sisters do, as long as they would not cause an obvious offense to the Lord, we will accept it.</P><P>For example, a brother may suggest that we preach the gospel. We should try our best to accept this suggestion. If another brother suggests a Bible study, we should also try our best to accept it. You have to accept the suggestions to such an extent that others will realize that it is not a rejection of the idea of gospel preaching, but a lack of time that there is no gospel preaching, and it is not a refusal to have a Bible study, but an impossibility in the schedule that there is no Bible study. However, you must not take this as an excuse to be a politician. What does it mean to take an excuse to be a politician? Suppose a brother suggests to you to have a Bible study. You do not like Bible studies, and you have no intention of accepting this proposal anyway. According to your choice, you would rather pray. However, you are a politician, and you take an excuse by saying that Monday is a meeting for the responsible brothers, Tuesday is prayer meeting, Wednesday is a meeting for beginners, Thursday is for gospel preaching, and Friday and Saturday are for such-and-such events, that there is therefore no more time. You know in your heart that you are lying to your brother. Within you, it is not a question of being too busy, but a question of unwillingness to accept the suggestion; you are merely taking an excuse. Please remember that the first time you take an excuse, the others may not notice it. But sooner or later, others will notice it. We cannot deceive even our children all the time. How much less can we deceive a grown-up? The first time you lie to others, they may believe you. But the next time you give them the same thing, they will know that you are being cunning, that you are taking an excuse, and that you are a politician. For this reason, the elders have to learn to accept something from their hearts. If they really cannot accept something, they can keep silence. Otherwise, they should tell others honestly, "Brother, I do not agree with having a Bible study." Do not take an excuse and be a politician, making political statements. I can tell the brothers and sisters soberly that in the past years, I have seen the results produced by this kind of earthly wisdom; they are more damaging than the results of speaking honest words. Many times it is better to speak honest words. If something is yes, simply say yes. If something is no, simply say no. If the others cannot accept my word, I can withhold my words, but I must never make excuses.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE RESULTS OF COORDINATION</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Harmony</H2><P>With such a coordination, the church will surely be in harmony. Disharmony in the church is fully caused by the elders. If the elders are in harmony, it is impossible for the brothers and sisters not to be in harmony. The elders are the source of harmony in the church. I do not at all like to go to a church in disharmony. That is a most painful experience. A church in disharmony is a punishment to the brothers and sisters. How sweet, peaceful, and happy a thing it is to have harmony in the church!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Authority</H2><P>The authority of the elders rests upon their harmony. A brother once asked the elders, "You tell me to submit to authority. But if the elders are not in harmony, whose authority do you expect me to submit to? Which head should I submit to?" This is an honest statement. If the elders are not in harmony, there will be no authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Life</H2><P>One thing is sure: where harmony is, there is authority, and where authority is, there is life. The living water of life flows out from the throne. The bud shoots forth from the top of the rod. Resurrection life is derived from authority, and the authority of the elders comes from the harmony among them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Fruit</H2><P>If the elders are in harmony, and if they have the authority and the life, whatever they do will bear good results. If they preach the gospel, people will be saved. If they edify others, others will get the help. If they visit, people will be revived. The church will be very prolific, and there will be clusters of fruit. I can tell the brothers and sisters that a barren church is surely a sign of the disharmony of the elders. When the elders are in harmony, there will be authority and life; there will be the begetting and nurturing power, and there will be the abundant fruit. Hence, the brothers have to realize that our gains and losses are small matters. The big question is the harmony in the church. If the Lord does not have a way, if hundreds of thousands of souls are not saved, if many are not perfected and are not truly built together, the blame rests on the elders. Once the elders have a good coordination, immediately a harmonious spirit will be produced. This is authority, and this is life. Under such circumstances, whatever they do, there will be abundant fruit because God's presence is there. May the Lord be merciful to us, and grant us to learn this serious lesson, so that the Lord's blessing can be poured out among us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE KNOWLEDGE<br>CONCERNING BOUNDARIES</H1><P>Today we want to speak concerning another matter related to the administration of the elders. It is the knowledge concerning boundaries. Perhaps you have never realized that the knowledge of boundaries would have much to do with the administration of the elders. You may not even understand what the word boundaries means. But I believe after you have read through this chapter you will become very clear.</P><P>First, let us consider the matter from the angle of God's work. Whether it is in God's creation or in God's redemption, there are always clear boundaries. For example, Genesis 1 speaks of God's creation. There the phrase "after their kind" is often repeated. Although there are many kinds of plant life, yet each is after its kind. Although there are many kinds of animal life, each is also after its kind. Although all of them are all life, they are after their own kind. Whether it is the plant life or the animal life, each of them has its boundary. Whenever these boundaries are exceeded, confusion immediately follows. Therefore, when we come to Leviticus and Deuteronomy, in God's commandments to His people there are many references to the question of boundaries. It is forbidden that two kinds of lives be mixed together. For example, God prohibited two kinds of seeds to be planted together in the same field. He also would not allow both an ox and an ass to bear the same yoke. He would not permit the wearing of clothing with two different fibers woven together. Also God forbade men to wear women's clothing, and women to wear men's clothing. In the New Testament, and especially in the Epistles, you can also find many teachings related to the matter of boundaries. Today, we do not have the time to look into them. What we are doing here is only to bring out an issue, which is that in God's work He has set up all kinds of boundaries. Whenever these boundaries are broken down, there will be confusion, and God's work will be destroyed.</P><P>The administration of the church also has many boundaries. If such were not the case, there would be no need for administration, and there would be no need for men to take up responsibility. The Bible shows us that in the church there are elders, deacons, and many other gifted persons. All the services must be in proper order and according to the proper principles, and everything should have its definite boundary. In order for us to administrate the church, we must have a very clear knowledge concerning the matter of boundaries. Now we will consider twelve different kinds of boundaries.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN<br>THE ELDERS AND THE DEACONS</H2><P>The elders in the church are the ones who conduct the administration of the church. They are the ones who govern, rule, administer, and conduct affairs. The function of the deacons in the church is in the nature of service. Their work is much like what is commonly spoken of as business affairs. Everything in the church should be proposed and decided by the elders, and all the business affairs in the church should be carried out and executed by the deacons. The boundary between these two things should be very clear. Otherwise, sometimes the elders will be doing the work of the deacons, and the deacons will be doing the work of the elders.</P><P>Certain things that should be done by the deacons are done by the elders. Thus, the elders have overstepped the functions of the deacons. Take, for instance, the matter of arranging the meeting hall. How should the hall be arranged? When should it be arranged? Proposals and decisions in these matters are for the elders to make. But when the hall is actually being arranged, the matter should be handed over to the deacons. If the elders have to be involved directly with this kind of arranging work, the elders have done the work of the deacons. On the one hand, such a thing puts the deacons out of a job. On the other hand, the more important works that the elders should have done are left undone. Hence, we see that this kind of practice is entirely a damage to the church.</P><P>On the other hand, the affairs of the church should be conducted and decided by the elders. But suppose the elders neglect their duties and leave it to the deacons to make decisions. The deacons do not represent the authority and do not know the condition of the whole church. When they make proposals regarding the church, this will affect the atmosphere of the church. The reason these abnormalities occur is that the elders are not clear about the matter of boundaries. Therefore, all proposals in the church must definitely be initiated by the elders, and as much as possible all services in the church must be handed over to the deacons.</P><P>The elders must stay within their own boundaries. They must only do the things that are within their boundaries and must let the deacons do the things that should be done by the deacons. This is a difficult thing for the elders to do, because the elders will then have to be responsible to bring in some deacons. Many are of the disposition that since they can take care of the matters by themselves, it would be more convenient to do the things by themselves. In that way, they could do things the way they want. It would be very inconvenient to bring along someone else in the work. Not only will they be restricted, but they will have to learn to be humble and to accept the dealings. This is why many times the elders simply take the shortcut and do the work themselves. When they do this once, twice, three times, four times, on and on, it becomes impossible for the deacons to be perfected.</P><P>When the elders do the work of the deacons, they will neglect the work that they themselves should do. For example, they should know how to lead different kinds of people on in the church. They should know how to seize the opportunity to preach the gospel and to build up the saints. These are the things concerning which the elders should receive positive leadings from the Lord; they should plan and endeavor like those who are engaging in a business. It would be a great mistake if the elders neglect this aspect of the work and engage themselves in arranging chairs and tables, taking care of the cleaning, and trying to meet other practical needs.</P><P>For instance, the church here has over thirty separate district meetings. Under normal circumstances, every district should be strong. Not only does this require the responsible ones in the districts to take up the leadership, but it requires the attention of the elders. The elders must study the condition of each district. How is the condition in this district, and in that district? If the condition is not good, what is the reason? Is it because the supply in the Word is weak? Is it because the administration or the coordination is not right? Is it because there are weaknesses in the services or in the gospel? Once they have found the reason, they have to render help according to the practical need. If one district is lacking in the supply of the Word, those among the elders who are more outstanding in the ministry of the Word should pick up the burden to render help and to strengthen the supply of the Word. Perhaps another district is incompetent in handling their business affairs. Those among the elders who are good at service should go there to help them. The elders should spend the energy, strength, and time to strengthen the meetings in all the districts, and to bring every one of the thirty or more districts up to the standard. These are the things the elders should do.</P><P>Take another example: in the church there are also the meetings in the different meeting halls. There are the Lord's Day morning message meetings and the mid-week Bible study meetings. The elders have to pay attention to the atmosphere of these meetings, the messages given in these meetings, the number in attendance, and the condition of attendance. All these things take time. As to the cleaning of the chairs and the tables, the elders need only to oversee generally. The work itself should be handed over to the deacons.</P><P>These are only examples. The elders should always take care of the big, high, important, developing, advancing, promoting, and building works within the church. As to the other affairs, they should only lay down some general guidelines and should hand them over to the deacons. This is the only way to effect a division of labor, and it is the only way to produce the manpower.</P><P>In the church, one should see a beautiful picture of the elders learning to be the authority in humility and patience, teaching others and leading them on, while the deacons are learning to submit to authority, to be led, and to serve properly. Everyone should stay in their place, and everyone should function to the best of their capacity. This requires that the elders know the boundary between the two kinds of people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE ELDERS<br>AND THE OTHER BROTHERS AND SISTERS</H2><P>The boundary between the elders and the other brothers and sisters is also an important matter. It is true that we all are God's children; the elders are God's children together with all the other brothers and sisters. From this point of view, there certainly is no boundary. But from another point of view, the ones functioning as elders bear the heavy responsibility of the church. As such, there is a boundary between responsibility and no responsibility. This does not mean that there is a hierarchy and a high place, as if the elders are higher than the others. To have such a feeling is ugly. The boundary we are talking about here is absolutely a matter of responsibility.</P><P>For example, concerning certain matters, the elders should only talk to other elders about them; it is not convenient for them to talk these things over with the other brothers and sisters, because there is a question of responsibility involved. The same is true within a family. A family may have eight or nine brothers and sisters. The oldest brother and sister of course help in taking the responsibility. From the standpoint of the children, all of them are the same; there is no boundary. But from the standpoint of family responsibility, the oldest brother and sister share in the responsibility of the family. Matters of responsibility are known to them only. They can talk among themselves, but they should set up a boundary between them and their younger brothers and sisters. This is true even with a unit as small as the family. How much more true it is with a place as great as the house of God. Surely the elders cannot discuss freely with the other brothers and sisters everything that they know. If they do this, they have no boundary, and the result could be quite damaging.</P><P>Not only to the other brothers and sisters, but to the deacons, there is no need to confide many things. This is not to say that the church is divided into ranks. This is a question of responsibility and degree. There is a real need of consideration of boundary here.</P><P>Suppose a brother has difficulty with his wife at home. The matter can be brought up in the elders' meeting, and the elders can discuss ways to help the situation. The elders can know about this, for they are the elders in the church, and they are responsible for caring for the brothers and sisters and shepherding them. But under different circumstances, and with other brothers and sisters present, the elders should not bring up the matter, for if others know about it, it will be unfair to the couple involved. Here is the need for the boundary. In order to administrate a church properly, there is the need to distinguish these boundaries.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN<br>THE ELDERS AND THE WORKERS</H2><P>The Bible shows us that the elders are appointed by the apostles. The apostles are the workers. But we must know clearly that not all the workers are apostles. If we consider it this way, it is very dangerous. It would be terrible if all it takes to become an apostle and therefore to be qualified to appoint elders is for a person to be a full-time worker. Hence, there is a difference between one worker and another. Some are commissioned, as the apostles were. Others may not have the apostolic commission. Therefore, there must also be a distinction in the relationship between the elders and the workers. With some workers, you can consider them as apostles and can take their leadership. Some other workers are young and are just learning to serve the Lord. They should still be under the leading of the elders. There is a further distinction of boundary here. If one is not clear about this boundary, there will also be confusion in the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN<br>THE ELDERS AND THEIR RELATIVES</H2><P>There is also a boundary between the elders and their relatives and even their family. Almost all the elders have a wife and children. Some elders have parents who are still living. With every family, there are relatives. The elders must know clearly the boundary between them and their relatives.</P><P>I have spoken of this matter on more than one occasion in the past. Whenever I have the opportunity, I will point out this matter. In some localities where some brothers function as elders, they also drag their wives in as elders. Some even drag their children and parents in as elders. For them, when a person becomes an elder, his whole family become elders. Perhaps you may say, "What are you talking about?" For instance, a certain Brother Chang may be functioning as an elder. One day after coming home from an elders' meeting, upon entering his door, his wife may ask him, "What was discussed at the elders' meeting today?" Brother Chang may say, "Oh, it was terrible! We talked about a divorce case!" Immediately, his son may ask, "Who is the brother?" The elder may reply, "It is Brother So-and-so." His daughter may continue, "Oh, then what will ever happen to his wife?" I tell you, within less than half an hour after the elders' meeting where the divorce case was discussed, Elder Chang's entire family are contributing their opinions about the case already. Before eight o'clock at night, when the son goes to the tutorial class, all the brothers in the son's class also know about it. Before the next morning, all the young brothers and sisters know about it. Perhaps Sister Chang would go to a sisters' meeting that evening. After the meeting, she would grab the sisters and say, "Sisters, we must all pray. How terrible! Brother So-and-so wants to divorce his wife!" Although they may all have good intentions in their hearts, they will stir up a storm and will make the situation a mess. For Brother Chang to do this is for him to make his whole family the elders. This will bring in an unbearable burden upon the church.</P><P>Brothers, suppose Brother Chang knows the boundary between the elders and their families. After the elders' meeting, when he goes home and his wife asks him about the elders' meeting, he can gently tell her: "You are not an elder; the elders' meeting is not a matter for you to take care of." This is to have the boundary. In order to manage the church well, this boundary must be clearly drawn. Otherwise, within a year, many rumors will abound in the church, and these rumors will all come from the elders.</P><P>I wish to say this before God with a good conscience; I have no intention to be critical. In some places, the situation is simply unbearable. On the one hand, in the overseeing service of the church, the sisters are strictly kept outside the door. Yet on the other hand, the elders who serve in the church bring all the matters of the church to their wives, to the extent that the wives are even interfering with the affairs of the church. This is absolutely an abnormal situation. I can say solemnly that there is no way for such a church to avoid confusion, because there is no clear boundary between the elders and their families.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE BOUNDARY OF TIMING</H2><P>The elders must also be able to discern the timing of events. Some things can be done at a certain time. But if the time is changed, the same things cannot be done any longer. Some words can be spoken in one kind of meeting, but in another meeting, such words cannot be released. You cannot say that because a matter is announced in the prayer meeting it can therefore be released in the preaching meeting as well. No. Here is a boundary of timing. In everything related to the elders, they have to maintain the boundary of timing. If a matter is not done at a certain time, it can no longer be done. You have to learn to consider the matter of timing. In order for the elders to manage a church well, they have to keep to the boundary of timing.</P><P>For instance, in the situation we just mentioned, that of a couple about to have a divorce, when the elders hear about it, they may want to visit them and to help them. But when should they do it? Please remember that the timing is very important. The elders must study whether the matter has become open yet, and whether they can visit the couple in a proper way. Perhaps they should wait for another week and should watch the development of events. If there is no adequate consideration of the boundary of timing, the couple may be damaged. They must draw clearly the boundary of time, so that when they go, it will be just the right time.</P><P>In everything, there is the consideration of timing. Even when a brother is sick, or has developed a problem with the church, or has been enticed by some sins, you cannot take a brother and visit him right away after you hear the news. You cannot do this. You have to consider the time factor. You must find out what the most suitable time is. For some things the right time has passed, and there is nothing that can be done any longer. You should not try to do anything, or else the result will be even worse. You can only ask for the Lord's forgiveness for your dullness, that you have not caught the proper time. Sometimes, it is not right to do anything yet; you have to wait for a few days, or a period of time, and watch the development or the result, before you can make any contact.</P><P>If an elder indeed has a heart to shepherd God's flock and to build up Christ's Body, he will see the importance of timing. It is like a physician who is preparing to operate on his patient; there is a question of timing involved. Any elder who cannot draw a boundary in the matter of timing will most certainly be unable to manage the church. Therefore, the elders must also consider the matter of timing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE BOUNDARY OF PLACE</H2><P>Not only is there a boundary of time, there is a boundary of place also. A boundary implies a distinction. The elders can do certain things in one place, but not in another. They can speak certain words in one setting, but not when the setting is changed. This is not being diplomatic; neither is it being deceitful. This is absolutely a distinction pertaining to a boundary.</P><P>Strictly speaking, only in the elders' meeting can the elders speak openly and freely, without reservation and without concealment, about things pertaining to the brothers and sisters, the church, and the testimony of the Lord. Other than this, all the elders have to consider all the boundaries and must draw a clear line across all the boundaries. The elders cannot share the things discussed in an elders' meeting with the deacons. They cannot discuss these things with the other brothers and sisters, much less with their families. Only in this way can the elders feel free to discuss the matters concerning the brothers and sisters in the elders' meeting. Otherwise, it would do injustice to the brothers and sisters. In the elders' meetings, anything related to the church and to the Lord's testimony can be discussed. But when the setting is changed and the place changed, the same things cannot be discussed. This is the consideration of place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE BOUNDARY OF BUSINESS AFFAIRS</H2><P>The elders must also recognize the boundary of business affairs. There are certain matters that the elders cannot touch. Once they touch them, they trespass the boundary. There are other matters which the elders must look into, because they are within the jurisdiction of the elders. I often receive letters from brothers and sisters out of town. When I read them, I felt that they surely have a good heart and are surely for the Lord, for His work, and even the more for His church. But the way the letters were written tells me that they really do not recognize any boundary. They mix all the relationships up together and do not have any clear-cut distinction. This would easily cause trouble in the church.</P><P>The church is something long-lasting. It does not exist today and disappear tomorrow. It does not appear for a while and then subside in an instant. The church will be here on earth all the time. If the Lord delays His return, perhaps she will still be here in fifty or eighty years' time. If a person becomes an elder at the age of forty or fifty, he will at least be an elder for another ten to twenty years. If you cannot distinguish the boundary of business affairs, in time all kinds of confusion will result. Therefore, you must constantly learn to draw a clear boundary line in all business affairs.</P><P>Please remember that the clearer you draw the boundary line, the more solid the church's unity and coordination will be. Only then will the building of the church be properly brought onto the right track. Because the elders have learned proper lessons in drawing the boundaries in time, place, and business, they will know whose business each matter is. Whenever certain things come to their attention, they can immediately say, "This is the brothers' business. Let us not touch it for now." Some other matters may come to the elders, and they can draw a clear line immediately, saying, "This is the sisters' business. Again, we should not touch it for now." Still, when other things come to the elders, they can quickly draw the line and say, "This has to do with the Lord's work; it has to do with the ministry," or, "This has to do with the co-workers." Only when you clearly draw the line in business affairs can you know what things are within the boundary of the elders. Only then will you be able to divide and to discern all things according to the boundary of the truth. You will be able to tell whether a matter has contradicted the truth or whether it is within the boundary of the truth. In this way, you will know whether or not you should touch a matter. Otherwise, you will always be doing what you should not do. All these things have to do with your understanding.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE CHURCHES</H2><P>There is also a boundary between the churches. True, all the local churches are in the Lord, and they should all fellowship with one another and do their best to help each other. But once a problem occurs, there is still the need to clearly draw the boundary. You must distinguish clearly whether a matter belongs to one local church or to another local church. Some elders are too good in their hearts. They feel that since they are not far from a church in their suburbs, they should help the other church, and they go ahead and make decisions for that church! This may be done out of a good heart, but often it damages matters. Do not consider this as unimportant. We must always learn to draw the boundary clearly. If this matter belongs to another church, even if it seems troublesome, we must still turn it over to them, informing their responsible ones of it and allowing them to take care of the matter. Although there should be fellowship between the churches and although they should help one another in the Lord, yet the boundary between the churches must be clear.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN<br>THE CHURCH AND THE WORK</H2><P>The boundary between the church and the work is a big subject. During the two thousand years of church history, there are two problems which have never been truly solved: one is the problem of receiving people, and the other is the relationship between the church and the work. How should we receive a person to be a brother? This problem still is not solved today. At the same time, the boundary between the church and the work is also a difficult problem; there are too many considerations involved, and it is difficult to distinguish them clearly.</P><P>However, if we return to the Scriptures without any personal subjective feeling or background of Christianity, and if we read the Word of God with a sober mind and an enlightened spirit, we will see that the boundary between the church and the work is very clear. On the one hand, the church encompasses everything; all the workers, including the apostle Paul, are in the church. When Paul went to Corinth, he was a brother in the church in Corinth. When he went to Ephesus, he was a brother in the church in Ephesus. When he went to Antioch, he was a brother in the church in Antioch. It was a different matter that he had a gift and could exercise and supply others. As a brother, he was a member of the church. Yet, on the other hand, as an apostle he was a worker, and he was responsible for a part of the Lord's work. As such, his standing was altogether beyond the jurisdiction of the church. Otherwise, if the workers and the work were completely under the church, it would become possible for the church to have workers and to send out workers and direct them, or to initiate a work. This would altogether be beyond the teaching of the Scriptures. Therefore, we can see that as a brother, a worker is in the church, but as one who is commissioned by the Lord, he is apart from the jurisdiction of the church.</P><P>On the one hand, all the work everywhere is for the church. The workers are either there to establish a church, or there to edify and build up the churches. On the other hand, all churches everywhere should submit to the Lord's work. The churches should pray for the work and supply and fellowship with the work in financial matters. But one thing must be very clear. All the work of outreach is absolutely and one hundred percent in the hand of the worker and not in the hand of any local church. Any local church can only be responsible for the work in its own locality. For instance, in a certain locality the gospel work, the work of edifying the saints, and the work of visitation and teaching are all the responsibility of the local church. All workers who go there to work should submit to that local church. But the work of outreach, of pioneering, does not belong to any local church. The church in Taipei cannot send a brother to the church in Shindien to edify the church there. The Lord has not given the church the ground to do such a work. Only the commissioned apostles and the Lord's workers have the ground to do such a work of outreach. Works of outreach are in the hands of the workers. This is the relationship between the church and the work. If we know this, we will have a clear boundary when dealing with certain matters. Only then can we say such a matter belongs to the church and such a matter belongs to the workers and the work.</P><P>Sometimes an elderly or a considerably experienced co-worker may come to your place. The elders must be clear whether or not he is coming simply as a brother. Whether or not he has a gift to exercise here, and whether or not he has the burden or the leading to work here is a different issue. It is a fact that the administration of a local church is still in the hands of the elders. No worker, no matter how experienced or spiritually advanced he is, can be a substitute for the elders to bear the responsibility of the church.</P><P>In some places, because the elders are not clear about this boundary, when an elderly co-worker comes to the church, they would quickly hand over all their responsibilities. It is as if they are saying, "You are older, and you know how to take the lead; please take up the responsibility of leadership." Please understand that this is not an accurate concept. The apostle Paul never acted in this way. None of the apostles have ever acted in this way. It is a different matter if an apostle has the Lord's leading and stays for a longer time in a needy place, and then he also becomes an elder in that local church. But he can never take over the responsibility of the church in the position of an apostle and in the qualification of a worker. He can at most put himself as one of the elders and coordinate with the other elders in the qualification of an elder to bear together the responsibility of that local church. If the elders can learn to understand this boundary, the church will surely receive a great benefit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN<br>THE CHURCH AND THE DENOMINATIONS</H2><P>The distinction between the church and the denominations is also a big subject. I will just say a frank word: in Christianity, there are a few things which can give us a headache. One such thing is the saying that all churches are more or less the same. In some places, even the elders in the church say such a thing. Whenever I hear this, I would say to these ones bluntly, "If they are more or less the same, why do you come here to be an elder?" They may say, "This is the Lord's leading, and it is the arrangement of the brothers. I cannot decline. But to me everything is more or less the same." Oh, brothers, an elder can never say "more or less the same"! If the answer is yes, say yes. If the answer is no, say no. Never say "more or less the same." If they are more or less the same, we should not be starting another group in addition to so many groups. The elders among us who bear responsibility in the various local churches must say that the difference is too great. What is a church, and what is a denomination? Here is a great boundary.</P><P>Some find it very hard to take such a word. When they hear it, they feel uncomfortable. But I want to say humbly to the brothers and sisters that all those who find it hard to hear such a word are those who suffer loss. If you cannot distinguish the church from the denominations, you yourself will be the first one to suffer. The suffering of the church will be secondary.</P><P>We can never acknowledge that any denomination is the church. We can only acknowledge that within those denominations there are our brothers and sisters, and people who are part of the church. They are elements of the church. They are members of the Body of Christ. But we cannot acknowledge that any denomination is the church. Otherwise, you will find it extremely difficult to take the lead in the church. I hope all the responsible brothers in all the local churches are clear about this matter. I also hope that no one who is confused about this matter will be appointed as an elder, because this will cause difficulty in the administration in the future. We can say that very many problems originate from this matter. In order to administrate the church, we must have a distinction here. Today, we can all distinguish the difference between the Catholic church and the Protestant churches, but we should not stop at this distinction only. We should distinguish also the difference between the various denominations and the churches that the Lord has established in each locality on earth. Either we do not talk about the administration of the church, or we must have a very clear boundary in this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. THE BOUNDARY OF THE TRUTH</H2><P>There is still another boundary we should know, the boundary of the truth. The matter of boundary is absolutely related to knowledge. The elders should have considerable knowledge regarding the truth. They must be able to draw a boundary on all truth. In this way, it will be very easy to find out the heresies and the wrong teachings.</P><P>The ones responsible for administration in the church do not necessarily need to use all the truth, but they need to know all the truth. It is like the pursuit of knowledge: some knowledge is for application, whereas other is to be used at some later date. The same is true with the understanding of the truth. What we use daily to supply the brothers and sisters and to apply in the church may only be a few very practical and spiritual items that are full of life; we may not need to use the other items in the same way. However, we still need to know about them, and we should keep them there for later use.</P><P>We know that nothing of what God has created is simple. Man is of course not simple, for he is composed of skin and flesh on the outside, and muscle and bone on the inside. In addition, there are the inward parts, the heart and the lungs, and many other parts. Even a watermelon is quite involved. When we eat a watermelon, we do not necessarily eat the whole thing. We do not eat the rind, we do not eat the seeds, and we do not eat the tissues in the meat. But the watermelon still needs these things. Without the seeds and the rind, the meat cannot grow. But what is useful is only the meat of the watermelon. The elders must know the truth in such a way. They must know the truth in all aspects. Although they will use only certain aspects of the truth, and will not use much of the other aspects, they should still keep them there. The latter will render a certain help and safeguard to our application. Therefore, all who administrate the church must know the truth in many aspects.</P><P>Classification is the prerequisite to the knowledge of any matter or to the truth. Regardless of what matter or truth we want to know, we must first classify it. You may not understand something at the beginning, but once you classify it, it will become clear. For instance, suppose a man gives a message today. How would you classify this message? Once you classify it, you will understand it. When you can really classify the truth, you will truly know whether or not a message is helpful to the brothers and sisters. You can also decide whether or not such a message can be accepted. Hence, this is absolutely related to the administration of the church.</P><P>If the elders cannot draw the line on the truth, the church will be put in jeopardy in receiving the supply of the ministry of the Word. Of course, with a small place like the one we have in Taiwan today, everyone is in fellowship with each other, and the situation is easier to handle. But in other places, it would be rather difficult. When everyone is separated one from another by great distances, and every place has to be responsible for itself, how should the church decide which ministry of the Word and which ministers of the Word it should take? This requires the elders to be able to draw the boundary concerning the truth. You cannot say, "Oh, since he is a preacher and what he says is based on the Scriptures, we can accept it." No. You must classify what he preaches and draw the boundary on it. You must ascertain the category his message comes under, and define its boundary. If you can draw the boundary and classify this way, you will be able to tell right away if the message is dangerous or helpful. This is a great safeguard to the church that you are administrating.</P><P>In some places, the condition of the church grieves me very much. The reason is that the responsible ones do not know how to draw the boundary in the truth and do not classify the truth. The church invites people to preach and teach in a loose way. The result is complete confusion, destruction, and division. These are big considerations in the administration of the elders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIL. THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN<br>THE BROTHERS AND THE SISTERS</H2><P>There is another boundary that needs to be strictly kept. That is the boundary between the brothers and the sisters. This is also a great boundary. There is one thing we must admit: while Christians live on earth today, the place where they have the most opportunity to contact the opposite sex is the church. Between the brothers and sisters, they meet in the meetings, in the service, in the gospel preaching, and in their witnessing work. For this reason, in their administration of the church, the elders must draw a boundary between the brothers and the sisters. This is not a boundary of separation, but a boundary of distinction. This boundary must never be removed or annulled. Whenever you annul this boundary, you will involve yourselves in immense trouble.</P><P>In Christianity there are some zealous ones with little spiritual experience who suggest: "We are all brothers and sisters in the Lord. Since we are all spiritual, we do not need to distinguish the brothers from the sisters." I want to tell the brothers and sisters that I have seen the fruit from such a concept. I have heard even more about such things. They bring untold problems to the church. In some places, it is the elders who are reaping and eating their own fruit because the elders themselves have led the church this way. Their way of administration is to cause the brothers and sisters not to have any boundary. This is altogether wrong.</P><P>While we live on this earth and in our flesh, in no way can you believe that the boundary between men and women can be abolished; there is no such thing. This is the devil's teaching. In some places, some teach that we are all spiritual, and that to talk about the boundary between male and female is to have defiled thoughts. Some almost condemn me by saying that it is because my thoughts are filthy and unclean that I am talking about the boundary between the brothers and the sisters. No. Even if thousands of people would rise up to say that my thoughts are unclean, I will still stand up to tell you that you need a boundary between the brothers and the sisters. The elders in every locality must set up a firm boundary between the brothers and the sisters; they should never remove it.</P><P>Galatians 3 says that in Christ there is no more distinction between male and female. But in 1 Corinthian 11 and 14, it says that in the church we must still distinguish the boundary between male and female. There is no distinction between male and female in Christ, but there is still the distinction between male and female in the church. If in the church we make no distinction between male and female, then Paul is actually contradicting himself in 1 Corinthians 11 and 14, because there he clearly says that brothers do not have to cover their heads when they pray, but that the sisters do. In addition, the sisters should not speak in the meeting. You can see that there is still a distinction between male and female in the church.</P><P>Some have checked with me in a serious way: "Brother Lee, why does the church not come up to the standard of the age? In most social gatherings today, men and women sit together. Why do the men and women sit separately in the church meetings?" Dear brothers and sisters, you cannot deny that David loved the Lord more than you do and was more spiritual than you are. But even David could fall. How much more can we fall also? Today, we are still in the old creation, and it is still possible for us to fall. God has not removed the boundary between male and female in the church. When you and I administrate the church, we must not give the impression that we are all in the Lord and that it makes no difference whether we are brothers or sisters. This indifference is detrimental and must never be permitted. We must learn to draw a boundary here.</P><P>Now I have presented to you these twelve boundaries. If the elders know how to draw these boundaries, their administration of the church will be stable, clear, and proper. You will be able to bring all kinds of people and things onto the right track. In this way, the church will have the real administration and building.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE ELDERS</H1><P>First, we shall speak something concerning the matter of fellowship. If we know the principle of God's work, we will see clearly that a basic principle for God to bestow grace is fellowship. Whether it is God's salvation of man, or His edification or raising up of a man, He does it in the principle of fellowship. Rarely can you find an example where God does a work of grace for man apart from the principle of fellowship. You cannot find a person who is saved by God directly. Although every person receives his salvation from God, he receives it indirectly, at least through one person. This receiving through man speaks of a principle of fellowship.</P><P>If you read the history of the church or the autobiographies of spiritual men, you can find that the same is true in God's calling of men. On the one hand, you can say that God calls men directly, but within this calling there is always the element of fellowship. The called one always has some contact first with those who are serving the Lord. This contact is the fellowship, and it becomes a factor for that person to be called by God. Even God's edification, His raising up and equipping of a person, and His giving of gifts to us are bound up with the principle of fellowship. The apostle Paul told Timothy in his letter that the gift Timothy received came from the laying on of hands of Paul and the elders. This is fully a matter of fellowship. Timothy received the gift because of the fellowship and through the fellowship. In God's administration of grace, there is a very basic principle, which is fellowship. Where there is no fellowship, grace stops. Where there is no fellowship, the flow of the Holy Spirit is cut off. Fellowship is a great principle.</P><P>Hence, if the elders want to bring the management of a church up to a strong, shining, fresh, and rich condition, they must be persons of fellowship. If the elders in any place lack fellowship, they will surely be in darkness, dryness, weakness, and mistakes. Without fellowship, there is no balance. Without fellowship, you will surely dry up, and when you are dried up, you will be poor and weak. Moreover, when there is no balance, you will be biased, and you will be stuck in minor matters, or will go to an extreme. This is unavoidable. If the elders will take every opportunity to fellowship, they will surely be nourishing, rich, shining, fresh, and balanced. They will not be dry and will not be driven to extremes. Hence, in speaking about the elders' administration, we cannot talk about the coordination of the elders without talking about their fellowship.</P><P>During these years, the brothers in all the places have realized the need of coordination for the management of the elders. Nevertheless, their feeling for the need of fellowship is not strong enough. I wish that the elders in every locality would have a strong feeling from now on that in order to be an elder there is the need for fellowship. If there is no fellowship, they will not be proper elders. Not only in spiritual matters, but in the worldly matters also, there is the need for fellowship with those outside your own sphere. This is why there is the need to have cultural exchanges and scientific exchanges. If you try to close your door and be a reclusive person, in the end you will have only a very narrow view; you will know only a limited amount. Others may have advanced in many ways already, but you are still dragging the oxcart and are still quite contented. Today, in politics, military developments, finance, science, and many forms of literature, there is the need for exchanges. Once there is an exchange, there are the riches. You do not necessarily only receive from others; in receiving something from others, you also supply others as well. Fellowship is one of the great principles in the universe. This principle is of God and is ordained by God.</P><P>Fellowship is all the more indispensable in the Body of Christ. This can be clearly seen when we look at the human body. The body is fully a matter of fellowship. Whenever the body lacks fellowship and the blood stops circulating, the person is finished. We know that exercise increases the circulation of the blood. In other words, it increases the fellowship. All the sicknesses of the body are dealt with through the fellowship of the blood circulation; all the supply is received through the fellowship of the blood circulation. In the same principle, in the Body of Christ and in the church, all the problems are solved through fellowship, and all the supply is received through the fellowship. For the elders to manage the church, they cannot depart from the principle of fellowship at all. If they do, they will immediately suffer great loss.</P><P>In some localities, although the elders have never said that they do not need fellowship, what they do and the way they act is telling others that they do not need fellowship. Such churches are all in a condition of dryness and deadness many times. In the church and in the Body of Christ, there is such a thing called fellowship. Whether you like it or not, you have to fellowship. All those who think they can manage by themselves and can do without fellowship are most foolish and proud. No matter how fat and strong a tree is, it needs water for irrigation. Otherwise, it will wilt and die. Even if we were to become as rich as Paul, we could not do without fellowship. I hope the elders would have this strong feeling. Now let us consider the persons to fellowship with.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</H2><P>The first one with whom the elders should have fellowship is God. All of the elders must be those who have fellowship with God. If their fellowship with God is cut off, they should not be elders any longer. Not only should the elders have fellowship with God, but they must also bring all the matters that fall into their hands to God and fellowship with God about these things. While the elders are bearing the responsibilities of the church, they should bring all the matters within their responsibility to God and fellowship with God about them. They should bring all the responsibilities, all the matters, and all the problems before God and fellowship with God about them. Not only should the elders themselves live in fellowship all the time and have dealings before God, but in serving together as elders, when they are confronted with problems in the church which require their handling, their solving, or their facilitating, they need to bring these matters corporately before God and have fellowship with God. They have to deal with them like a business, and they should ask God, "Can this be done? Is this right? How should we do it?" They must fellowship thoroughly with God in everything before they act. The elders must never cut off their fellowship with God. Any decision made apart from fellowship is wrong. All the management in the church, all the decisions, work, promotions, and leading in the church, and everything that passes through the hands of the elders must be brought before God and carried out through fellowship with God. Individually, the elders should have fellowship with God, and, as a whole, every time a decision is made or a matter promoted, the elders must first fellowship with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. FELLOWSHIP AMONG THE ELDERS</H2><P>The elders must also fellowship with each other. This mutual fellowship must be a one-hundred percent, undiscounted fellowship. In the chapter on coordination, we have mentioned that to coordinate together, there must be openness. This openness is the fellowship. When we serve as elders together, you cannot fellowship only ninety percent, while holding back ten percent. Anything that is held back will cause problems. When the elders serve together, they must fellowship to such an extent that not one brother is holding back anything from the other elders.</P><P>I want to tell the brothers and sisters that the guidance and burden of the elders comes from their fellowship. Likewise, their handling of matters and their solutions to problems come out of fellowship. The elders' ability, light, and foresight also come out of fellowship. Even the elders' management comes out of fellowship. Where the elders hold back a little, reserve a little, or close themselves up a little, there the wisdom and light are lacking a little. Any time you detect something or see something, you have to fellowship the matter over with the elders one hundred percent, fully, and completely. If you do not do this, the management of the elders will never be carried out properly.</P><P>In order to manage a church, the elders must have thorough fellowship. If there are five elders, they are like five lumps of clay. They must be mingled together in water until the five lumps become one lump, and they become indistinguishable one from another. This mingling is the fellowship. The five elders should be seeking the Lord's leading together. The thing to fear in the management of the church is not the ignorance of the elders in handling affairs, but their unwillingness to fellowship. If the five brothers are willing to be mingled together and are willing to fellowship together, morning and evening, today, tomorrow, and every day, you will see the Lord's leading there, and you will see God's way, God's wisdom, light, revelation, and burden all there. Through the fellowship, the burden for the gospel will come, the burden to edify the saints will come, the light from the Bible will come, and the gifts will also come. If the elders are willing to fellowship this way, at the right time some will receive the gifts.</P><P>I can guarantee all of you here that the best way to be a proper elder is to fellowship every day. Perhaps you may say that you do not have much to fellowship about. It is precisely because of this that you need to come together for fellowship. Suppose you would simply come together to talk, then pray, then talk again, about your problems, my problems, your condition before God, and my condition before God. After you have talked through everything about yourselves as the elders, you would talk about the condition of the brothers and sisters, the condition of the church, the number of sinners in your place, and the way to preach the gospel. If the elders would fellowship this way, something will surely come out of this kind of fellowship.</P><P>The worse thing that can happen is for these five elders to meet together but once a week, while on other occasions they merely shake hands, nod their heads, exchange greetings, and talk about the weather. Whenever there is a meeting, they would come together. After the meeting, they would say good-by to one another. Everything is done merely to maintain outward harmony. Actually, they hide everything and close themselves to the others. Even their prayers issue merely from their throats. If this is the case with the elders, they will not receive guidance a single time from the beginning of the year to the end; they will not have any burden or any light.</P><P>In order for the elders to have the light, the guidance, the wisdom, and the dealings, they must be together daily. Whenever they can, they must come together without too much regard for time. Perhaps they need to fellowship from seven in the evening until midnight, and perhaps they need to come together again for fellowship the next day. If you can fellowship in this manner for a whole month without any results&#151;I will put it crudely&#151;you can then come to cut off my head! Surely the burden will come, and the guidance, the light, the wisdom, the power, and the authority will all come. By that time if you suggest at the meeting that we should preach the gospel, everyone would respond. This is quite amazing. If you have not fellowshipped this way, and you propose, "Well, we have not preached the gospel for three years already. We really need to preach the gospel." While you are making the proposal, others may be dozing off; there will be no response. This is a lifeless proposal; it is not a living proposal, because you as an elder are not quickened within. While you are making the proposal, you are pouring cold water on the others; there is no way for you to warm the others up. Suppose the elders are first enlivened by the fellowship and are burning within, and they feel that in two weeks they should preach the gospel. When they speak to the brothers, the word will become living; there will be authority in the word, and the Holy Spirit will put His seal upon it. When others listen to it, they will feel the power and authority of the Holy Spirit in the word. This is not negotiation or a decision, but a fellowship.</P><P>More than ten years ago when we were serving the Lord in northern China, every Monday from 8 a.m. until 2 or 3 p.m., for six or seven hours, over ten of the elders and leading brothers and sisters would always come together for fellowship. We fellowshipped about the brothers and sisters, the matters related to the church, the Lord's table meeting the night before, or the gospel meeting on the Lord's Day. That was not superficial fellowship, but serious fellowship. Sometimes the sisters would mention the names of quite a number of sisters, stating their condition. They might mention that a certain sister had much progress and much function, that she might even have some gifts. However, she seemed to lack something, and there seemed to be the need for someone to come in to fill up that lack. Some would bring out some problems, and some would bring out some lacks. The extent of fellowship was quite broad, and hence the time quite long. It was through that kind of fellowship that the church in that place became alive, and the responsible ones became transparent.</P><P>By 1943, the church in that place had a great revival. We then felt that it was not enough to fellowship once a week, but that we must hold meetings every evening and gather for fellowship each afternoon. At those fellowship meetings we always discussed such things as the direction of the flow of the Holy Spirit, the manner in which different ones had a spiritual turn, the meeting the night before, the feeling for the meeting that evening, and the persons we must look for and contact. That fellowship was truly living. Up to a certain point, a brother would suggest that we contact a certain brother again. Another one might feel that the time was not yet ripe, and that we should wait. After such a fellowship, when we went out to visit again, we truly saw the Lord's blessing. All these things came from the fellowship. If the elders can fellowship continually, there is no way for the church in that place to fail to be revived. There is no need to ask for the apostles' or the workers' help any longer. As long as the elders would fellowship from morning till evening, and from evening till morning for thirty days in a row, the church will surely be revived. Please pardon me for saying what I am saying. I know what I am talking about. Wherever such fellowship is lacking, it will be difficult for the Holy Spirit to do His work.</P><P>For this reason, I hope that the brothers would not discuss business as the first thing, but would open themselves up first for fellowship. It is one thing to discuss, and it is another thing to fellowship. When the elders come together to discuss matters, I do know that sometimes everyone is closed. In the end, although there is a conclusion, there is no fellowship among the brothers. Strictly speaking, all the decisions should come out of fellowship.</P><P>There is very much to the matter of fellowship. When the brothers come together for fellowship, the Holy Spirit will operate among us apart from our consciousness, and everyone will see his own failure, weakness, or shortcomings. Each one will see his unfaithfulness towards the church, and his shortage in learning the lessons before the Lord. If everyone would fellowship his condition before everyone else, let me repeat, some gifts will come out in this way. Through this kind of fellowship, some will receive the ministry of the Word. Others will receive the gift of healing. I surely know that through this kind of fellowship, the minds of some people are turned around. From that day on, they become an opened person; they become wise, and everything presented to them is judged in a wise way. This wisdom, according to 1 Corinthians 12, comes out of fellowship.</P><P>Therefore, I would like the brothers to go to try this. In order for the responsibility of the elders to be strengthened in your place, not only do you have to fellowship with God individually, and not only do you have to bring the corporate matters before the Lord and fellowship thoroughly over them, but more important than these things, the elders themselves have to fellowship one with another. The few of you have to be like lumps of clay that are mingled as one lump; there should be no way for you to be separated from one another any longer. When a few brothers fellowship together and are mingled as one, the guidance will come, and so will the light, the burden, the revelation, the authority, the power, and the wisdom. This is truly the case.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. FELLOWSHIP WITH THE DEACONS</H2><P>In the church, in addition to the elders, there are some serving ones, who are the deacons. For example, in Taipei there are the responsible ones for the districts, the business-office serving ones, the group-meeting responsible ones, those who are responsible for visitation, for cleaning, for chair and hall arranging, for ushering, and for clerical work. With all these serving ones, the elders need to maintain continual fellowship. This is why I said that the elders should spend all their time with these positive things and should not spend too much time to do what the deacons should do. Never think that if the elders do not watch over the arrangement of chairs and the hall, they will have nothing more to do. No. There are too many things that they should do. They need to visit and to fellowship with the serving ones. The elders have to fellowship with the serving ones individually one by one. The fellowship needs to be thorough, and they need to do this again and again. If they would do this, there will be many great results.</P><P>Do not say that the deacons are doing a good job already, that some are taking care of the windows, the floors, and the chairs, and some are responsible for the ushering already, and that things are more or less all right. No. They are not all right. It is like a pot of flowers that is growing. If you give it fertilizer regularly and water it every day, it will grow in one kind of way. If you do not give it fertilizer and do not water it, it can still barely survive, but the appearance will be different. In order for the church service to be full of life, with few problems, and with much perfecting of people that takes them onward and upward, there is the need for the elders to have continual fellowship with the serving ones. I cannot relate to you all the things involved in this kind of fellowship. But when you practice it, you will see the amount of blessing it brings.</P><P>Some elders feel that when the church is divided into districts and all the meetings are handed over to the district responsible ones, the elders will be out of a job. It is true that if the elders do not take the proper way of eldership and are still serving as elders in a natural way, the day will come when the church becomes too big and the districts so large that they are divided, and they will find themselves out of a job. But if you would learn and would not serve as an elder in the natural way, but would serve as an elder under the Lord's leading, you will see that there are too many things to do. It is true that the work is handed over to the district responsible ones. But you have to fellowship with them to see how these responsible ones are doing. In Taipei there are over thirty districts, with about 160 to 170 district responsible ones. It is a tedious job for the elders to fellowship thoroughly with these ones. How great a responsibility this is! Yet how great is this blessing! Suppose the ten elders can fellowship thoroughly with these 160 to 170 district responsible ones, and they can maintain a regular fellowship with them. How great an achievement that will be! Yet how glorious it will be also!</P><P>For example, here are two elders who are particularly good at administration. The two of them should coordinate together to fellowship with the responsible ones of the thirty-five districts on administration alone. Perhaps one or two among the elders are particularly good at helping others to read the Bible. They should go out to fellowship with the responsible ones of the thirty-five districts concerning Bible study alone, until all the 160 or 170 are able to lead others in their districts to have Bible study. Perhaps one or two among the elders have learned some particular lessons in fellowship and prayer. They should then fellowship with these 160 to 170 on how to live before the Lord. Perhaps one or two among the elders are good at preaching the gospel. They should concentrate on blowing the gospel trumpet, and they should fellowship with the responsible ones in these thirty-five districts the matter of gospel preaching. Brothers, please imagine how beautiful the result would be! The result of this fellowship will bring all the riches of the elders into the district meetings.</P><P>Not only should the elders fellowship with the serving ones; they have to find out what the result of this fellowship is. For example, after the elders who are good at administration have fellowshipped about administration, they should go back to see how the others have practiced administration. They may want to supply them a little more. In the end, they will find that the others can go on much better than they can. By that time, they have to come back to learn from the others. If you would study and investigate in this way, there will be no limit to the administration of the church.</P><P>I often condemn myself for one thing: in front of my house is a neglected little garden. I never water, fertilize, or trim the plants. Occasionally, someone would say that my garden looks good, and all is well. My answer would be: "True, nothing is dead yet; everything is still alive." But look, those plants that should have grown up have not grown up, and those that should have blossomed have not blossomed. If I could water them, fertilize them, and trim them, and if I could move the pots around a little, sometimes under the rain, sometimes under the sun, and sometimes with the dew, I am sure that the flowers would grow even better. A person as lazy as I am concerning flowers, who plants the flowers there but who never moves them a bit year round, can only find the flowers half-dead; there is no way I can make them look good.</P><P>This is the condition that some churches are in. The elders in those places think there is nothing to do. If a person has to be busy all day long simply to take care of a garden, and if even by doing that, the work cannot be finished, how much more work is there in the church? Oh, there are too many things to do in the church. There are so many of God's children there. If the elders would pick up the burden to fellowship with them, they will find too many people to guide, to contact, to open up, to lead, to raise up, and to perfect. This is why I say again, the elders have to fellowship with God, with each other, and with the other serving ones. Only then will the church be managed in a proper way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. FELLOWSHIP WITH THE SAINTS</H2><P>The elders should also do their best to contact and fellowship with all of the brothers and sisters. They should fellowship with the solid ones, and they should fellowship with the backslidden ones. They should fellowship with the weak ones, and they should fellowship with the strong ones. They should fellowship with the ones who are not gifted, and they should fellowship with the gifted ones. An elder has too many things to do. Some sisters who are sitting here are housewives. Everyone knows that in a family, no matter how many children there are, there is no end to the chores. You can leave your house alone day after day, or you can put work into it day after day. The same is true with the church. You can leave it to desolation, and let it grow by itself. The elders can come once a week to discuss a little, make some decisions, and then make some announcements in the prayer meetings. You can do this. But if you want to be another kind of elder, you will see that every day there are burdens, and every day you can be so busy. If the elders have a lot of free time, it will surely mean that the church in that place has no blessing. The more blessing there is, the more the church will be busy, like a marketplace. If you make a brother alive, imagine how many people he can bring into the church life! If you do not want to be busy, you can make the church dead. One will be cold, another will be backslidden. A third will be dried up, and a fourth will be dead. In the end, only you will be left, and you will not be busy at all. If you want to bring in the blessing, you will see that every day you are busy.</P><P>Brothers, I do not encourage others to lightly give up their occupations to serve the Lord full-time. But I want to tell the brothers and sisters that if all of you here would receive the burden to work for the Lord this way, even if every one of us would become full-time, we would still not meet the needs. If you make one brother alive, he will bring in three or five. If you make these ones alive, they may bring in twenty. Please consider, how can you handle this work?</P><P>Some have come to me for fellowship concerning the matter of serving full-time. They said that they have the heart and the burden, but they did not see the need. I told them that if they did not see the need, they did not have to force themselves to make the decision. But within me I said to myself that whether or not there is a need depends fully on yourself. If you work towards it, there will be a need. If you do not work, there will be no need. I believe the brothers and sisters understand what I mean. Try to work this way and see. If you serve the Lord by this way of fellowship, not only will one person be inadequate; even ten persons will not be adequate to meet today's need. When you get through with every brother and sister, eventually, not only will they be raised up, but you will find out the feeling of the saints and will know where their needs are. The case of every brother and sister is thoroughly worked on by the elders. In this way, when the elders come together for fellowship, the sense will come and the leading will come; everyone will know what to do about the church. The elders' leading and arrangement of the church is surely produced by this kind of fellowship. If the elders do not fellowship with each other, nor with the serving ones, and if they lack the fellowship with the brothers and sisters, it will be useless to have an elders' meeting once in a while.</P><P>Hence, in order to receive guidance, the elders have to fellowship with God, with each other, with the serving ones, and with all of the saints as well. Only after the fellowship in these few aspects becomes thorough should they come together to seek God's guidance. This is the principle of the judgment of the breastplate by the priests. The elders must bring all of God's people before Him before they can receive God's guidance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. FELLOWSHIP WITH ALL THE CHURCHES</H2><P>Although the churches in all the localities are administered locally, and although the authority of oversight and administration is vested in the hands of the local elders, in their normal condition the elders should do their best to fellowship with all the other places. Taipei should fellowship with New York, Tokyo, Manila, Singapore, London, France, and Tainan. If the elders can do this, they will find that the benefits fellowship brings are very great. Your view will be expanded, and your isolation will be balanced. If you are better than others already, your fellowship will make you even better. You will receive a boost from the other places, and your time will not be wasted. Do not say that you have no time, and that as an elder in Taipei, already you do not have enough time to take care of the problems in Taipei, let alone take care of the fellowship with other places. Please remember, however, that if you do not have this fellowship, you will surely suffer. Hence, no matter how busy you are, you have to fellowship.</P><P>Sometimes it is good even to have some ordinary fellowship. For example, you can write to another church to tell them about the blessings you have, or about your weaknesses, with the hope that they can render some help. This is also good fellowship. Sometimes when problems arise, they cannot be solved locally. At such times, you can write to the brothers in other localities and tell them that there is such a problem and ask for their feeling. You can ask if they have encountered similar problems in the past. Sometimes you can fellowship a little in the matter of burden for prayer; you can tell the others the items that need prayer. Sometimes you can share a little concerning the light you have received. These are all excellent things to do, and they can render tremendous help to all the places.</P><P>The last time I went to the Philippines, the heaviest burden I felt was that the churches in Southeast Asia have suffered greatly because of the lack of fellowship with the churches in China for a long time. Thank the Lord that during these years, there is some recovery, but it is still far from enough. Some unnecessary news spreads very fast, yet the necessary fellowship is very lacking. Some have a wrong concept about The News of the Churches; they think that to write something there is to make a display of themselves. I think that those who think this way should condemn themselves first. Whether or not you are making a display of yourself is absolutely a matter of your intention. But whether or not you are making a display of yourself, one thing is certain: you need others' fellowship, and others need to fellowship with you. You cannot do without this.</P><P>Brothers, the apostle Paul did expose himself considerably. Particularly in 2 Corinthians, he opened up himself completely without any reservation. If he had closed himself up, how much would the churches throughout the ages have suffered! For this reason we have to do our best to open up ourselves. If you want to condemn yourselves for making a display of yourself, you can do that. But you have to see that at the same time you need your brothers' supply, and your brothers need your supply. If the brothers from Shilin had closed themselves up, where would the church in Shilin be today? If Peitou had cut itself off completely from outside influence, would there be a church in Peitou today? We have to admit that we are living a life of fellowshipping with others. We are living under the shade of the umbrella of others; we are carried along by others' current. We cannot be proud, and we cannot be foolish.</P><P>The church is the Body of Christ, and all of us have to learn not to lose any blessing from any part of the Body. We must be willing to live in the Body and receive the supply from it. The elders in every locality should have this Body- consciousness. They must learn to fellowship with the churches in all the localities. They must supply others, and they must receive the supply from others. Even when others are lower, weaker, and poorer than you are, when you fellowship with them, you will discover that you can still be helped by the weak and supplied by the poor.</P><P>The Lord's children should see that fellowship is a great need here. I must say solemnly that the reason many local churches cannot go on today is that they lack fellowship with the other churches. It is an extremely valuable thing for you to try your best to fellowship with the churches in the other localities. This will not only supply the churches in the other places, but it will supply you yourself and your church. Of course, this requires that our heart be broad and our view be large. We have to see something universal, and we have to take care of the needs in all the places.</P><P>Of course, there is much to consider about the fellowship between the churches. You cannot write a letter of recommendation in a loose way. There must be many boundaries. Concerning some things, you can fellowship with one place but not with another place. Concerning some other things, you can fellowship about them now but not later. There is the boundary in time, and there is the boundary in place. There are also some things which you cannot fellowship with another locality at all. You have to learn all these lessons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. FELLOWSHIP WITH THE WORKERS</H2><P>The elders should also do their best to have fellowship with the workers whom the Lord uses. Although the churches in the localities are independent before the Lord, they have to maintain continual fellowship with the workers. This is also a very blessed thing to do.</P><P>In order to fellowship with God, there are many things to learn. In order to fellowship with each other, there are also many things to learn. For everything, you have to learn. How can the church in a place profit from the workers with whom it has fellowship? How can the workers receive help from the church? All these require much learning. The fellowship between the elders and the workers is a great lesson to learn.</P><P>We have to know that someone who has received an elementary school education is better than an illiterate one, and someone who has graduated from junior high school is better than one who has only graduated from the elementary school. Someone who has graduated from high school is better than one who has graduated from junior high school, someone who has gone to college is better than one who has graduated only from high school, and someone who is studying in graduate school is better than one who is in college. Although you can live whether or not you study, the way you live is different. If an elder learns the lessons, he can be an elder. If he does not learn the lessons, he can still be an elder. However, the problem is that the kind of elder he is will determine the kind of church he leads. Those who have learned the lessons lead the church on in one way, and those who have not learned the lessons lead the church in another way. If we want to have real management and building in the church, we have to learn many lessons properly. No carpenter could saw, cut, and chop from the day he was born; he has to practice daily. Those who are natural do things in one way, and those who have been trained do things another way. For this reason, the elders must practice and must learn.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ELEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><P>Today we need to consider another important subject. It is the most central lesson in the elders' overseeing of the church. This lesson is the administration of the church.</P><P>The administration of the elders is the overseeing, the management, the building, and the leadership of the elders. The elders' oversight, administration, building, leadership, and management of the church all refer to the same thing. However, in this lesson, we prefer to use the word administration.</P><P>There is much to say concerning the elders' administration of the church. If we think that administration only signifies the building up of the saints, we will only think in terms of the building and will not realize that it also includes the management of the church. Conversely, if we think that administration only covers the matter of management, we will not realize that it also includes the building up of the saints. But if we say administration, everything is included in a general way. Within administration there is both management and building; it includes everything. The words leadership, building, and management each refer to only one thing respectively. But the word administration immediately conveys the idea of manifold responsibilities. This is why we like to use the word administration. The elders' administration of the church is in many areas. In the terms of the secular world, it has many departments.</P><P>There is one goal in the elders' administration, with three areas of service. There are also various matters of coordination that have to be considered. Let us now consider them one by one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. ONE GOAL WITH THREE AREAS OF SERVICE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The One Goal</H2><P>Regardless where the church appears on this earth, it has only one goal: to be a testimony of Christ and to express Christ among humanity. When Christ is lived out and expressed through His people, there is the testimony of the church. This is the goal for which the church exists on earth today. The reason God wants to have a church in the universe is for it to express Christ in this way. The reason God establishes churches in all the localities is that Christ may be expressed by the saints in these localities. This is the goal of the church. It is also the goal of the elders' administration of the church.</P><P>The elders must realize that our meeting here does not represent any particular truth or any Christianity movement. Among all the organizations in Christianity, some represent the truth of baptism; they label themselves the Baptist Church. Others represent a Pentecostal movement; they call themselves the Pentecostals. But brothers, we have none of these intentions here. Rather, by the Lord's mercy, we desire to recover the testimony of the church on earth. We only wish that God would have more mercy on us and recover the testimony of the church so that the Son of God, our glorious Christ, will be expressed. The churches in all the places should maintain one testimony and emphasize one goal, which is that Christ be lived out and expressed among the brothers and sisters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Three Areas of Service</H2><P>From our past experiences and our knowledge concerning the truth in the Scripture, we have found clearly through our practice that the practical service in the church is in three areas:</P><P>The first is the zealous preaching of the gospel. In order for the church on earth to express the Son of God, it cannot neglect the preaching of the gospel. The church must preach the gospel of the Son of God to the sinners in darkness. If the testimony of the church is to be strengthened and built up, there must be the preaching of the gospel to bring in new souls. In the service of the gospel, the church must be zealous, powerful, and effective.</P><P>The second thing is to perfect the saints. When people are saved and are brought into the church, they must begin to be perfected right away. Of course, perfecting includes many things. It includes such things as helping them to love the Lord, to deal with their past, to consecrate themselves before the Lord, to learn to study the Bible, to pray, to contact the Lord, and to pursue in life. These are the four levels of spiritual life in which we have been trained in the past.</P><P>The third thing is service. Not only do we have to perfect the saved ones; we have to lead these saved and perfected ones into the church and have them serve in a practical way.</P><P>When these three items are added together, there is the building up of the church. On the one hand, there is the preaching of the gospel. On the other hand, there is the perfecting of the saints. Then you need to bring the saved and perfected ones together to serve. In this way, the church can be built up in a locality. Through the building up of these three areas of service, God's glorious goal is achieved, and Christ is expressed. This is the testimony of the church. It is God's goal concerning the church.</P><P>All the elders' administration and oversight of the church revolve around this one goal and three areas of service. This is the sphere of the elders' administration. Whatever the elders do, and no matter how much they do, in the end all the things are either for the gospel, for the perfecting, or for the service. These three items combined together produce the building, the attainment of which accomplishes God's goal.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. COORDINATION IN SERVICE</H2><P>The oversight and administration of the elders are nothing other than the gospel, the perfecting, and the service. Following the gospel, there is the perfecting, and following the perfecting, there is the service. As to the service, it must be done in coordination. The one thing that requires the most spiritual consideration in service is the matter of coordination. The oversight and administration of the elders must be carried out in coordination. If they cannot be carried out in coordination, the elders' administration will surely be weak. We have to realize that if the Lord is to gain the goal in the church in this age, the saints must be built up together. This building up is the coordination. The gospel brings in the saved sinners. When a person is saved, he needs to be perfected. After being perfected, he needs to serve. However, he must not serve individually, but serve in coordination. This is the coordination in service. It is the building up of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE ASPECTS OF COORDINATION</H2><P>Some people have taken our use of the word coordination to mean the organization of institutions. Actually, the two things are very different. The word "organization" is not found in the Bible, but the word "coordination" is found in the Chinese Version of the Bible. The Chinese translation of 1 Corinthians 12:24 is, "God coordinated the body together." From this verse we derived the word "coordination." The Body is coordinated together by God. You can say that the Body is an organization, because it is organized together by the different parts. But God says that this Body is a matter of coordination. Romans 12:5 says: "So we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another." Being members one of another to become one Body is a matter of coordination. Now let us consider the various aspects of coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Having Life</H2><P>The elders have to consider seriously everyone who wants to come into the coordination to see if each one has life. In common terms, we should find out if such a one is saved or not. Here, however, we are not emphasizing the matter of salvation, but the matter of life. Today, Christianity has spoiled the term salvation. It seems that salvation has come to mean only the forgiveness of sins, the deliverance from perdition, and a passage to heaven after you die. But the elders' administration of the church is toward the goal of coordination. For this reason the elders cannot pay attention simply to an incomplete salvation. Instead, they should pay attention to whether or not a person has life. If the goal is merely salvation, there would be no need of administration, oversight, or coordination. Since everyone will go to heaven anyway, why does the church still need oversight? Why is there still the need for coordination? Hence, in order to administrate the church, you must take life as the foundation. The first consideration is that you must have life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Living</H2><P>It is one thing to have life; it is another thing to be living. Experience tells us that many who have life do not appear to be living. You cannot say that such a person is not saved, but he is dead. At least, he is asleep; he is not yet awake.</P><P>To have life is the same as what Christianity calls being saved, and to be living is equivalent to what Christianity calls being revived. Some are saved, but they are not revived yet. They know definitely that they have sinned, and they have definitely believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior who has died for them on the cross. They definitely believe in the blood of the Lord Jesus and know that the Lord has forgiven them. They have relinquished their gross and immoral sins, and they are coming regularly to attend church meetings. However, they do not like to read the Bible, and they do not open their mouths to pray. They have no big sins, but neither have they cut themselves off from the small sins. They do not know anything about the world and have no concept about giving it up. They still live in their human relationships and worldly connections. They are saved, but they have never been revived.</P><P>On the other hand, we see some who are not only saved, but are revived. They love the Lord, desire after Him, study the Bible, and pray. They do not commit gross sins. When they commit a small sin, such as saying something wrong, they deal with it before the Lord. They have given up the world, and they are living a life for the Lord. They have come alive. They are living. Once you touch them, you can tell that they are awakened people. To be revived is to wake up. They always pray for others' souls with tears. After two months, such a one brings one person to salvation. In another three months, he brings another two to be saved. He is living.</P><P>Elders, please excuse me for saying these things. You have to realize that this is hard work for you. The elders should never say that there is nothing to do. There are so many brothers here. How many of them are living? Those who are not living are the ones you have to work with. You have to enliven them. This is the administration of the elders. All those who are not living need you to work with them.</P><P>Sometimes the elders may decide that their meeting place is not large enough and that they will buy a piece of land and build their own meeting hall on it. Everyone may think that this is too difficult, but I will tell the brothers and sisters that this is quite easy. The difficult part is to make the brothers and sisters who have life but who are not living to become quite living. You do not realize how much labor and endeavoring is needed there.</P><P>Here you need to take out the files of the brothers and sisters and read them carefully. Sometimes you should not read them alone, but with the other responsible ones from the district. Sometimes you have to fellowship with the brothers and sisters directly to touch their real inward condition. After you have touched their real condition, you can classify them. The living ones will belong to one category. The dead ones will belong to another category. Those who are half-dead are also put into a third category. During these days, I have been conducting this training. Sometimes I have to stay up until midnight to prepare these lessons. The next morning I have to rise up early again. Someone has told me that I am too tired. But I will tell the brothers and sisters that if I were to serve as an elder in Taipei, in another year, I would lose another thirty pounds. To be an elder is much more exhausting than to take care of a training.</P><P>When I was taking care of the churches in northern China, we did this kind of classification at that time. We divided the brothers and sisters into twelve classes. The lowest-numbered class is the dead ones. The highest-numbered class is the living ones. In between are the half-dead ones, and the ones who have been dead for a long time and are about to come alive. After classification, we should not work with the dead ones or the living ones first. Instead, we should work on the ones who are about to come alive. We looked up these people and fellowshipped with them one by one. We invited them to the love feasts and helped them solve all their problems. Sometimes we could not even help them ourselves, and we would ask another brother who had learned the lesson to help them. After we did this for a while, some of these came alive. They were class eleven. Now they have advanced to level twelve. Next, we should work with the ones who are worse, the class-ten ones. After a while, these also will become class twelve. By that time, there will be a sizable number of living ones in the church, and the church will almost become a wave offering; the meetings will become quite living. Once classes ten and eleven have been enlivened, the church is about to move on. For example, in a family the father may be class eleven. The mother may be class ten, and the daughter may be class nine. Once you have enlivened the class-eleven father and the class-ten mother, the daughter will more or less come along. She would say, "Since my father and mother are loving the Lord, I should love the Lord too!" They may have another son in the house who belongs to class eight. Even he will become alive now. If this goes on, by the time the sixth class has been worked with, the church will no longer be a wave offering, but a heave offering as well, and there will be a real revival. Most people will have become living, and the remaining few, even if they are not living, will be made alive together. This is very easy. I wish to tell the brothers and sisters that this was the revival of Chefoo in 1943. The brothers and sisters became alive one after the other, and there was no way for the church to fail to be revived.</P><P>If the elders would classify the brothers and sisters according to their condition and would try to make the dead ones alive, how busy they would be! I worked in this way before the revival in Chefoo. For three years, I went to the meeting hall every morning at 10:30 and stayed until 11:30 each evening. This was what I did the whole day long, considering what kind of leading each person needed and whether I should personally lead them or have others help them. Some who are sitting here can testify the kind of stirring, visitation, and fellowship there was in those days! How did we arrive at such a state? It was because one man was there continually stirring others up. To use the language of the world, he kept promoting until everyone had to act and go out! I worked in this way for three years. By the end of 1942, there were at least eighty or ninety brothers and sisters out of one hundred who were very living. In a short time the revival of the church broke out.</P><P>I am very clear about the condition of the meetings in all the places today. Although everyone has life, the big question is whether or not they are living. The dormant ones are, of course, not living. But even many of the ones who are able to come to the meetings are not living. How much work there is involved to cause these brothers and sisters to come alive.</P><P>Perhaps someone would feel that this is too artificial. If you say this, I can only plead before you in tears that you are too spiritual. If no one beseeches with tears and prays in earnestness, and if no one seeks after the sinners through storm and rain to preach the gospel to them, will they be saved merely by everybody being so spiritual? Let me say this: if you can weep for three days and three nights, and then work for three days to bring a person to salvation, even if this is artificial, it is still the right thing to do. When God works, He needs man's cooperation. We have never seen a place where God has worked while those under Him were lazy. On the contrary, we have seen everywhere that those who are greatly used by the Lord are all diligent. God's work requires man's cooperation.</P><P>In Taipei, there are over three thousand brothers and sisters who do not attend the meetings regularly. Even of those who come, I am afraid that less than half are alive. This is one chief work within the elders' administration. You should find it unbearable to see so many brothers and sisters there not being living, yet you are still serving as an elder in peace. You must have a burden within to beseech the Lord and to find a way. I wish to tell the brothers that if you serve as an elder this way, very soon the fat ones will become the thin ones. This is not a joke. Church administration is not an easy matter. It has to do with the life and death, the blessings and woes, of a large number of people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Bringing Others into the Service</H2><P>The elders have to spend time on this point also. They cannot be loose. You have to know the condition of all the ones who have come alive, their heart toward the Lord, their education, their background, their finances, their family, and their relationship with those around them. Even their physical strength, their health, and their mind must all come under your consideration. In order to bring people into the service, you have to be like a foreman. Not only do you have to call together the workers, but you must have the blueprints, the places to work, and the arrangements for the work. You have to consider the kind of people to send to a certain place and the kind of arrangements that need to be made. Please imagine how much strength, time, and energy it takes to do this! This is the church's administration.</P><P>From the spiritual point of view, you still have to look to God very much to inquire concerning His will and to consider how matters should be handled. You have to consider what needs to be done first, what kind of arrangements you need to make, and what kind of people you should bring in. You must not only look to the Lord yourself, but fellowship with those who are serving together with you. There are many things which you cannot see through by yourself. For example, if you want to bring a brother into the service, not only do you have to fellowship with the elders, but you must ask those who are frequently in touch with this person. You have to find out through whom this person was saved and who has been in touch with him all the time. You have to ask about their feeling concerning this person. You have to be thorough to this extent before you can be safe.</P><P>I want the brothers and sisters to realize that this kind of work is not at all wasted. When you bring one such person into the service, you are actually rendering much unspoken influence to the ones who have helped him to come to salvation and the ones who are in frequent contact with him. When you do this, the church will become living. It is not your teaching, exhortation, or encouragement to such a one to be living; that is useless. It is your working. When one by one the people become living, the church will be filled with the spirit of service.</P><P>During the time from 1940 to 1945, when I was in the administration of the church in Chefoo, I often had my coat pocket full of papers; it contained all kinds of lists. On one list was the schedule for the whole church, what the church should be doing during those days. On another list were the items that needed to be done according to that plan. Still another list enumerated all the items needed. Still another list had all the places needed, and another list, the kind of people needed. On more lists were all the names of the people. Whenever I had time, I would match the names with the needs. Perhaps when I woke up in the morning, I would suddenly feel that a certain person was not suitable. I would immediately mark this down and make the correction. This correction would result in a vacancy. I would immediately look for another person from the list. If I could not find one from the list, I still had to look for one among the brothers and sisters.</P><P>Brothers, the arrangement of the service must be done in such a way before it can be weighty. You cannot lightly say, "Let us bring someone into the service." Neither can you make an announcement, saying, "Brothers and sisters, come and serve!" If you do this, those who are led in this way will not have respect for you. They would feel that you who bear the responsibility are too light and loose. You must be like King Solomon inviting the Queen of Sheba to come and see. When the queen saw his orderly arrangement of matters, her heart was full of respect. With some people, regardless how high their worldly position is or how much achievement they have in education, when they enter into the service, they spontaneously become very respectful. You must command the respect of others. Otherwise, how can they take your leading? By doing this, you are opening up a way and paving a path for others to enter into God's riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Perfecting the Functions</H2><P>The elders cannot bring people into the service and leave them there. They must pay attention to the function in these ones. For instance, when you bring someone to clean the windows in the meeting hall, you should not merely pay attention to whether he is cleaning them or not. You have to pay attention to his function. If you ask him just to clean the windows, you are misusing him and are damaging him. Some are brought into the service this way, but they soon leave the service. They have no interest in the work, because they have not realized their function. This is the result of inaccurate leading. Not only do you have to bring someone in, but you must observe him while you are bringing him in. You must find out what kind of function he has, and through which kind of service he should be perfected. This is the perfecting of the saints spoken of in Ephesians 4. The perfecting there emphasizes the perfecting of the function. We have to spend time to perfect others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Encouraging the Gifts</H2><P>When the brothers and sisters have realized their functions in the service, the gifts will be manifested. At that time, the elders will have to encourage them to develop their gifts. There is much to say about this encouragement.</P><P>You may have to help a person renew his consecration before the Lord. He is a living person and has been brought into the service already. Surely he is consecrated already. But if you have learned the lesson, you will realize that such a one still has some problem with his consecration. There is a problem of degree in his consecration. There is also a problem of nature, of place, and of sovereign right in his consecration. Perhaps he has to learn these lessons over again. We can sense that this brother has life; he is living, and he has been brought into the service. He has some function and some gift, but there is reservation in his consecration. He has only consecrated to a certain extent, up to a point that he cannot get through. Here the elders have to help him pass through the hurdle of consecration afresh.</P><P>Some brothers cannot have their gifts realized because there is a problem with their character. A brother's character may be somewhat lazy. If you can make him somewhat more diligent, his gift will take form.</P><P>Some people may be holding onto some hidden sin. They are not completely cut off from it, and they have not dug everything out completely. You cannot say that they do not love the Lord or that they are not consecrated. They have been brought into the service, and their function is somewhat manifest. Their gift is more or less evident. But somehow, something is missing. It seems that their gift has taken form, yet it is not mature. After probing here and there, you finally discover that this brother still has a hidden sin. If you help him to take care of this, you will be encouraging his gift to be realized. If you can help him solve the problem of his sin, you will see that his gift will immediately take shape. Perhaps by next week his preaching may become more powerful than that of anyone else.</P><P>Brothers, please observe that, although there are many brothers and sisters in all the local churches, the manifestation of the gifts is very scarce! What is the reason for this abnormal condition? It is because the elders who administrate the churches have not done a work that is in depth or to the point. To those who have learned the lesson, it seems that there has never been any work done upon the churches. Everywhere is desolation. There is only a group of people being piled together; everyone merely comes together for the meetings. At most, there is some arrangement as to the time of meeting and some announcement as to the nature of the meeting. You cannot detect any administration that is carried out in depth. Therefore, very few gifts are manifested. If the elders can touch the brothers and sisters to find out if they have life and if they are living, and if the elders can bring them into the service, perfect their functions, and encourage their gifts, you can be assured that there will be many gifted ones in the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Supplying Christ</H2><P>Some brothers and sisters give you the impression that they are very good. They have life and are living. They are brought into the coordination; their functions are realized, and their gifts are manifested. But they have not passed the hurdle of experiencing Christ as life and as their inward fullness. The elders must spend time again to fellowship, pray, and talk with them. They must study the Bible with them and trust that the Holy Spirit will open their understanding to see that the gifts are just the glass containers and that only Christ is the content. Now the question is: every time the gift is exercised, what is in the container? You have to show them that the content of the gift must be Christ. Perhaps there is the need for another consecration here. The last consecration was for something else. This time they have to consecrate their gift. They have to say to the Lord, "Lord, I know that I have all these, but I am still empty inside. I do not have the fullness of Christ. Lord, I am consecrating myself to You again." You have to help them to go over the hurdle and to know the meaning of Christ as life, so that they can enjoy the riches of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Helping to Fellowship</H2><P>By that time, the elders have to help such brothers learn to fellowship with the Lord. This is what we have said many times&#151;to eat, drink, and enjoy God, to touch Christ every day, to have fellowship with Him, to absorb Christ, and to enjoy Him.</P><P>Up to this point, a certain number of brothers and sisters will be brought to a point where their functions will be manifested and their gifts will be realized. Furthermore, they will be able to minister their portion of Christ. They will be able to live in the fellowship and to eat, drink, and enjoy the Lord. How glorious is such a work in the church!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. Perfecting in the Truth</H2><P>Although these brothers and sisters are useful by this time, you will find out that they are not entirely clear in the understanding of the truth. You still have to perfect them in many ways concerning the truth. I can never forget the help I received from one brother ahead of me. Shortly after I had come in contact with him, within less than half a year, he sent me a Bible from far away. This was the New Translation by J.N. Darby. This version gave me a lot of help. I have to admit that before this time I did not know that there was such a version in the universe. Later I left my job and served the Lord full-time. In 1933 I went to Shanghai. I can never forget that one day this brother came with two sets of books. When he saw me, he said, "Brother, all these are yours." After he said this, he went downstairs. When I looked at the two sets, I found that one was a book on the New Testament by Dean Alford. This was the authoritative word study of the New Testament. The other book was the Synopsis of the Books of the Bible by J.N. Darby. At that time, I felt that these two sets were too precious. I can tell you that for over three days I did not eat well, not because I was too sorrowful, but because I was too happy. Every word written in these two sets was like gold to me. They rendered me immeasurable help during those years. I am very clear concerning the perfection that brother rendered me.</P><P>I can still remember that one time I went to the living room of that brother. He came down from upstairs. The minute he sat down he asked me, "Brother, what is patience?" I was trembling all over at that time. I could not answer him at all. He was rocking in his chair and asking, "What is patience?" I said, "Isn't patience to bear with others when they mistreat you?" He said, "No. Patience is just Christ." After he said this, he stood up and said, "Let's go." He took me to the car and drove me home. When I arrived home, I was enlightened within. What is patience? Patience is just Christ! I do not know how much help this word has rendered me.</P><P>Two days later, I was again in his home. He asked, "What are you reading in the Scriptures these days?" I replied, "The book of Acts." He then asked, "What else are you reading?" I said that the book of Colossians seemed very interesting too. He said, "Oh, these two books are the most difficult ones to match together! But actually, only these two books match one another. Acts reveals to us how Christ is the Head, and Colossians shows what kind of Head He is." I wanted to hear more, but he would not say any more. I can tell the brothers and sisters that when I went home to read these two books again, I got the light, and I saw that indeed, only Colossians can match the book of Acts. Acts portrays to us a resurrected and ascended Head, whereas Colossians shows us how rich the Head is and how He is everything. I must say that I had received this brother's perfecting. His influence was very great, and the results were also very great.</P><P>Oh, brothers, the administration of the church is not a simple matter. The matter of coordination alone includes so many things. Today we can only stop here.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Helping Others to Solve Their Problems</H2><P>In serving the Lord, everyone will sooner or later have some problems. These problems come from many areas. For example, some sisters have a genuine desire to serve. They have been helped through the previous eight points. Yet their husbands are very much opposed to them. This is a problem. As far as their husbands' opposition is concerned, they can only stay at home and cannot come to the meeting or to the services. How are you going to help such a one with her problem?</P><P>Take for example another brother who has the genuine calling to serve full-time. Yet he has a problem with his job. Should he continue with his job? Should he drop his job right away, or should he still continue in the job? It is true that this is a question between him and God, but you can see that he needs help here.</P><P>Another case is that of a brother whom you may feel is really suitable to be an elder. According to his experience of grace and his condition in life, he is a good candidate to be an elder. Yet his job takes up all of his time from morning till evening. As a result, there is no way for him to serve as an elder. How are you going to help him solve this problem of time?</P><P>Again, there are other brothers and sisters who can serve and who should at the same time continue a job, yet their incomes are not enough for them to live by. What should be done? Perhaps you can talk spiritually, saying, "Look to the Lord! Have faith!" I dislike this kind of light-hearted spiritual talk. The problem is still there. You have to help them solve the problem.</P><P>Again, there are those who really have a heart for the Lord and have learned some spiritual lessons, but they have some problem with their health. Their income is inadequate to provide an adequate diet. How are you going to help them to solve their problem? We cannot give some spiritual advice in the way of a spectator who is not involved. This is useless, and it will never help others. This is not to say that we should not trust in God, but there are some things that we should do ourselves. For this reason, we need to help the brothers and sisters solve their problems. It is not an easy matter to manage a church. If we do not do any of the things we have mentioned, we can still be an elder. But if we are to manage thoroughly, all these matters are things to be considered.</P><P>This is like managing a home. If your child does not have any clothes to wear, you cannot say, "Good, just go and pray! Trust in the Lord!" You cannot say this. If the weather has turned cold today, you have to change the children's clothes for them. If the older brothers simply say to pray, and the older sister simply says to pray, and even the mother simply says to pray, it will not work this way. This is not a question of prayer. You cannot trust the Lord to do something instead of you. As parents, you have the responsibility. If you do not manage the home, but go to the movies and the games every day, and leave the children at home, you can do this. Your family will still survive all year round from spring to winter. But if you do this, what kind of a home will this be? In order for your home to be proper, you have to take care of every area. You have to do something, because there are all kinds of needs in a family.</P><P>In the same principle, with something as big as a church, there are bound to be some brothers who have learned the lessons and who have been called. Yet they have such things as family burdens, physical problems, material needs, and family opposition. All these are problems. You cannot just say, "Pray about them!" Of course they have to pray about them. But you have to realize that there is a question of human responsibility also. In order for the coordination of the church to be strong and powerful and to be advancing all the time, you cannot neglect these matters. You may have helped others through all the previous eight points. Now you have to make arrangements to take care of their practical human needs.</P><P>Some have problems with their marriages. They may have been involved in a romance with another before. For instance, a sister may have loved a man, or a brother may have loved a girl before they were saved. What are they going to do now? They have learned the lesson and have indeed grown. But here is a history of a romance. It is a problem. How are you going to help them terminate the relationship? Still there are cases where two persons are engaged, but are not married yet. Now one party has decided to cancel the engagement. What are you going to do? You cannot say, "Just pray. The grace of Christ is great and manyfold and sufficient!" This will not work. You still have to help them terminate the relationship practically. You can see that the flowers that are in the fields grow in one kind of way, and the flowers that are planted in the garden, that have been cultivated and cared for by man, grow in another kind of way.</P><P>Problems such as these that have to do with the church and with the family are many, and you will encounter them all. How can you render the help? When the brothers and sisters come to you for fellowship, you cannot say only the spiritual words. What kind of help are you going to give to them? How are you going to help them solve the problems? This is a necessary work. Some people have been helped by you through all the eight points. If they cannot get through in some of these problems, all your previous efforts will be in vain. Perhaps it is for this reason that the ones you have helped have gone downhill one after another. Therefore, you must never neglect this matter.</P><P>Some brothers and sisters have received a lot of grace. They have been brought through the eight points, they know the truth, and they have the experience of life. Yet they have come into an argument with the elders, or they have come into an argument with another serving brother. Here is another problem. How are you going to help them solve it? You have to bear some responsibility to help them take care of this problem. Otherwise they will go downhill.</P><P>Dear brothers and sisters, it is not enough just to say spiritual words. Even in the preaching of the gospel, many times you must kneel down to the ground. Your cry must come before God always, and you must preach the gospel to others with sweat on your brow. Only then will others be saved. You cannot just say, "Look to God! Pray that God would work!" You can try and see if others will be saved this way. Brothers, this is not the way. There are duties that we have to fulfill.</P><P>Please consider the churches in all the places. We have to admit our shortcomings. The overseeing of the elders in all the churches is quite inadequate. Here are a few brothers who have served with me in northern China for a long time. I believe they can testify from their conscience how we helped the brothers and sisters at that time. If you cannot help the brothers and sisters, up to a certain time they will face problems, and all your previous efforts will be lost. This is like having a child and raising him up to over ten years of age. When he is ill with a serious sickness, the parents will surely look for his healing earnestly. Why do they do this? Here is a problem. If they do not deal with it, the child may die. This is the way you should look at the problems of the brothers and sisters. You have to solve their problem, or else they will go down.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Helping Others To Receive Burdens</H2><P>The elders should not only help the brothers and sisters to solve their problems, but should also help them in a definite way to receive some burdens from the Lord. They should not merely receive a general burden, but a burden to be a responsible one in a district, or to be an elder. Although you are simply an elder, and not an apostle, you can still help them to receive such a burden. They have been perfected to a certain extent and should receive a certain burden. Here you have to render them some help. Of course, this cannot be done in three or five words; there is the need for a long period of fellowshipping with the Lord. On the one hand, you need to contact them many times, fellowship with them much, touch their hearts, and know their feelings before the Lord. On the other hand, you have to pray for them always, to touch the Lord's feeling and the Lord's will regarding them. Gradually and naturally, you will be able to help them to receive a burden.</P><P>Not only do you have to bring them into the service and to accept the arrangements in the service of the church, you have to help them to have some genuine coordination. The so-called arrangements are often quite shallow. They only afford people an opportunity to learn something and receive some grace. Strictly speaking, this may not be the coordination in the Body.</P><P>For example, a brother or sister may be brought into the ushering service. You may feel that he or she has entered the service, but there may not be any genuine coordination yet. You still have to spend time with this one, to help him or her to have some dealings before the Lord, to grow, and to be perfected. Up to a time, his condition will be different from what it was when he first joined the service. When he first began to serve, he was unconcerned; he was saved, and he had a little love and was a little revived. When he was assigned to the ushering service, or the cleaning service, or the business-office service, he merely did the job. Now as an elder, you have worked with him, perfected him, and helped him again and again; he has been brought on to quite an extent and has reached quite a standard before the Lord. By this time, he will have a definite burden in the church. He will not only have some general and inconsequential services. He will not only be receiving a notice from others informing him of his assignment, whether it is gospel visitation, visitation of the saints, business-office duty, record keeping, or bookkeeping, and going along with such an assignment. Now he has gone through some dealings and has learned something. He has reached a state where something has taken form. He should now accept a definite burden. By this time, he has been brought into the service by you practically. He may receive a burden to be a district responsible one, taking care of a district meeting. Or he may receive a burden to be a minister of the Word or a gospel preacher for the rest of his life. This is to bring someone on in life before God and to help him to receive a definite burden.</P><P>I say again that you cannot be too objective or too spiritual on their behalf in these matters. Some see another who has tuberculosis and say, "Brother, just look to the Lord." Or they see a sister who has an ulcer and say, "Sister, you should trust the Lord." However, when they themselves have tuberculosis, they go to the doctor faster than anyone else! It is of no use to have faith for others. It is likewise useless to say light-hearted words and to take an objective stand. You must place yourself in their position, and consider their situation as if you are right there.</P><P>The whole New Testament shows that other than the twelve apostles who were helped by the Lord Jesus in the flesh, you can hardly find another one who was called to serve the Lord like Paul, who was directly perfected by the Lord. But if you read Paul's teaching, you will find out that he was always charging the responsible ones in the church to learn to help others and perfect them in spiritual things. Men like Timothy and Titus were all perfected by the church and by the men of God. Hence, we must never neglect this matter.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Taking Others Along to Learn</H2><P>After an elder has helped a brother or sister to receive a burden, immediately he should take them along to learn to do the work. For example, when you help someone to pick up the responsibility of a district meeting, your duty is not yet finished. You must still help him to learn how to bear the responsibility of this district. You must show him in a practical way how to do the job. After he understands what you are doing, you have to ask him to do the same, while you are by his side to correct him. You have to take him along in the learning. This is what the elders have to do.</P><P>Brothers, let me repeat this: if every elder is willing to practice this, they will be busy every day; they will not find themselves having nothing to do. I can also testify that there is no work more effective than this work. This kind of work seems to be slow, but gradually, you will see the result. In half a year, a brother will be perfected by you. After another period, another brother will be perfected by you again. Five years ago, there might have been only three or five people working. After five years, it becomes thirty or fifty people working. The result will be abounding.</P><P>Unfortunately, not too many elders are taking others along to learn in this way. Brothers, if you are wise, you should adopt this way quickly. The result of our managing of the church proves that we have to change from our former ways.</P><P>Everyone knows that agricultural products always need improvement. The seed needs to be improved, the method of planting needs to be improved, and the harvesting needs to be improved. Only by improving can there be better results. It is foolish for a man to be stubborn, proud, and conservative. We must learn to improve. This is not to say that what I am sharing has reached the highest peak. No, I am only here to open the way. If you are willing to walk in this pathway, you will discover that you will learn many lessons. At the same time, the church you are managing will also take on a different form.</P><P>I want to mention one thing in passing: I hope that those among us, whether it is the elders or the workers, would be fully delivered from the Christianity way of doing things. The way of Christianity depends very much upon the preacher. Christianity likes to invite Dr. Chang to speak today and Pastor Wang to speak tomorrow. After a few days, another famous evangelist will be invited to speak. But what is the result of all these speakings? We can say that there is not much result. For this reason, I absolutely do not agree that any district meeting or local church should invite one co-worker to speak today and another to speak tomorrow. This is useless. Dear brothers, even if you have invited all of the co-workers to speak, and even if all of them have indeed come and spoken, you are still you; you have not changed. At most you have a few people saved, or more than that, you may have a few more people to love the Lord. But what use does this have? You can never see the building up of the church or the coordination of the church. To have the building and the coordination, there is the need for the responsible ones to labor.</P><P>It is all right if you have a humble heart, and you want to assume a learning position and to listen to an academic lecture. But the question is: do you have a laboratory to experiment in? Do you have a field in which to practice? The real work is done in the field; it does not come through listening to an academic lecture. For this reason, we the workers have to always hate this kind of academic, lecture-type work. We do not go to any place to hold academic lectures. We are there to take up the proper work of the building up of the church. To have mere meetings and preachings is useless. It is useless to give eight or ten messages. But even if you were to give a hundred or two hundred messages, it would still be useless. This is the way of fallen Christianity; we should not bring this way in. The responsible ones in every locality have to put in the labor. They should not hope to invite this worker or that worker to come and speak to them.</P><P>This is like some parents who do not manage their homes properly day in and day out, but expect others to speak for them and teach for them. What use does it have? If you are willing to put in the labor, even if you cannot cook, you will learn in half a month, and even if you do not know how to take care of children, you will learn in a month. As long as you are willing to learn, soon you will be able to do it.</P><P>Let me repeat: the management and building up of the church does not depend on inviting speakers. This is not the way among us. I hope that we would all change our concept and our view, and would accept another way. You must put yourselves in the church where you are, give yourself to the work there, and labor there. There is no other way. Even if you were to invite the apostle Paul, the apostle Peter, Apollos, and all the others to come to speak, you would still be you. It would not have much use. The only thing that is useful is for you to be subdued and to see that the church is God's garden, and that there is the need for some to be the farmers, to toil and plow with sweat. They should also see that the church is the house of God, committed to their care. They should be like a housewife, cleaning the windows, mopping the floors, making the dresses, mending the clothes, cooking the meals, eating the leftovers, and laboring in suffering. Only then will the house prosper. If you do not do these things, even if you were to listen to a thousand messages or ten thousand messages, they would still do you no good.</P><P>One thing continually bothers me: though I have fellowshipped much about this in the past, the brothers are still unchanged; they still love the way of Christianity. Brothers, why do we have to have so many conferences? What is the use of them all? Consider the chapels in the denominations. Which great doctors in theology have not preached in those places? Which evangelist has not visited these places? Which world-famous evangelist has not spoken there? The doctors, the eloquent ones, the educated ones have all spoken there. But what about the church? It is still in desolation. Since this is the case, are we still going to take this way that does not work? No, we must take a practical way. We have to go back to our own church in a proper way. We have to do everything ourselves. Gradually, you will see that the local church where you are, or the district where you are will have some improvement. Let others have the academic lectures. No matter how high or spiritual their talks are, they are flying in the air. You should just put your feet on solid ground and do some solid work. Here lies the management and the building up of the church.</P><P>Brothers, do not expect an angel to come to your place to have a week's conference, and the church where you are will be revived. Do not cherish such a hope. Be subdued to do a slow work. Touch everyone. Help the saints to live before the Lord and to enjoy Christ. When there are practical needs, help them. I would like to say that even when they have financial needs, and you are able, share what you have with them. You do not need to call it a consecration or a supply. As long as a brother has nothing to eat, and as long as you have a meal, you should take half of it, and share the other half with him. This is not so much a matter of consecration as it is a mutual sharing in life to serve the Lord. In this way, you will have something to eat, and he will have something to eat. This is wonderful. If you are able to do so, you should earn some money for his use. This is the principle of Paul's making tents. Paul said that he worked with his two hands to supply the need of himself and those with him. You have to bear the burden of the brothers and sisters who are your members. If you can bear the burden to such an extent, you will find out if God will bless your work or not! If you are willing to do this, you will see the blessing coming; it is useless for you to invite others to preach.</P><P>The building of the church is a slow work. It requires strength. You cannot count on luck, and you cannot put your hope in others. I believe all the sisters who are housewives can testify. You know how much work there is in the house. You can never expect another one to replace you. Only by laboring, striving, working away at your own home can you expect your house to be in order. The house of God, the church, has been entrusted to the elders' care. The elders are the housewives; they can only labor and strive. The building up of the church depends on the laboring of the elders. It will not work to merely have revival meetings. You must put yourselves into the hard work. Only after you have worked hard will you see the harvest, just as a farmer sees his crop.</P><P>I hope that the elders in all the churches would grasp this principle and would invest their energy in all the places. To be good at preaching may not yield a good result. In some places, this may even make things worse. The fewer conferences there are, the better it is. Save the time to contact the people one by one. Spend time to deal with them one by one and help them to learn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Helping Others to Become Proper Vessels</H2><P>Not only do the elders have to exercise patience to help the brothers and sisters learn, they have to help them to become proper vessels. Do not worry that their function may become greater than yours. You have to hope that among your disciples some will become the laureates. The Chinese have a saying that one only finds laureate students and never laureate teachers. The teacher may not be a laureate, but among his students, some may become laureates. Do not be afraid that among those whom you are leading, some will become more useful or capable than you are. If such a thing indeed happens, it should be your glory. How glorious a thing it would be if among those whom you lead, some would become a Peter, a Paul, or a greatly-used vessel. You have to do your best to perfect and help them to become proper vessels.</P><P>I believe the brothers and sisters can realize that except the point about ascertaining life in a person, which is relatively easy to do, all the other points, from the second point on, are difficult to carry out. Not one point is easy to achieve. Let me repeat: this is a matter of laboring.</P><P>I do not have the time or the occasion to point out all the details of every point. For many years I have hoped to sit down with a group of elders once a week and fellowship with them about how to help people become proper vessels. Here is a person who loves the Lord. How will you help him become a useful vessel? Many things need to be considered in this matter.</P><P>I can never forget those elderly brothers who have rendered me help. I can never forget the way they have perfected me. Without that perfecting, I know that I would be a completely different person today. I can be at least a little useful today because they have perfected me.</P><P>I think I can give a little testimony here. From 1930 to 1934, when I was very young and had just entered into the Lord's calling, I went to Shanghai, where the center of the Lord's work for the whole country was located. When I first arrived, the one who was leading me handed over to me the platform of the church. Whether I could do that work or not, I had to do it. I knew that he was giving me an opportunity in order to perfect me. Furthermore, the Gospel Book Room, which has a history of over forty years among us, was the responsibility of Brother Nee alone during 1933 and 1934. Within a very short time, he quickly handed over to me a part of the responsibility for the literature work. I admit that I could not do this work, for I had never done it before. But here was an opportunity. I was thankful to the Lord, and I was also extremely grateful to our brother! To me this was a kind of perfecting. By the Lord's mercy, I can see the result of that perfecting twenty years ago. Today, we can have a book room and the publication of some literature all because of this perfecting.</P><P>When I received this commission in Shanghai, I was in fear and trembling. I had never worked with anyone else before that time, and I had never taken any lead in any work. I had only raised up a small meeting in a small place in Chefoo. Now suddenly a big meeting was put on my shoulders. I can never forget that very day, for many times I prayed only one prayer, the prayer of Solomon: "Lord, I am only a young man. You have raised me up to walk in and out among Your people. Lord, give me the wisdom." When I look back now, I can see that many of the lessons were learned during that time; I was pressed into learning those lessons then. That was a perfecting work. It was a rare opportunity, one which could not be purchased with a million dollars.</P><P>Hence, brothers, for the sake of the Lord, for the sake of His kingdom, His interest on earth, we have to learn to perfect a group of people and to make them the right vessels. Not only do we need a little perfecting; we need a great perfecting. We must clear the ground for them to have the opportunity to be perfected, so as to prepare them for future use.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Leading Others to Accept the Cross</H2><P>This is an absolutely necessary lesson. There is a reason for me to put this point as point number thirteen. Up to this point, you have to help the brothers and sisters to practically, seriously, and deeply learn the lesson of the cross. The things to deal with are the carnality, the flesh, the ambition, the haughty aspirations, and the desire to accomplish something for oneself. There is the need for the cross to break the desire for greatness in a person. By this point, a person has somewhat become a vessel. There is a certain amount of danger and a great temptation in being a vessel. It is easy to go from being a vessel to becoming famous. On a larger scale, a person can become renowned in Christianity. On a smaller scale, that one can become the pivotal figure in a local church. He can manipulate the situation and can influence the brothers and sisters. By that time, you have to help such a one to learn the lesson of the cross. The carnality, the flesh, the ambition, the aspirations, the self-interest, and the desire to be great must all be terminated on the cross.</P><P>Brothers, I have been severely taught in this matter. I know that there is such a need here. If we do not do this, all the labor we have exerted in the past will again go to waste. Without the cross, points one to twelve will all be wasted, and the person will be damaged. He will be damaged by greatness. You have spent so much energy and effort to perfect such a one. In the end, his ambition and aspirations will cause your labor to disappear into thin air. In addition, you will end up with one more problem in the church. This one has learned something; he is able to manipulate the situation and can influence everyone. Consider this pride, this striving for self-interest, this desire to be great, to be superficial, and to be famous. Will it damage such a person alone? Will it hurt him alone? This will damage the whole church. Therefore, up to this point, you have to learn this lesson, and you have to help him learn this lesson. Otherwise, the coordination will be affected.</P><P>If there is no cross in the coordination, the church will be without any protection. As far as you are concerned, you may have the mercy to supply others the grace despite whether they are great or small. But as far as they are concerned, they are damaged. And as far as the church is concerned, the loss is even greater! Hence, for their sake, for the church's sake, you have to help them learn the lesson of the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Leading Others to Learn Brokenness</H2><P>A person who has accepted the cross is not necessarily one who is broken. The cross solves the problems of man before man. Brokenness solves the problems of man before God. Our natural strength must go through God's breaking. The problems before men are the carnality, the flesh, the ambition and aspiration, the desire for achievement, fame, and greatness in the church. But even if you have solved these problems, you have to remember that the natural strength in serving the Lord must be broken by Him. You have to allow God to touch you deeper, to touch the hollow of your thigh, so that you would fall down. You have to help the brothers to this stage. Otherwise, the coordination will not be long-lasting. They can coordinate with you, but very soon they will be damaged. For this reason, you have to help the brothers to accept the breaking and to be a person subdued before God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. Leading Others to Accept Coordination</H2><P>It is at this point that we can have genuine coordination. This is not the coordination we had when we first entered into the service. It is the coordination that comes after we have learned many lessons. It is only at this point that such a person truly understands what it means to accept coordination before God. To accept coordination is nothing other than to accept the restriction of those who are fellow members and who are serving together with you. Coordination is a restriction; it is a total restriction by others. I cannot serve alone; I can only serve together with the brothers and sisters in the church. I can only accept the others' restriction and coordinate with them. If they are spiritual, I have to coordinate with them. If they are not spiritual, I also have to coordinate with them. If they are deep, I have to coordinate with them. If they are superficial, I also have to coordinate with them. If they are natural, I have to coordinate with them. If they are carnal, I still have to coordinate with them. I can only stand on their side. I cannot ask them to stand on my side. All the reasons for not being able to coordinate should not come from my side. I have been led to learn the lesson of the cross and have been broken. Today I will take the restriction of the whole church. I accept this coordination. At this time, we will have the genuine coordination, and at this time, such a coordination will be in oneness, and it will be knitted together firmly and fitted together properly.</P><P>Brothers, you and I are still in the flesh. If we never arrive at this stage, our mutual coordination can never be lasting. There can be many reasons for problems caused in our coordination. There are the carnality, the opinions, and the misunderstandings. There are also the many works of the enemy. Only when we reach this stage can our carnality, opinions, misunderstandings, and the works of the enemy lose their effectiveness. Towards all the things that are not of God, this is a body that is immune; no bacteria can have any effect on it. This is the only kind of coordination that is solid and lasting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Leading Others to Know the Body</H2><P>By this time, they will come into a realm; they will touch something and will realize the glorious fact that the church is the Body of Christ. They will truly touch the reality of the Body. By that time, you will have done a glorious work before the Lord. Only this can be considered the true building up of the church. Only this can be considered the true managing of the church. Only then is there a true coordination worked out.</P><P>Perhaps of the three to five hundred brothers and sisters serving in coordination here, only twenty to thirty have arrived at such a kind of coordination, while all the other ones are outside such a coordination. We do not at all belittle those who are outside this coordination, for a person has to have the outward coordination before he can have the inward coordination. But the twenty or thirty brothers and sisters who have been brought through each of the preceding ten or more points have finally reached this last point and have really come to realize what the Body is. The coordination for these is deep, genuine, and weighty. The life of the church depends upon them, and the life span of the church depends upon them. They are like the kernel within an almond seed, where the life is contained and where the center of life exists. The church is completely hinged upon them and is entrusted to them. With such a center, the church will be stable and firm. We should also believe that these twenty or thirty people will go on to lead others, just as we do. After a period of time, they will bring forth manyfold others like themselves. In this way the church will ever continue to reproduce and will be built up. This is the management of the church. If the elders will go on in this way, I believe many will discover a rich wellspring.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><P>The central work in the management of the church by the elders is to coordinate the brothers and sisters. Strictly speaking, to manage is to coordinate, and to coordinate is to build. The elders' work of managing the church is to coordinate and build up the brothers and sisters. Where there is real management, there is real coordination, and where there is real coordination, there is real building. We have said much about the management of the church. The central goal for speaking about this matter is to speak about coordination. For this reason we stayed on the matter of coordination for a long time. Because of time, I spoke only sixteen points. Strictly speaking, there are many more lessons to give on coordination. Moreover, the sixteen points given must be explained by practical, real, and detailed examples. All the fine points and detailed considerations in our work occur in the matter of coordination.</P><P>For example, we have to help the brothers and sisters to solve their problems. This one item alone has much for us to learn. In our following the Lord and serving Him, we often encounter many problems. For example, there are problems with family, with jobs, with education, with marriage, with spiritual progress, with the study of the Bible, and with prayer. There are too many problems. How should we solve them all? If possible, we should spend much time to illustrate them point by point with examples. We can only mention them in brief now and will leave it up to the brothers to probe into them in detail. Strictly speaking, the one item of solving others' problems will alone require much practice for many sessions.</P><P>For example, a person listening to the gospel may have a girlfriend. Now this person is saved, but the girl has not yet believed. The question is brought before the elders. How are you going to solve this problem? The elders cannot merely say: "Brother, just pray!" Of course he has to pray. But you have to show him a way that fits his present condition and that does not contradict the biblical truth. It has to pose no hindrance to his future following of the Lord and not put him in difficulty with his family. This is not a very easy thing to do.</P><P>Take another example. Some young people may be graduating from high school. They are zealous in pursuing the Lord, and they come to you for fellowship. What kind of university should they attend? Should they study medicine, or should they study engineering, or some other subjects? Do not think that this is a light matter. Many times, their choice has much to do with their future growth in life and their usefulness in service. You cannot say something rashly and expect them to act rashly! You may be a little spiritual and say: "Go and pray! The Lord will lead you." This will not work. You have to touch their real condition, bring them to the Lord, and solve the problem before the Lord.</P><P>Some brothers had two wives before they were saved. Now they are saved. How should they solve this family problem? How will this affect such a one in his service to the Lord? What attitude should he take in the future? What kind of stand should he have? There are many questions such as these. If the elders cannot open a way for others in these matters, and cannot solve their problems, they are short in management. The brothers and sisters will suffer and will be like children without the care of their parents.</P><P>If one of your children was bitten by a dog today and ran home to tell you, "Daddy, Mommy, I have been bitten by a dog," would you pat his back and say, "Just pray, the Lord is almighty"? You would not do this! Of course, you have to pray, but you must face the real situation also. Sometimes a child may come home and say, "I lost my diary on the way home from school. I need to buy another one." You cannot say to him, "Just pray." This is not the way to manage a home. When a problem arises with the children, you have to open up a way for them, and you have to help them solve the problem. This is only a simple illustration.</P><P>The church is the house of God. There are many brothers and sisters. Some are old, others are young. Some are deep, others are shallow. Some have experience, others are without experience. Some have problems, others have difficulties before the Lord. These brothers and sisters are continually confronted by problems. If the elders do not try to solve these problems, there will be no problem, because all the brothers and sisters will know that the elders cannot solve problems, and they will not come to the elders. But if you really know the way to manage a church and will really take up such a burden, the door to your house will be daily jammed with people. One brother will come to you with his marriage problem. Another brother will come to you with a problem at work. One sister may come to you with her problem of education. Another may come with a problem of studying the Bible. Still others may come with a problem in prayer, or a problem with their calling; they do not know if they are called, and they do not know how to answer God's calling. All these people will come to you. As a rule, the more the brothers and sisters come to the elders, the better it is. If the brothers and sisters do not come to the elders, I am afraid it means that the elders have lost their job. To have lost your job means to have become unfaithful in your ministry. If you are not unfaithful to your ministry, you will find that every day there will be brothers and sisters coming to you. This is because they have many problems. I am simply elaborating on one of the sixteen points of coordination that I have mentioned. The elders have to practice this in a practical way. They have to help the brothers and sisters to bring together all the problems and to solve them together. In this way, they will bring the church to a proper condition.</P><P>Brothers, I can give you my testimony. When we were first raised up by the Lord, we were led by the Lord to realize that the whole of Christianity has been deformed and has departed from the Lord's way. It has lost the original position that the Lord ordained for it and has lost its original nature. This is why, when we first began to meet, we threw away everything we saw in Christianity. When we came together, we did not know anything. We did not know how to meet, and we did not even know how to pick a hymn in the meeting. We began to probe a little at a time. First we probed the way to meet. Then we probed the way to pick the hymns. Up to a certain point, the management of the church became a big and serious question. At the beginning we had only six or seven people; everyone had a strong desire to go on, and there did not seem to be the need for much management. But gradually, we grew to eight, ten, twenty, and then thirty. By that time, we preached the gospel. When some were saved, we baptized them. Gradually, we increased from fifty to one hundred, and one hundred to two hundred, and the number became larger and larger. By that time, a serious question arose: how were we going to manage all these brothers and sisters?</P><P>At that time we could not find any reference book on the subject of church management, nor could we find a place to learn from. There was no place to ask for help. Later we turned ourselves back to God and spent much time to probe through actual experiences ourselves. We have probed for over ten years. It was not until 1944 and 1945 that we became quite clear concerning the matter of church management.</P><P>I have repeatedly said that the main element in church management is to bring the brothers and sisters step by step into the coordination. Because of the limitation of time, we were unable to consider this matter in detail. Now let us consider some directions in our coordination.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE DIRECTIONS IN COORDINATION</H2><P>The directions in coordination are three, which we have already spoken about. They are the gospel, the perfecting, and the service. Every one of these three items of church service is a direction in coordination. In their management of the church and in bringing the brothers and sisters into the coordination, first the elders have to take the gospel as their direction. They must coordinate the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel. Second, they must take the perfecting as a direction, perfecting them in the coordination. Third, they must take the service as a direction, bringing them into the church service. The directions in coordination are always these three things: the gospel, the perfecting, and the service. The sixteen points mentioned earlier discuss how we bring the brothers and sisters step by step into the coordination. Here we are talking about what direction they should take after they have been coordinated together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Gospel</H2><P>The first direction in coordination is to help the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel. The elders must always lead them in the direction of the gospel. They must help the saints to be active in the gospel, to strive in the gospel, and to bear fruit in the gospel. They must bring the new ones into the church through the gospel. In other words, they have to continually spread the Lord's kingdom through the gospel.</P><P>Never think that anyone can preach the gospel; no, there are certain qualifications here. You can see that some are effective in preaching the gospel, whereas others are not effective in preaching the gospel. With some preaching, people will be saved. With some other preaching, no one will be saved. There is a question of the way and the method. I hope the brothers and sisters would pay attention to the following points.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Zeal</H2><P>The elders must lead the brothers and sisters to be zealous in the gospel. If a local church is lacking in zeal for the gospel, that church must be sick. Regardless whether a local church is large or small, it must have zeal for the gospel. Of course, the elders have to personally cultivate this zeal for the gospel.</P><P>a. The elders themselves have to pray for zeal for the gospel.</P><P>b. The elders have to have zeal for the gospel themselves.</P><P>c. The elders have to gather the brothers and sisters together to have some prayers of the church, asking for the zeal of the gospel. All the brothers and sisters have to come together to call on the Lord, to ask God to stir up the fire of the gospel, so that everyone would acquire a zeal for the gospel. Oh, dear brothers and sisters, the fire of the gospel needs to be stirred up. If you do not stir it up, it will not burn. Please remember that according to God's ordination, the fire of the burnt offering on the Old Testament altar must not go out from morning to evening and from evening to morning. It was necessary for the priests to add wood to that fire continually. The priests had to be responsible to take care of it and to keep it burning. In the same way, the zeal of the gospel needs the stirring up of the elders.</P><P>I hope the elders would have an impression that one of the jobs of the elders is to stir up the fire of the gospel in their local church. They have to increase the wood regularly, stir up the fire regularly, and cause the brothers and sisters to become zealous for the gospel regularly. It is not right to go to a local church and find the brothers and sisters interested in spiritual things, yet cold towards the gospel. There is something wrong in this kind of situation. No matter how big a church is and how mature and deep in experience it is, it must have the fire of the gospel. This is one thing that the elders have to be responsible for. The church must have zeal for the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Power</H2><P>The church must have not only zeal for the gospel, but also the power of the gospel. Of course, this requires that the elders pay attention to the filling of the Holy Spirit. They must have dealings and consecrations before the Lord, and they must accept by faith the Lord's death and resurrection, together with the Holy Spirit that comes through His ascension. The elders cannot relax in this matter. They must lead the brothers and sisters to seek after the filling of the Holy Spirit all the time. On the one hand, we very much disagree with the so-called Pentecostal movement that has existed in the church during the last one hundred or so years. Yet on the other hand, there is the definite need to help the brothers and sisters, under normal circumstances, to receive the power of the Holy Spirit before God. This is also a matter within the elders' management.</P><P>Let me repeat again, brothers, that the management of the church is just like the management of a home. If a housewife neglects the house throughout the month, but eats, sleeps, and plays day after day, the house will still survive. But if she wants to manage the house well, there will be no end to her work, from morning to evening, and from the first day until the last day. Consider only one item: the cleaning. There are so many things to clean, to mop, and to wash. The same is true with the church. If you want to manage it well, there are too many things to do.</P><P>Those who manage a church must never take things easy, as if there were nothing to do. They must never have a feeling like this: "We have the preaching meeting on Sunday morning, the breaking of bread meeting in the evening, the prayer meeting on Tuesday evening, the Bible study on Thursday evening, and the fellowship meeting on Saturday evening. Thank and praise the Lord. We have so many meetings in a week already. This is good enough. Our brothers and sisters do not have serious sicknesses or any deaths. There are not too many who are out of work. Thank and praise the Lord. We have only thirty or more brothers and sisters. Most of them come to the meetings, and none of them is having too much trouble. We are very, very good." Let me tell you this: you can rest in peace, but the Lord cannot rest in peace. You have been meeting in that place for two or three years already, yet there are still only thirty or more brothers and sisters. There has been no increase in number for over a year. How can that be? As an elder, you have to rise up to stir up the fire of the gospel. You cannot rest in peace. You have to go to bed a little later and get up a little earlier. You have to pray, to call on the Lord to give the church the zeal of the gospel, and to have every brother and sister burning within. If you can stir up the fire, many works will follow.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Truth</H2><P>For the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel, there must not only be the zeal and the power without the truth; the elders have to spend the time to help them to know the truth. They have to teach them the meaning of repentance, redemption, substitution, regeneration, justification, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit for the conviction of men. When the brothers and sisters have the zeal and the power to preach the gospel, they must not preach haphazardly; they must have the basis of the truth with them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Guidance</H2><P>The elders must also help the brothers and sisters to receive guidance regarding the move in the gospel. They should not run without aim, wasting time or beating the air. Instead, they should be able to receive the Lord's leading.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Targets</H2><P>When the brothers and sisters are raised up to preach the gospel, and they have the zeal, the power, the truth, and the guidance, they still need the elders' help in finding the people to preach to and the targets of the gospel. The elders have to point out that with some, the target should be their family, while with others, the target should be their schools. The elders have to teach the brothers and sisters to look for gospel targets among these people. They must help the brothers and sisters to consider everyone they know and those within their sphere as the targets and objects of the gospel. If you are a teacher, your school, colleagues, and students are your gospel targets. If you have a factory, the workers in your factory are the targets and the objects. In addition, all our relatives should be our gospel targets and objects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Skill</H2><P>The elders must also lead the brothers and sisters to learn the skill in preaching the gospel. If the brothers and sisters do not know how to preach the gospel or are not familiar with the skills of preaching the gospel, the church will not be a proper church. This can be compared to what happens in a family; it is a great joke for the children of a household not to be able even to cook their own rice or boil their own water. If a local church is properly managed, built up, and coordinated, most of the brothers and sisters should be able to preach the gospel. They should all have learned this skill.</P><P>For this reason, the elders have to spend time to teach the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel. They should teach them to pray for others, to visit others, to bring others to the gospel meetings, and to take other brothers and sisters along to preach the gospel. These are the outward and rough aspects of the job. Besides this, there are the inward and finer aspects of the work, which deal with the way to talk to people, the way to touch others' feeling during the conversation, the way to impress others' heart, the way to understand others' mind, the way to open up people's understanding, and the way to help others to pray. They should know when to argue, when to advance, when to debate even if the others do not want to debate, and when not to argue. They should know when to use the words of the Bible, when to ask them to confess their sins, and when to ask them to pray. All these require skill.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Tools</H2><P>The six points we have covered are not enough; we also need the tools for the gospel preaching. We have to prepare different types of Bibles&#151;large and small, the whole Bible, the New Testament, the separate books, the expensive ones, and the economical ones. These Bibles must be available before we go out to preach the gospel. In order to preach the gospel, we have to have Bibles. It is sad that, when some come to the church for a Bible, the responsible ones would say: "Go to the Bible Society for your Bible!" This may sound very good, but it proves that this church is sick in the matter of preaching the gospel.</P><P>Other than Bibles, there are other tools, such as tracts, booklets, gospel stories, testimonies, and gospel posters. All these are gospel tools, and they are necessary for the preaching of the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Purpose</H2><P>Why should we preach the gospel? What is the purpose of the gospel? We must impress this upon every brother and sister. We have to tell the brothers and sisters who are preaching the gospel that the purpose of the gospel is for men to receive the Lord's life, to enliven men's spirit, to regenerate them in the spirit, and to enable men to take the Lord as their life.</P><P>Our gospel should not gain only some who are barely saved but who are not clear about the matter of life. We should not have only those who seem to have believed in Jesus and who have been forgiven of their sins, but who do not seem to have been regenerated. Seemingly, this word is not according to the truth, for no one is saved without being regenerated. But in actual cases, some are indeed like this. Some people believe and confess that the Lord Jesus is the Savior. They have confessed their sins and have prayed. They say that their sins are forgiven and that they are saved. No matter how hard you try, however, you cannot sense that they are living within. The reason for this is that in preaching the gospel we have not paid attention to the purpose of the gospel. The gospel is not merely to bring forgiveness of sins to people, but to bring them the Lord's life and to enliven them within.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Activity</H2><P>After the elders have trained the brothers and sisters in all the points we have covered, they should begin some gospel activities. They have to conduct gospel meetings in the meeting hall. They have to organize gospel meetings in the homes. They should have some activities in public places. Every day, they should carry gospel tracts with them, and should pass out these tracts in the train stations, the bus stops, and on the bus and the train. These are the gospel activities.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Reaping</H2><P>When the harvest is ripe, there is need for reaping. After the gospel is preached, the saved ones should be brought into the church. There is much to say about this also. Here I can only mention this briefly. After the gospel is preached, there must be the reaping.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Coordination</H2><P>To preach the gospel, there must also be the coordination. Some should be responsible for the message. Some should be responsible for leading the hymns. Some should be responsible for ushering, or to sit with the new ones, or to pass out the tracts. The elders have to help and coordinate all these people together.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Prayer</H2><P>Finally, we have to help the brothers and sisters to pray for all the items we have covered. They should pray for the zeal of the gospel, the power of the gospel, the truth of the gospel, the leading of the gospel, the purpose and the tools of the gospel. They should ask the Lord to bless every Bible and every tract. You can see that simply on prayer alone there are many things in which we need to render help.</P><P>I deeply feel that our prayer meetings have become too general under our leadership. The reason for this is that we do not have specific goals. Sometimes we do not need to pray for so many things. All we need to do is to pray specifically for the targets of the gospel. Here are the schools, the factories, the prisons. We have brothers and sisters working in all these places. We have to pray specifically for these gospel targets. If you do this, you will find that the prayer meeting will come alive, and the prayers will become weighty. These are all works within the elders' management. The elders are the managers. They must be enterprising and must generate business. If you would spend time on these matters, you could find out that there is much to learn on every point. I am only mentioning the points in brief.</P><P>Other than the above, the gospel message, the gospel hymns, the gospel counselling, and the gospel visitation are four important items as well. This means that the elders have to be good in everything. This is why I said that no one can be an elder alone; we have to serve in coordination. Among the elders, there should be some who can preach the gospel. They should train the brothers to learn to give a gospel message, to lead the gospel songs, to give gospel counselling, and to have gospel visitation. All these are part of the helps the elders should render with respect to the gospel. In the management of the church, after the elders have brought the brothers and sisters into the coordination, the first direction they should take is the gospel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Perfecting</H2><P>Perfecting is more troublesome than the preaching of the gospel. No one can say that he has learned or has graduated in this matter. We are all beginners in this school, and there are too many lessons that we have to learn. Just the four stages of the spiritual life alone require much time for training. There are too many points belonging to this direction of perfecting.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Lessons for Beginners</H2><P>Once someone is saved and baptized, the church should give him some beginners' lessons. This will acquaint him with some foundational matters. This must be done by the elders themselves; they cannot wait and depend upon the workers to do it. This is like raising up children at home. The mother has to do the cooking and the washing herself. She cannot expect the restaurant to cook for them and the tailor to make all the clothes for them. In the same way, the elders must take the lead themselves to take care of the beginners' lessons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Consecration</H2><P>The elders must also help the newly-saved ones to pass through the gate of consecration. If many brothers and sisters in your church have never consecrated themselves, this proves that your church has never been managed. Every church that has been helped and perfected will have most of its brothers and sisters consecrated before God. Of course, this is not an easy thing to do. This requires much prayer, and it takes the Holy Spirit to find the opportunity to operate in the hearts of the saints. The consecration of the brothers and sisters must not only be genuine, but must be something living in the Holy Spirit. The elders should consider how much work there is to do in bringing the brothers and sisters genuinely through the gate of consecration!</P><P>Let me repeat. The church needs the management of the elders. It does not need the preaching of famous preachers. Suppose you invite one person to come this week, another person to come next week, and a third person to come the third week. One gives an interesting exposition on Genesis. Another gives an interesting exposition on Revelation. Still another one gives an exposition on Daniel, or on Psalms, which are all very interesting. But by doing this, you have absolutely sacrificed the brothers and sisters. These brothers and sisters have been listening to interesting messages year in and year out. Yet they themselves have not changed. No. For the elders to manage the church, they should behave like parents teaching their children. The children need to go to kindergarten now. I cannot invite a college professor to come and teach them. I do not need that profound an education here. I need only a kindergarten teacher to teach them to count with their fingers. Perhaps after two or three years, I will need an elementary school teacher. After they graduate from elementary school, I will need a high school teacher. I cannot invite a renowned professor to come and lecture any time I want. The professors may speak to their hearts' delight, but the children will not understand anything. In the end, such a thing will only damage them. Suppose I invite Dr. Chang to my house for a lecture today, Dr. Wang for another lecture tomorrow, and Dr. Lin the third day. If I keep on inviting people like this, without sending the children to elementary school, junior high school, and high school, what should the children do when they reach eighteen or twenty years of age? All they can do then is to be a street sweeper. The parents cannot be that foolish. They must know what their children's levels are. I know that the brothers and sisters need to consecrate themselves now. What I need to do is to pray and to seek the Lord, so that all the brothers and sisters can pass through the gate of consecration. This is called church management.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Fellowship</H2><P>After consecration, we have to lead these ones to fellowship with the Lord, to learn to pray, and to study the Word. I really hope that the elders can manage the churches well. Suppose the brothers and sisters here are very poor in the matter of the study of the Word. They do not know how to study, nor do they have the interest to study. The elders here do not know how to help them. You can go to the nearby churches and ask one or two brothers who are especially good at helping others to study the Word to come and help. You can invite them to come for eight or ten days and to speak every day on the way to study the Word. At the same time, you have to take the lead to actually help the brothers and sisters to study the Word. This is something you can do. This is the proper way to manage the church.</P><P>Suppose my child is good in English and general science, but he is weak in mathematics. I will have to hire a mathematics teacher to come and tutor him in mathematics. Perhaps he is not good in chemistry. I will have to invite a chemistry teacher to come and tutor him in chemistry. This is the way to manage a home. The management of the church is in the same principle. You cannot merely give a message on Sunday morning. This will not work. For the elders to manage the church, they have to know at what stage the brothers and sisters are and what kind of things they lack.</P><P>You may say that this is too artificial. Dear brothers and sisters, look at Genesis 1 and 2. There, on the one hand, it says that God created the different kinds of plants and herbs. On the other hand, it says that "every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground" (Gen. 2:5). Here you can see that the sending of the rain is God's work, while the tilling of the ground is man's work. In order to have the produce of life, there is the need for man's work to match God's work.</P><P>We know that here in Taiwan there are two harvests each year. However, there must first be those who till the ground before there can be the harvest. If everyone is looking to the heavens for food, and no one tills, sows, or irrigates, there will surely be no harvest at all. For the heaven to rain, it takes God's grace. For example, last year there was too much rain, and we had a flood. This year, there is too little rain, and we almost have a drought. This is God's work. We have to learn to fear God. However, the cooperation on man's side is indispensable. The apostle Paul said: "You are God's farm, God's building" (1 Cor. 3:9). The building needs someone to build it, and the farm needs someone to till it. You may say that this is artificial. The ones who truly know God's grace are the ones who are truly diligent, and only those who are truly diligent before God know truly what God's grace is. Hence, dear brothers and sisters, you should pray more, look to the Lord more, deal with Him more, and be more diligent. Never think that this way of managing the church is artificial or is an exercise of human manipulation.</P><P>I fully agree that in today's deformed Christianity there is not much prayer, not much dealing before the Lord and not much trust in God. It depends mostly on outward organizations, outward committees, and outward activities. This is, of course, too artificial. But while we are learning today to live before God, to have dealings with Him, and to look to Him, we cannot neglect the outward things that we have to do. The coming of the rain does not take away the need for the tilling of man. You have to endeavor with perseverance and manage with diligence. You have to bring the brothers' and sisters' condition before the Lord and consider them well. You cannot take the easy way. You must have a goal in perfecting them, and you must help them to consecrate, to learn to fellowship with the Lord, to exercise to pray, and to study the Word. This is the proper management.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Experiencing the Cross</H2><P>The elders must also bring the brothers and sisters into the experience of the cross. They need to help the brothers and sisters to see that their old man has already been crucified and terminated. Their carnality, their flesh, temper, disposition, ambition, and aspirations have been terminated on the cross. They can be fleshly elsewhere, but not in the church, because in the church everyone has been crucified. They can be ambitious and have high aspirations elsewhere. But in the church, they can neither have an ambitious heart nor a high aspiration. They are just a pile of ashes, a terminated man on the cross. They can fight for name and fortune in any social organization or covet position. But in the church they are all buried in the grave already. They are all dead and buried ones. Here there is no name or fortune to fight for and no position to covet. You have to help the brothers and sisters to take the cross. Of course, this is a deeper lesson.</P><P>These are the directions in coordination. While you are helping one brother, you may feel that he is good in the gospel, and he is most suitable to take the platform. You have to help him in this area, developing him, encouraging him, perfecting him, and giving him the opportunity to practice. You may not be very good at giving a gospel message. You can introduce him to those who are experienced in this and encourage more contact with them. In this way you will produce one who is good in gospel preaching.</P><P>Many times those who are managing are not necessarily those who can do the things themselves. However, they can get help from those who can do the things. This is church management. In teaching her children, a mother may not necessarily know English or chemistry very well. But she knows when her children need to learn English and chemistry, and she can ask for help. This is the way to manage the church.</P><P>When we spoke about coordination, we emphasized the need for the brothers and sisters to be brought into the coordination. But when we speak about the direction in coordination, we are emphasizing the need for the brothers and sisters to have a definite direction in their coordination. Some will be directed into the aspect of the gospel and others into the aspect of the perfecting. For example, a brother has learned the lesson of the cross. You, as one who manages the church, in bringing him into the coordination, should channel him into the direction of perfecting. He should be brought into a perfecting function; he should learn to pick up the burden and the responsibility to help the other brothers and sisters learn the breaking of the cross. You are an elder, and the authority of the church is in your hand. When you give him the opportunity and the position, he will be perfected. Eventually, this brother will be able to stand up regularly in the church to testify concerning the cross and to release messages on the cross. In three to five months, many brothers and sisters will have learned to take the cross. This is what I mean by the direction in coordination.</P><P>Take another example. Some sisters have learned some very good lessons in fellowshipping with the Lord. The elders should try their best to open up more meetings for these sisters to exercise their function in coordination, so that they can go on in the direction of perfecting others. In the end, even some brothers may get the help from these sisters. Here is a member that has some specialty. The elders should have good management here and should use this specialty well. I believe the brothers and sisters can understand what I mean now.</P><P>I can go on more along this line. But I hope that the elders would have an impression that there are no lofty theories to the elders' management of the church; everything is a matter of practice. If the elders do not practice, there will not be much to do. At most they will need to make some announcements of the regular meetings and to make some decisions regarding the direction of the meetings. To be an elder in this way is too easy. It is a waste to confer on such brothers the title of an elder. There are too many practical things that the elders have to do.</P><P>Suppose the brothers and sisters in your church are cold and not at all zealous in the gospel. You have to stir up something and start a fire. If you do this, right away you will see that there are many things to do.</P><P>Suppose again that there are over a hundred brothers and sisters in your locality, but few read the Bible. Many brothers and sisters do not have the habit of reading the Bible; they do not have the interest in reading the Bible, nor do they receive any light in reading it. What should you do? The elders have to come together and spend a few hours prostrating themselves before the Lord, asking for the Lord's mercy to open up His Word to them and to give the brothers and sisters a desire to love, enjoy, and crave for the Lord's Word. If you do this, you will see that the elders have a lot to do. They will have to put in a lot of effort and energy. But I can tell the brothers and sisters that this is very worthwhile and valuable. It is a glorious work.</P><P>Some people who manage their own homes raise three to five children. The children grow from infancy to kindergarten age. They go from kindergarten to elementary school, and from elementary school all the way to college. When the parents see this, they will be very happy. Dear brothers and sisters, imagine how many children there are in God's house! This managing, shepherding, and teaching responsibility is now commissioned to you. What a glorious work this is. Whenever you see the children of God growing and living before the Lord, how sweet your heart will feel! No wonder the apostle Paul said: "For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting? Are not even you, before our Lord Jesus at His coming? For you are our glory and joy" (1 Thes. 2:19-20). The apostle Peter also said: "And when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, you [the elders serving as the shepherds] will receive the unfading crown of glory" (1 Pet. 5:4). What a glorious work this is!</P><P>Brothers, the way to manage a church is here. Do not expect lofty words and profound wisdom or grand theories. I am here only giving you some basic points, hoping that something better will come out from you. If the brothers would take this little bit of help, they will discover many riches when they put it into practice, and they will learn many practical lessons. After you learn the lesson and have some practical experience, you will not only be able to give the brothers and sisters some practical supply, but you will have the power of discernment. I do hope that the brothers would take this little advice and take this way to manage the church in the days ahead throughout all the churches. I know that the church needs this kind of managing. Where there is such managing, there the church will be on the right track, and there the church will be built up and will be able to meet God's genuine needs in this age. Dear brothers and sisters, the way to build up the church is here.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><P>We will continue to consider the administration of the elders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Knowing Resurrection</H2><P>On the side of perfecting, the fifth point on which the elders have to render help is the knowledge of resurrection. What is resurrection? Resurrection means that God has passed through incarnation, death, and resurrection, and has terminated the fallen elements within man, mingling Himself into man to become man's life, so that the created, fallen, and redeemed man can live in God and take God as life. Resurrection means that a man has reached a stage before God where he lives in Him, takes the Lord as his life, having been led by Him and having some experience, and knows the matter of resurrection. In terms of life, such a person has reached the peak. He is at the pinnacle in life. He is not only saved, and he is not only living a normal Christian life; he is not only consecrated, and he has not only learned the lessons of fellowship and is living in the fellowship, but he is a person who accepts the cross, who is delivered from the old creation, and who has entered into resurrection. He knows what it is to have the created man redeemed by God, to be mingled with God, and to take God as life. When a brother or sister has reached the stage of knowing resurrection, he or she has been brought to God and is living in God and taking God as life. This is the highest peak in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Knowing the Church</H2><P>However, it is not enough to know resurrection alone; a person must also know the church. The reason the elders lead others into the realm of resurrection is to fulfill the goal of knowing the church. God's goal is fully the church. The reason man is brought into God, mingled with Him, takes Him as life, and lives in resurrection, is for the purpose of having the church. The church is the center of God's goal. It is also where God's goal rests. It is here that God's will can be accomplished. Hence, in their administration the elders have to help the brothers and sisters to know the church. Every item of management in this administration is laborious. This is especially true with the knowledge concerning the church. I hope that the elders would not only know this matter themselves, but would bring the brothers and sisters into this knowledge. Now we want to mention eight main points concerning the knowledge of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Position of the Church in God's Plan</H2><P>God's purpose concerning the church must be viewed from eternity, from God's desire and from God's plan, for everything in God's plan is related to the church. In eternity, God had a plan, and this plan is to produce in the universe the church, which comes out of the created beings, the human race. This church is to be His mystical habitation and a Body for His Son. This is the position of the church in God's plan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Nature of the Church</H2><P>The nature of the church is Christ. Just as the nature of a table is wood and the nature of a microphone is metal, so the nature of the church is Christ. Christ Himself is the nature of the church.</P><P>For example, if someone asks you what is the nature of a book, you would answer that its nature is paper. If he brings you some clothes and asks you what is their nature, you would answer that they are made of cloth or of silk. Suppose someone asks you about the nature of the church. The elders must be able to tell right away what the nature of the church is. They have to know it themselves, and they have to help the brothers and sisters to know it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Function of the Church</H2><P>What is the function of the church? The podium here has the nature of wood. The blackboard also has the nature of wood, as does the chair. However, although their nature is the same, their functions are different. The podium is used by people to speak from. The blackboard is used by people to write on. The chair is used by people to sit on. The nature of the church is Christ. But what is the function of the church? In simple terms, it has two functions: on the one hand, it is the Body of Christ, for the expression of Christ. On the other hand, it is the habitation of God, for God to have a dwelling place in the universe, and particularly on earth. These are the God-ordained functions of the church. On the one hand, God wants to express Himself in the universe among His creation. This expression is in His Son and through the church. The church here is the Body of His Son, Christ. As such, it has become a means of God's expression in His Son. A man is expressed through his body. If you take the body away and leave the soul there, there is no way for him to express himself. In the same way, the church is the Body of Christ and the expression of Christ. In other words, it is God's expression in His Son. On the other hand, the church is also the habitation God has secured for Himself in the universe and on earth. The church is the habitation of God. It is God's house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Appearance of the Church</H2><P>The church is something very great. It is something very mysterious yet very practical and tangible. For this reason, the church needs an appearance. This is like the radio waves that pervade over the whole earth and fill all the air space. They are mysterious yet tangible. But in order for the radio waves to become tangible, they must have an appearance. If you install a radio receiver and tune to the right frequency, the radio waves will "appear." The church is a mystery. It includes time and space, yet it also transcends time and space. Nevertheless, at the same time the church has a tangible appearance in the localities. In the Bible, we can find the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, the church in Ephesus, and the church in Corinth. There are the many churches in the different localities. The church has its appearance on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Ground of the Church</H2><P>We should not only know the position of the church in God's plan, its nature, its function, and its appearance; we must also know the ground of the church. If the brothers and sisters know this, wherever they go, they will be able to discern under what kind of condition a place is a church.</P><P>Today's Christianity is too confusing. Men can put up a sign everywhere and call themselves the church. If the brothers and sisters have been taught, they will not be deceived by this kind of device. They will have the clear discernment to know what is the church. Hence, the ground of the church is also a big issue.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The History and Present Condition of the Church</H2><P>We must also know all that the church has passed through from Pentecost until now. We have to know a general sketch of what the church has passed through, and we have to know the present condition of the church. We have to tell the brothers and sisters what the Roman Catholic Church is and what Protestantism is. We have to let them know what the different denominations, sects, and groups are, and what the church is that God is after on earth. We have to acquaint the brothers and sisters with the history and the present condition of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Recovery of the Church</H2><P>While you are helping the brothers and sisters to know the history and the present condition of the church, they will see that the church today has fully departed from the condition at the beginning. However, God has a recovery. The recovery of the church is a big subject. You can begin from the recovery of Martin Luther, and consider how the pioneers of the Reformation four or five hundred years ago began the recovery, and how the recovery came down through the ages, through Zinzendorf, then the British Brethren, until it reached the East, and how God recovered His church. You need time to dig out the background material concerning all these. You yourselves have to know these things, and you have to help the brothers and sisters to know these things also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Building Up of the Church</H2><P>Finally, they have to know about the building up of the church. This is another big subject. In order to perfect the brothers and sisters and to help them to know something concerning the church, at least we have to have these eight points. None of them can be missing. Even if the elders cannot do the job themselves, they have to ask others to help them. If we are knowledgeable in these eight things, how widespread will God's work become on the earth, and how strong will His testimony be among us!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Knowing the Body</H2><P>It seems that knowing the church is the same as knowing the Body, but actually there is a difference. Knowing the church emphasizes the organizational aspect, whereas knowing the Body emphasizes the spiritual aspect. The church has these two aspects, in the same way that a man has two aspects, the body and the soul. A strong man must be strong in both aspects, the body and the soul. The same is true with the church. The church has its organizational aspect and its spiritual aspect as well. On the organizational side, the church is the "ekklesia"; it is the congregation of the called-out ones. On the spiritual side, the church is a body. We must not only help the brothers and sisters to understand the nature, the function, the appearance, the ground, the history, the present condition, the recovery, and the building up of the church, but we must help them to understand that the church is an organism and a body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Life of the Body</H2><P>We have to help the brothers and sisters to know that the life within the Body, the church, is Christ. This requires some who have a special ministry to do this work. Let me say a word in passing: I hope that among us those full-time brothers who are taking more responsibilities in the work would pick up the burden and stretch forth the hand of faith to ask for this kind of gift and would do more specific works among the churches. It is a special work to help the brothers and sisters to know the life in the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Position of the Body</H2><P>The position of the Body is in resurrection and in ascension. The Body of Christ is in resurrection, and it stands on the ground of ascension. Here, death cannot touch it, and all earthly people, matters, and activities are under its feet. Organizationally speaking, the church appears in the different localities. But spiritually speaking, the church is in resurrection and in the realm of ascension. It does not belong to the earth, and it is not on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Coordination of the Body</H2><P>The brothers and sisters must be led to know that they themselves are the members and that they are fellow members with other saints in the Body of Christ. This is different from their being in the house of God. In the house of God, you yourself are a single unit, because you are a brother or a sister. But in the Body of Christ, you cannot be isolated; you cannot become a unit, for you are just a member. A child in a family may go away for three months. He may not be able to live properly, but he can survive. But can your eyes go away for three months? Suppose your eyes say that they do not like to be in the body, in the same way that children say that they do not like to stay at home. It is impossible for your eyes to go away for three seconds, much less three months. Once a member goes away from the body, it is finished. We have to show the brothers and sisters that we are members, and that we cannot be isolated. Hence, we have to learn to coordinate with others and to be members one of another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Feeling of the Body</H2><P>The feeling of the Body is a very fine feeling. It is a feeling that comes from the operation of the Holy Spirit in the Body of Christ. In our physical body there are the nerve fibers. All the feelings in the body are derived from the nerve fibers. Once the nerve fibers are cut off, the feelings will be stopped and gone. The Holy Spirit is the nerve fiber in the Body of Christ. The more we give the Holy Spirit the ground, the more sensitive will the feeling of the Body become.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Living in the Body</H2><P>The living in the Body means to bring the brothers and sisters to live in the Body. A person should not be individualistic in his work and his service. But even more, he should not be individualistic in his living. He has to keep the principle of the Body. Not only do we work and serve with the brothers and sisters in coordination, but we live in coordination as well.</P><P>If you can do a good job in both aspects, the knowledge of the church and the knowledge of the Body, the church where you are will be a built-up habitation to God. To Christ, it will be a coordinated Body. In other words, you will have made the brothers and sisters the habitation of God and the Body of Christ. Of course, this requires much time for such a management.</P><P>Let me repeat. It is not so simple a thing to manage a church. You have to learn everything. For example, if you want to manage a home, not only do you have to learn to wash your clothes and cook your meals; strictly speaking, you even have to learn the way to put flowers in a vase. Sometimes we spend a considerable amount of money to buy some flowers, only to arrange them in a disorderly way. Moreover, we do not know how to keep them alive, and in two days they all wilt. But a person who has learned to arrange flowers will need to spend only a little money for flowers. They may not even need to spend any money, but cut some flowers from their yard and arrange them in a vase, and the flowers will look quite nice and will stay alive for a long time. Never think that anybody can arrange some flowers. It is not so simple. Never think that anybody can manage a church either. No, there is a difference between one kind of managing and another kind of managing. There are too many things to learn here.</P><P>If the church where you are has been properly managed, once it preaches the gospel, others will be able to tell that the preaching here is different, that it is the result of training, and that it is not wild. This is like the arrangement of flowers. If you have learned the art of flower arrangement, and I walk into your home, I will be able to tell right away that your flowers are not arranged in an ordinary way, but they are arranged as a result of training.</P><P>Some time ago, some brothers in Southeast Asia heard that we baptized a few hundred people at a time in Taipei. They wondered how we could have done it. They said that for them to baptize ten or twenty people alone would throw the meeting hall into disorder and their people into chaos. No doubt, I have seen that in some places confusion begins once their baptism begins, and that the confusion is over when their baptism is over. If a matter as small as a baptism is so disorganized in administration, how can the church be clear in the big matters? This will be like having no management at all. If a church is properly managed, once there is confusion in the baptism, a gathering will be held the next day to study the reason for the confusion and the way to overcome it. This is the way to manage the church.</P><P>Church management requires labor with perseverance. No one endeavoring in a factory, a business, or an enterprise can succeed easily. If a person loses money in a business deal, he will surely not be able to sleep well. He will surely study hard and try to change his method the next time. But the church has been running a losing business for a long time. The first time there was a gospel meeting, fifteen or sixteen were baptized. The next time there were twelve or thirteen. One more time and there are only eight or nine. The number becomes smaller and smaller. Where is the problem? In order to manage well, you must change.</P><P>The housewives who manage their houses know that no one can substitute for them in the housework. They have to do everything themselves. If the piano has broken down and they do not know how to fix it, they can call in the experts to fix it. However, whether or not to fix it still must be decided by them; no one else can decide for them. The same is true with the management of the church. You have to do everything yourself.</P><P>Some are prejudiced to think that as long as they know a little bit of the truth and teach the brothers a little bit of the truth, everything will be all right. But you have to see that this is only one part of the job. The church is a home and a body. Not only does it need vitamin A, but it needs all kinds of vitamins as well. The Body needs all kinds of supply. The eyes have their needs. The ears have their needs. The nose has its need. There are all kinds of needs. Thank God that He has given you a portion of grace and a commission, but you should not be satisfied with what you have. It is very important that some have learned some spiritual lessons, but the needs of the church are varied. You have to give others a place and a chance to minister their portion. No one can meet the needs of the church by himself. There is the need for multifaceted management.</P><P>This is like a home. The needs there are varied. Someone has to cook in the kitchen. Some have to do the laundry. The older children have to do some work. The younger ones have to go to school. Only the youngest ones play. There is the need for electrical maintenance, tailoring, and gardening. This is only a small illustration. To manage a church, a person has to be broad in his heart and farsighted in his view. He has to see that this is not his work; this is the house of God. If it is only my work, I can work by myself alone. But this is the house of God, the Body of Christ. As such, there is the need for all kinds of management. In church history, the mystics have no descendants. This is because they paid too much attention to the individual pursuit; they did not see the church. No matter how much we love the Lord, how zealous and spiritual we are, no one can replace the church. What God is after today is the church, not individuals.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Service</H2><P>We have previously spoken of three directions in the management of the church into which the elders are to lead the brothers and sisters. The first is the gospel. The second is the perfecting, and the third is the service. The more the brothers and sisters are properly led, the more they should know how to preach the gospel, how to grow spiritually, and how to serve in a living and strong way. We can judge whether or not a local church has been properly managed by these three aspects. Suppose the brothers and sisters are properly trained in the gospel preaching, and there are different degrees of spiritual condition among them, some being newly saved and some beginning to be helped along; some are passing through their crisis of consecration, some are quite mature and know the cross and the resurrection, and some know the church and see the Body. You should be very happy if you see something like this. The church in this place has been quite perfected in life already. Moreover, if the service is somewhat living, strong, regulated, and effective, you can be sure that the management in this church is quite strong. If a local church is indifferent to the gospel, not well-defined in its spiritual condition, and mundane in its service, such a church is surely lacking in management. In helping the brothers and sisters, and in managing the church, we have to keep these three directions as our goal all the time.</P><P>Of the three directions mentioned, the gospel is the easiest, the perfecting is deeper, and the service is the most troublesome. However, much of the gospel and the perfecting is included in the service. In other words, if the direction in the service is not proper, it will be difficult for the gospel and the perfecting to be carried out properly. The service is the consummation of the other two. Hence, it is the most troublesome item of all. To put it in another way, if we subtract from the gospel the spiritual elements, what is left is the service. The way to pass out the gospel tracts, the arrangement for the place to preach the gospel, the way to make the invitations, to have the ushering, to sit with the new ones, to counsel, and the persons to be responsible for the jobs, are all part of the service. The same is true with the perfecting; there are many elements that are included in the service.</P><P>Before 1940, the messages we preached in northern China were quite spiritual. But during that period, not many people were produced, because there was no proper management. From 1940 to 1943, although there was not much preaching, we produced the people. We spent three-quarters of our time on management. Some churches today are strong in the ministry of the Word, yet their church is not proper. It is like having a great soul without a body. In some other churches, the ministry of the Word is not strong. However, its management is very strong. As a result, the church is strong. This does not mean that we do not need the ministry of the Word. It means that it is not enough just to have the soul; we must have the body to match it before the person can be strong. The management of the church is something very important.</P><P>The epistles of the apostle Paul are clearly divided into two categories. The first one is from the book of Romans to 2 Thessalonians, which can be compared to the soul of the church; it deals with the spiritual aspect of the church. The three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus belong to another category; they specialize in the organization of the church. They tell us who are qualified to be elders and deacons, how to handle matters, and how to behave in the house of God. This is what we call management. Unfortunately, when Bible readers talk about the church, they always refer to the spiritual aspect and neglect the management of the church. They circle around the first category and neglect the teaching in the three books of the Timothys and Titus. If a man dies, it is not because he is weak in soul, but because he is weak in body. The same is true with the church. No matter how many spiritual messages there are, if the management is lacking, the church cannot help but be weak. This is a law.</P><P>Brothers, thirty years ago, we all had the inaccurate concept that once we become spiritual, all of our problems will be solved. However, with the passing of time, we discovered that there is no such thing. It is important to be spiritual, but management is also necessary. Spirituality alone cannot solve all of the problems, just as the soul is not the whole man. Sometimes, I hate my body and think that it is very troublesome; when I eat too little, I feel hungry; when I eat too much, I feel too full; when I do not receive enough nutrition, my body cannot hold itself up. When I wear too many clothes, I sweat; when I wear too little, I catch a cold. It is really difficult to minister to the body, but I am obliged to take care of it, because if my body fails, all else is vain. This is also true with the church. From the book of Romans to 2 Thessalonians, it is a matter of life, and from 1 Timothy to Titus, it is a matter of management. If the body is not in good health, it is of no use to be spiritual. No matter how intellectual you are or how much education you have, when the body is dead, everything is finished. In the same principle, the church has its need on the spiritual side, and it also has its needs on the management side.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Establishment of the Church</H2><P>In the direction of service, the first thing we have to do is to teach the brothers and sisters the way the church is established. If they are edified in this way, when they are led to move to a new locality, they will know how to cooperate with the Lord in establishing a church. Some brothers and sisters have been saved for many years, yet they still do not know by what way the church is produced. They grow up in the family, yet they do not know the genealogy and the history of the family. The reason for this is that they lack the spiritual education.</P><P>The Bible shows us that when the apostles go out to preach the gospel and some are saved, the apostle will establish a church. This is not the quick way. The quick way is for the saints to go to a place and to bring the church to that place. The saints bring the gospel with them. Wherever they go, the gospel is spread, and people are saved. When the saved ones come together to worship the Lord and to allow the Lord to gain the ground among them for the spreading of His work, the church is established.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELDERS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><P>Today we will continue to see the second point concerning service.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Coordination of Business Affairs</H2><P>As soon as a church is established, immediately it should have meetings, gospel activities, and visitation of the saints. All these are the most basic items of service. Hence, arrangement on the side of business affairs is inevitable. As soon as there is service, there is immediately the need of arrangement for business matters. For example, in order to have meetings, there is the need to prepare seats. With the seats, there is the need of cleaning and arranging them before the meeting. In this way, you can see that many affairs will come one after the other. Now we want to consider the principle of handling these business affairs.</P><P>Some churches were established by the workers. Initially, the responsibility fell on the workers, and gradually the elders were set up. Some places began with brothers migrating to a place and settling down there. Gradually, the Lord raised up the church through them. With these, the initial responsibility, of course, fell on the shoulders of these brothers. After that, their service became more and more manifested and well-structured, and some co-workers began to go there to set up the elders according to the actual situation there. No matter by what way the church began, the principle for handling business affairs is the same.</P><P>This principle is that in arranging business affairs, you should never bring in the way of democracy where everyone discusses and expresses their opinions, and where eventually the opinion of the majority is taken and the decision made. This is the worldly way, and it is different from the teaching and example in the Bible. On the other hand, you cannot be autocratic; you cannot take the lead by yourself alone, with everything determined and decided by you and carried out by you. This is equally unscriptural. The principle of administration in the Bible has to do with the Holy Spirit in the Church.</P><P>If a church is raised up in a certain place and the situation there is normal, the Holy Spirit will certainly be there. Without the Holy Spirit, the establishment of the church there will have problems. If we recognize that the church is there, then we ought to also believe and to solemnly recognize that the Holy Spirit is among them. In worldly politics or social organizations, there are only human beings without the Holy Spirit. Ancient politics was a matter of autocratic, sovereign kingship, whereas contemporary politics tends toward democracy. However, there is no Holy Spirit in either autocracy or democracy. The administration in the Church is of the Holy Spirit. With the Holy Spirit, there is neither autocracy nor democracy.</P><P>With the Holy Spirit, there is a matter of degree in life. We cannot deny that the Holy Spirit is with the saints to the degree governed by each one's measure in life. If the degree of life is higher, the presence of the Holy Spirit is also higher; if the degree of the life is lower, the presence of the Holy Spirit is also lower. The measure and intensity of the presence of the Holy Spirit, and whether it is manifested or not, altogether depend on the degree of life. Of course, this has a lot to do with a person's actual condition before the Lord. It may be that your degree of life is quite deep and quite high, and you are quite experienced, but your present condition before the Lord is somewhat off, and your fellowship with the Lord is not very good, even somewhat weak. All these will affect the presence of the Holy Spirit. We can see this in Peter in Galatians 2 and Acts 15. Peter had the highest attainment in life among the brothers; however, in Galatians 2 we see Peter with some weakness. He had become weak. He had mixed up the gospel with the law and had confused the truth of the gospel. Hence in 2:9, it says, "James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars...." It mentions James first, then Cephas (who was Peter). It was quite evident that at that time Peter had fallen behind.</P><P>In Acts 15, the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem were discussing the problem of the Gentiles keeping the law. After much discussion, Peter stood up to speak a word. Then Barnabas and Paul stood up again to describe the miracles and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. After they were silent, James came forth to make the final judgment. This means that James was there being the leading authority. He allowed Peter to speak, and he let Barnabas and Paul testify; in the end, he stood up and said, "Men, brothers, listen to me." In this way, they made the decision and wrote and said that the Holy Spirit and they had made the decision. This is a situation which you cannot find in the world; it is neither democracy nor autocracy. What you have here is the Holy Spirit.</P><P>The presence of the Holy Spirit is according to the degree of life in a person. It is also according to the spiritual condition of a person before God at that time. This presence of the Holy Spirit is the authority for judgment in the Church. The degree of life in Peter was higher than that in James, yet at this time, Peter had a little weakness. Among them, James' condition before God was the most proper; hence, the leading authority and the final deciding authority fell on James. When they thus made the decision, they could say that this was made by the Holy Spirit and them together. This was not the opinion of all the people, nor one man's suggestion; it was the operation of the Holy Spirit. However, the operation of the Holy Spirit is according to the degree of life and man's condition before God.</P><P>Therefore, when a local church is raised up, naturally those who have a higher degree of life will become the leading ones there. These brothers cannot call a corporate conference whenever they encounter some business problems. If so, man's opinions will definitely come in, and the authority of the Holy Spirit will be sacrificed.</P><P>Suppose there are thirty brothers and sisters here, and only five or six are somewhat higher in life, whose condition before the Lord is somewhat more normal. The rest of the twenty or more are all newly saved, and their spiritual condition is very young; they do not even know what is spiritual and what is fleshly. If we were to ask everyone to express his opinion and to cast his vote, surely four-fifths of them would cast a fleshly vote and one fifth, a spiritual vote. The system of voting brings in man's flesh and cuts off the authority of the Holy Spirit. Hence, we can never adopt the system of voting. On the other hand, the Bible does not allow one leading brother to make decisions by himself either. In the Bible there is no autocracy; there is only the meeting together of the experienced, spiritual, and elderly ones.</P><P>If a church has just started and there are no elders appointed yet, the principle is still the same. Among the brothers and sisters, a few who are more elderly, who love the Lord more, and who are more spiritual should come together for fellowship. You should give the opportunity for everyone to speak up concerning their feelings. You as a leading one should listen, on the one hand, and look to the Holy Spirit, on the other hand, to give you the discernment. With one brother's word, there may be the personal view and the fleshly element. With another's word, there is a certain amount of godliness and conformity to the Lord's will. After they have expressed their feelings in this way, you need to make a decision. You should not have everyone cast a vote. You need to cause the brothers and sisters to realize that here is the authority of the Holy Spirit, and that this is not a democracy. It is everyone expressing the feeling of the Holy Spirit before the Lord, and the authority of the Holy Spirit making the decision. If the brothers would hold fast this principle, under such circumstances you will see the evident presence of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Many times you may be foolish under other circumstances; but under such circumstances and in this kind of condition, you become very clear within. As soon as a person opens his mouth, the Holy Spirit will give you a clear sense within. You will know clearly whether there is still the flesh within a certain person, whether there is still the element of emotion in him, and whether his opinion is right and can be taken. You may have never thought about these things before. At such times, you should exercise the authority and should make the decision. This is neither democracy nor autocracy, but the Holy Spirit being in the Church the authority manifested through the more elderly ones who live before the Lord.</P><P>In the church there are always a few who have more fear toward the Lord, who live before Him, know Him, and have discernment concerning spiritual things. These should seek the mind of the Holy Spirit concerning the affairs of the church and should make decisions about them. If the meeting in a place is indeed one raised up by the Lord, we should believe that even though the leading brothers may be somewhat immature, there will be the special presence of the Lord.</P><P>This is the way we began our meeting in northern China years ago. At that time, I was a leading one. But I had never passed through any training and had never experienced any meeting of such a kind. However, under the leading of the Holy Spirit, I was neither democratic nor autocratic. When matters rose up, I would fellowship with a few brothers and sisters who loved the Lord. We would talk the matter over and over before the Lord. We weighed the pros and the cons, and then made the decision to do things a certain way. Gradually after nearly ten years, we began to see the light in the Bible concerning the administration of the Church, and we realized that this was indeed the right way. It is neither a democracy nor an autocracy.</P><P>	The record in Acts 15 concerning the decision by James was indeed beautiful. Verse 13 says, "And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me." This is true authority. He did not say, "Listen to me; I think it should be decided this way." If it had been like this, it would have been an autocracy. Instead, he mentioned how Simeon described this and that; he brought in others' feelings as the basis. Following this, he continued by saying that the words of the prophets also agree with this; he looked for the confirmation of the Scripture. Finally he concluded, "Wherefore I judge..." This is the word of authority. It was here that the matter was decided. It was neither an autocracy nor a democracy; it was altogether a decision of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>In the church, every time you encounter some business arrangements, you need to lay hold of this principle of handling matters. Even with purely business matters, you need to keep this principle. Suppose you are starting a meeting, and you need to make some chairs. You cannot call all thirty brothers and sisters together to have a conference on chairs. If you do this, it would be terrible; the church would become a social organization, and the authority of the Holy Spirit would be completely sacrificed. You need to find a few brothers who somewhat love the Lord and who have some better understanding of business affairs; you should contact them, ask for their viewpoints, and take up their opinions. After this, you should ask a few leading brothers and sisters to come for some fellowship. If you fear the Lord in your heart, and you are without any personal opinion, and if you are not autocratic, but allow the Holy Spirit to exercise His rule, the Holy Spirit will give you wisdom and will show you the best way even in matters like making chairs. By that time you can make a decision and can say to the brothers: "Of all the ways, Brother So-and-so's way is the best. Let us adopt that brother's way." This is the principle of handling business affairs.</P><P>Unfortunately, in some of the churches there is either a tendency toward autocracy or democracy. Under both of these situations, the Holy Spirit has no authority; as a result, the management of the church becomes a big problem. In the church, the Holy Spirit manifests His authority through some brothers and sisters who are more advanced. Once the brothers have acknowledged this principle, it can be applied to every matter. As to how to do the things and what to do, you need to first pray before the Lord yourself. Suppose you have already started meeting here. What kind of meetings should you have during the week? You as a leading responsible one should first pray before the Lord and touch His feeling. Then you should seek out a few among the brothers and sisters who love the Lord, and who are spiritual, to come together for fellowship and to listen to their feelings. At this time, the Holy Spirit will give you a judgment, and you will say, "Brothers, it is quite clear; we should have the Lord's table meeting once a week, prayer once a week, and also we should preach the gospel in a certain brother's house." All the business affairs in the church should be decided this way.</P><P>Once there are business affairs, there is the problem with people. You are starting a meeting now. Who is going to be responsible for arranging the chairs? Who is going to be responsible for cleaning? The principle is still the same. You cannot call a conference to vote; neither can you make the decision yourself. You must ask a few brothers and sisters to come to have a talk, and you must listen to their feelings. During the conversation, you will be clear within and will delegate the matters to those whom the Lord has confirmed. Not only so, even the way to clean and arrange needs to be fellowshipped among a few before handing these matters over to the responsible ones. This is a basic principle. If we have adequate fear of the Lord, under this principle and according to our spiritual level, the Holy Spirit will gain the proper ground among us.</P><P>In the arranging of these business affairs, the managing ones need to continue to have ideas. Now that a church is raised up, what kind of activities should it have? In which direction should it develop? They need to bring all these matters before the Lord, to pray and to look to Him. But ideas are merely the beginning; when a decision is to be made, you still need to follow the same principle; you need to ask a few brothers and sisters to come and discuss. You may say to them: "Brothers, these days I have a sense before the Lord that just to have prayer meetings and the Lord's table meetings are not adequate. We still do not know the Bible well enough, nor are we very clear about the truths. We should consider whether we need to have a Bible study meeting." It is in this way that you make a decision about a Bible study meeting, or maybe even an additional message meeting.</P><P>Perhaps after not too long a time, because of the Lord's presence, the number in your meeting gradually increases. There is not enough room for everyone; people begin to sit outside in the courtyard. By that time, you as a leading one need to come up with some ideas immediately. Perhaps you can pray to the Lord, saying, "Lord, is the brother's living room no longer adequate for our meeting? Should we rent a meeting hall or buy a piece of land to build a meeting hall ourselves?" After you have prayed this way to the Lord, you should still apply the same principle in making your decision. You need to ask the elderly saints to come together and talk about it. During the conversation, the Holy Spirit will show you whether you should rent a place or buy a piece of land, or whether you should rent while at the same time you look for land on which to build a hall. After you have become clear and have arrived at a decision, at the next Lord's table meeting you can make the announcement. If you can always keep this principle and follow the Holy Spirit to come up with ideas, it will be the most beautiful thing.</P><P>In managing the church, one of the worst things that can happen to the elders is to be unable to follow the Holy Spirit to come up with ideas. The reason that a person cannot catch up with the leading of the Holy Spirit is due either to his laziness or to his fear of problems. Sometimes a brother who loves the Lord may come to you and say, "Brother, look! Our meeting now has more than seventy people. I am afraid that this living room is not adequate." But you reply, saying, "Brother, you still have to go to teach, and I still have to go to work. Why don't we just let things get by like that!" In the New Testament, the symbol of the Holy Spirit is a dove, not a tiger. If you are just a little fearful of problems, the Holy Spirit will fly away. But if you would joyfully pray, saying, "Lord, even if I have to sleep a little less and labor a little more, I am still willing; here is a need: should we prepare a meeting hall or not?" right away you will have a feeling within urging you. If you will then invite some spiritual brothers and sisters to fellowship together, to sense the feeling of the Holy Spirit, to allow the Holy Spirit to exercise His authority, and to endeavor in this way, the Holy Spirit will take you on. If you would endeavor according to the Holy Spirit, He will come all the time to look for you.</P><P>In this endeavoring, the Holy Spirit may come to you one day and show you that among the one hundred or so brothers and sisters, a good number of families have children. Should there not be a children's meeting for them? You will then go again before the Lord to pray, and within you there will be the urging again. Still you need to follow the same principle to make a decision. Once you have a children's meeting, the location becomes a problem; the chairs and the responsible ones also become problems. As soon as you have an idea, right away many troubles come along.</P><P>If you are willing to labor, the work will be blessed by the Lord, and the number will increase continually. Right away you need to come up with new ideas again, such as building a meeting hall, subdividing into districts, and establishing responsible ones for the districts and the groups. Many troublesome matters will follow. Also, from this kind of endeavoring the three major items of service will be produced. Since there are so many coming to the meetings, and so many matters to take care of, there needs to be a business office. After you have come up with the idea of a business office, you also need to come up with ideas on what to do, who should take care of the things, and how to take care of the things. Only then will you be able to meet the need of the three major items of service. You can imagine how much energy it requires!</P><P>In 1950 in Taipei, when I was discussing with another brother the guidelines related to the business office, we came up with at least a few hundred items. To take care of matters properly, to match the need of the three items of service, and to cooperate with the need of the meetings, and, on top of that, to be spiritual, and to have people edified once they enter the business office, this is not something that can be achieved with two or three words. The elders must labor continually and arrange everything with their own hands. Otherwise, with a large local church, not to say one with three or five thousand in attendance, even one with three to five hundred in attendance, it will not be easy to carry out the service. Not only will the service not be easy to carry out, but it will be impossible to produce new ones to come into the service. The reason for this is that there will be no opportunity for them to come in to learn to serve. Therefore, you have to manage to a point where all the services are continually turning, with the new ones turning toward the services all the time. The more people are saved, the more districts there will be; the more districts, the more business affairs there will be; the more business affairs, the more responsible ones and serving ones there will be. In this way, the whole thing will keep on turning. Here in Taipei, we have turned out thirty-four districts and one hundred eighty district responsible ones. If these one hundred eighty brothers and sisters would be like what was just described, and if they would endeavor according to the Holy Spirit in all the districts, I believe in five years there will surely be more than one hundred districts. By that time, just the responsible ones for the districts alone will come up to five or six hundred. You should not worry whether the Lord will bless; the question is who will coordinate with Him. The principle of the Holy Spirit is always for the heavens to send the rain and for man to till the ground. The question is who is going to till the ground and how to till it. There is a lot involved in the question of the person tilling the ground and the way to till it. All these have to do with the business arrangements in the services.</P><P>If you would continue to come up with ideas, gradually you will see that Taipei is a center of education. Among these many high schools and universities, there are countless high school students and college students. How can you bring the gospel in among them through the brothers and sisters who are students? This is a big business. You can imagine how many things, matters, and persons you would need to carry out this task. After laboring this way for one to two years, at least one or two hundred young people will be gained by the Lord. This kind of effect and the future result cannot be estimated. The church grows up in this way; it is coordinated and built up in this way.</P><P>Under this kind of management, everyone will fear God, everyone will have a godly living, and everyone will live in the Holy Spirit. If so, can the church be without the Lord's presence? What limit will there be to the blessing? Furthermore, this unlimited blessing will cause these responsible ones to endeavor more. Like the northerners playing with snowballs, the more they roll, the faster and bigger the snowballs become. Due to human limitation, sometimes the snowball may stop for a while. However, after the responsible ones learn some more deeper lessons before the Lord and are dealt with more, new activities will begin, and the snowball will roll again.</P><P>As far as being a human being, a person needs to be educated and to learn the skills. However, when he has his own family, he needs to learn to manage his home. The same is true with the church. Besides pursuing spirituality individually, preaching the gospel, and taking care of people, if you are concerned for God's heart, and desire to be useful in God's hand, you must also pursue the way to manage the church. If you want your spirituality to have a direction, your fellowship with the Lord to be useful, your preaching of the gospel to have an issue, your care of the saints to have a result, you need to realize that all these hinge upon the management of the church. Short of proper church management, all these will fall apart and become disintegrated. As soon as there is management in the church, all these will be coordinated together and will produce an integrated, solid, and useful church. Therefore, I hope that the elders would labor more on the matter of management. This is the present urgent need of the church.</P></body></html>
