   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEGETTING TO BEAR FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the organic building up of the Body of Christ we first need to beget others, to bear fruit 1 Cor 4:15; John 15:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 15 the Lord likened Himself with all the members of His Body to a vine tree with its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We the believers are the branches of Christ, the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This tree is for reproducing and for increasing by its branches bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The branches of the tree bearing fruit is not by the way of addition but by the way of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the vine tree bears fruit, it bears clusters of grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That is the issue of the rich flow of life from within.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The fruit is not something just attached or added but something begotten by the outflow of the life from within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord said in John 15:16 that He chose us and appointed us to go forth and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has chosen us and He has appointed us to go forth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What does go forth mean?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This simply means you have to go to reach people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We go forth to beget people so that they become our fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 Corinthians 4:15 Paul said to the Corinthians, For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Paul begot them through the gospel of Christ, he was their father, and they were the fruit of the vine tree brought forth by him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to realize that the preaching of the gospel to save sinners is the dispensing of the very elements of Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To minister, to dispense, the riches of Christ into people is the real and actual preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul said that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The gospel Paul preached was the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not preach mere doctrine or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He preached Christ Himself as the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To minister Christ as life into others we must be very living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A withering, dying branch cannot bring forth any fruit because there is not much life within.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be the fruit-bearing branches of Christ, we must be living by the riches of Christ, which we will minister, impart, or dispense to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our preaching is to minister a living One, the life-giving Spirit, into others so that others may have the same life that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what it means to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the fruit which we bring forth will be attached to Christ, or grafted into Christ, organically.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To bear fruit is the initial step for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we all have to bear such a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are branches of Christ, and as branches we all have the duty to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord told us clearly that if we do not bear fruit we will be cut off from the vine tree John 15:2a, 6a .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not mean that we will perish but that we will lose the rich enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Branches that have been cut off from the tree lose the riches of the tree as their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is quite serious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to bear fruit, we must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult for branches to bear fruit if they are very old.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is easy for the new branches to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our recent past in the Lord s recovery, we did not have much increase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that we had become old and that we were not so fresh or new.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Regardless of how many years we have been Christians, we have to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to be new and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The way to be new is to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a brother who is only sixteen years old does not contact the Lord for a period of time, he will become old.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once we contact the Lord, we will become fresh and new.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After we contact the Lord, it will be easy for us to reach people in our freshness and newness to bring forth fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that this fellowship will help us to realize our need to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we are too old because we have been Christians for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regardless of how many years we have been in Christ, we still need to be rich, new, and fresh to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now I would like to give some practical suggestions concerning how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Throughout church history, many good saints preached the gospel by knocking on people s doors.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Knocking on doors is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Knocking on doors is for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before going out to preach the gospel, it is profitable to consider whom you should go to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You have to consider first your in-laws and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may have been in the Lord for many years, yet still there are people in your family who remain unbelieving.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A principle is set up in Acts 1:8 where the Lord charged the disciples to evangelize first Jerusalem, then Judea, then Samaria, and then the remotest part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to start our preaching of the gospel from the center to those who are closest to us, that is, to our in-laws and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We owe the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First, we have to knock on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then we can consider our friends, our colleagues, our classmates, and our neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our friends who get saved also have their in-laws, relatives, friends, colleagues, classmates, and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way the gospel will be spread through personal contacts.</S>
