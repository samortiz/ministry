<h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Then what is being godly? First Timothy 3:16 says, "And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh..." Godliness is God being manifested in the flesh. This means that God is expressed through man. God's life was manifested in the Lord Jesus (the Head of the church). In the same way, His life is manifested in those who believe in Him (the church). Hence, godliness is simply God's life in us being manifested through our flesh. If we are saved to the extent that our thoughts, words, actions, and attitudes no longer reflect our self but become the living of Christ, we are living a life of godliness. This is what God requires from us. He wants to extend the manifestation of God in the flesh through us.</p><p>Second Timothy 3:12 mentions "to live godly..." This means that we should be godly in our living, so that others will see God. The way we speak should make others feel the presence of God. The way we walk and act should make others feel the presence of God. Even our attire, the furniture in our house, the decor of our dwelling, and our whole living should give others the impression of God. When we contact others, they should sense God in us. This is being godly.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is hard to find even a few among a hundred Christians who live in a godly way. We often find many brothers and sisters who are ungirded in their loins and undisciplined in their mouths. They joke with each other and jest without having any feeling at all. They privately indulge in drinking and gambling without any sense of remorse within. This is because many so-called Christians do not know the meaning of godliness. Consequently, they do not have a godly living. Having the form of godliness, while denying its power, is vain. But one who has the power of godliness will surely not be void of the form of godliness. Godliness originates from God's life. The essence of God's life is godliness. When this life is manifested in us, the result is surely godliness. The trouble with man is that he is full of the self; he is still fleshly. As a result, the life of godliness is frustrated from expressing itself freely. If a Christian does not have any sense of godliness, he is either void of life or living in darkness. As long as a Christian is living in the light, he will always have consciousness within, although the degree of consciousness may vary. If he thinks, speaks, and acts according to an inward consciousness of godliness, he will become a godly man. This is why one has to exercise himself unto godliness.</p><p>First Timothy 4:7 says, "But the profane and old-womanish myths refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness." This shows that the exercise of godliness is very related to the bridling of our words. Careless words are a sure sign of ungodliness. We should be living and fresh, but we must allow God to express Himself through our speaking. Titus 2:12 says, "Training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts..." Godliness is not a question of the heart; it is a way of life. Godliness is God being manifested in us.</p><p>Let me repeat again. What is fear? It is a condition of the heart; it is being afraid of the presence of the self in everything and constantly being in fear of offending God. What is godliness? Godliness is a way of living; it is expressing God in our daily living. The principle of God's work is always from the inside to the outside. If a man only pays attention to the form of godliness without caring for the life of godliness, his conduct is just a performance without the power and reality of godliness. There is genuine godliness when a person, in a fearful way, becomes apprehensive of his self-activity and constantly refuses, opposes, and condemns all ungodly thoughts, words, acts, moves, and attitudes to the extent that he becomes restricted in his outward behavior. When he moves away from this restriction, he becomes uneasy within; he is condemned and no longer at peace within. We must learn to fear and exercise ourselves unto godliness. May the Lord have a way among us.</p>
