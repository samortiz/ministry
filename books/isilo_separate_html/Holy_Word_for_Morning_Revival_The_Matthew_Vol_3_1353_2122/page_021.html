And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?</p><p class="bold">26 &nbsp;And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the <sup>1</sup>sons are free.</p> <p class="bold">27 &nbsp;But that we do not stumble them, <sup>1</sup>go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a <sup>2</sup>stater; take that and <sup>3</sup>give it to them for Me <sup>4</sup>and you.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>26<sup>1</sup> The sons of kings are always free from paying custom or poll tax. The half-shekel was paid by God&#8217;s people for His temple. Since Christ was the Son of God, He was free from paying it. This was contrary to Peter&#8217;s answer concerning this matter.</p><p>Peter had received the revelation concerning Christ&#8217;s being the Son of God (16:16-17) and had seen the vision of the Son of God (v. 5). Now, in application of what he had seen, he was put to the test by the poll tax gatherers&#8217; question. He failed in his answer because he forgot the revelation that he had received and the vision that he had seen. He forgot that the Lord was the Son of God, who, as such, did not need to pay the poll tax for His Father&#8217;s house.</p><p>27<sup>1</sup> After shutting Peter&#8217;s mouth, the Lord, as the New Testament Prophet, today&#8217;s Elijah, told him to go fishing and that in so doing he would find a stater. This prophecy was fulfilled. Peter was no doubt troubled that he had to go fishing and wait for a fish to appear with a stater.</p><p>27<sup>2</sup> Equal to one shekel.</p><p>27<sup>3</sup> After convincing Peter that He did not need to pay the half-shekel, the Lord, as the New Testament Lawgiver, today&#8217;s Moses, commanded Peter to pay it for Him. The Lord did this purposely to teach Peter that in God&#8217;s New Testament economy He is the unique One; neither Moses nor Elijah nor Peter nor anyone else has the position to speak or to give the command.</p><p>27<sup>4</sup> While the Lord was correcting and teaching Peter, He took care of his need. This is always the Lord&#8217;s way in dealing with us.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>When Peter answered yes, the Lord said no. But when Peter was convinced that the Lord did not need to pay the tax, the Lord told him that He would pay it. Perhaps Peter was about to go after the poll tax gatherers and tell them that the Lord did not need to pay the tax. Peter might have been considering this when the Lord charged him to catch a fish with a stater in its mouth and to use that stater to pay the tax. The tax had to be paid in order not to stumble others. We cannot subdue the Lord Jesus. Whatever He says is always right, and whatever we propose to Him is always wrong. Christ is today&#8217;s Moses; He makes the laws. When He says yes, the answer is yes; and when He says no, it is no. What we say means nothing. It is what He says that counts. The meaning of the vision on the mountaintop is that we should hear the Lord Jesus and not anyone else, including ourselves. Christ, not Moses, is the One to say yes or no. Regarding the same matter, the Lord may say yes to someone else and no to you. If he does this, do not argue with Him.</p><p>The record here is very simple, but the story is rich in its implications....For us today, Christ is our Moses and Elijah....Whatever He says, that is the law, the law of life. Furthermore, what He says is today&#8217;s prophecy to meet our present, practical situation. This is not merely a story; it is a lesson for Peter and for us as well.
