<p>In order for God to be life to us, He cannot be outside of us; rather, He has to enter into man. In order for us to receive anything into us, there is the need for a receiving organ. For example, in order to receive food into our physical body, we need a stomach; to hear sound, we must have ears; and to see colors, we must have eyes. If we want to receive something, we must have an appropriate organ in order to receive it. Consequently, man needs a receiving organ in order to receive God. Therefore, God created man with a human spirit. Of all the living creatures, only man has a spirit, although angels, who are also created, are spirits (Heb. 1:14). When the Lord Jesus spoke of being the bread of life to eat and the living water to drink, He was not speaking of food that is received by our stomach, the food that perishes (John 6:27), but of Himself as spiritual food to be received in our human spirit (v. 63). In our spirit we can receive God as our spiritual bread and our spiritual water.</p>
<p>God created man with a spirit so that He could be received by man. Genesis 2:7 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; God used dust to form man&rsquo;s body and then breathed the breath of life into man&rsquo;s nostrils. This breath is not the same as God&rsquo;s Spirit. However, when this breath entered into man, it became man&rsquo;s spirit. In verse 7 the word <em>breath</em> is the same word in the original language as <em>spirit</em> in Proverbs 20:27. As a result of God&rsquo;s breathing, man became a living soul. Man has three parts: a physical body made from dust, a spirit formed by the breath that was breathed into him, and a soul that was produced when God&rsquo;s breath was breathed into him. The soul is deeper than the body, but it is not as deep as the human spirit.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:23 confirms that man has three parts, saying, &ldquo;May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete.&rdquo; This verse clearly states that man has three parts: spirit, soul, and body. Hebrews 4:12 proves that the spirit is distinct from the soul, because it speaks of the living word of God that is piercing &ldquo;even to the dividing of soul and spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Spirit Being for Contacting God</h2>
<p>God created a spirit for man so that man could receive Him, because He is Spirit. John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.&rdquo; Man&rsquo;s spirit is for man to contact God. If we consider this matter more deeply, we can add two more verses. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The fact that the Spirit can witness with our spirit proves that the purpose of our spirit is to receive God as Spirit and that God can come into our spirit because He is Spirit. Thus, the Holy Spirit can witness in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We can be joined to the Lord as one spirit because we have received Him as the Spirit in our spirit; thus, the Spirit and our spirit are one spirit. These two verses are quite deep, and we must consider whether we should present them to high school students or only to college students.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing Man&rsquo;s Spirit</h2>
<p>Besides the crucial points above, we must help the young saints to know their human spirit. Our conscience is a part of our human spirit, and the function of our conscience proves that we have a spirit. Despite the fact that a decision makes sense according to our intellect and reasoning, we still may have an uneasy sense in the depth of our being. This is because our reasoning capacity, which is related to our soul, is not as deep as the function of the conscience in our spirit. Although we may make a decision according to our intellect, there often is a sense in the depth of our being that causes us to have a sense of unease related to a decision that is based merely on our intellect. This sense is the response of our conscience. The most obvious example is stealing something from another person. Even though stealing may bring some sense of pleasure to our soul, there is an accusation, a condemnation, and even a fear in the depths of our being. These sensations come from the operation of our conscience in our spirit. In addition to our soul, there is a deeper part of our being that is our spirit, and this deeper part is manifested to us through the operation of our conscience in our spirit. Many times our intellect and emotions are in agreement to do a certain thing, but our conscience protests and condemns the inclination of our intellect and emotion. This proves that our spirit and our soul are different and that our spirit is deeper than our soul.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing Man as God&rsquo;s Vessel</h2>
<p>We can also speak to high school or college students about man being a vessel created by God. Romans 9:21-23 says, &ldquo;Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor? And what if God, wishing to demonstrate His wrath and make His power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, in order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory.&rdquo; This shows that God-created human beings are vessels. The purpose of a vessel is to contain something. God created man as a vessel to contain Himself.</p>
<p>Many people think that God created man as an instrument to be used by Him. This is not accurate. God created man as a vessel, and He wants to put Himself into this vessel so that He can be expressed. God does not want us to be an instrument. Second Corinthians 4:7 says, &ldquo;We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.&rdquo; When we were saved, God entered into us; thus, we have a treasure in us, the earthen vessels. Our main function in this universe, or we may say our only function, is to be God&rsquo;s vessel. Just as a light bulb is a vessel designed to contain and express electricity, we are vessels designed to contain and express God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Leading the Young People with the Word and the Spirit &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
