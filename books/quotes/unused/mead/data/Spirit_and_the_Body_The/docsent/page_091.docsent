   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE ONENESS OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we need to see something further concerning the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:4 says, "There is one body, and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although this word is short and simple, it includes the whole Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Body is one, and the Spirit also is one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Body and Spirit cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Body can be likened to our physical body, and the Spirit is like the life in our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If there were no life in our body, it would not be a body, but a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body, which is the church, cannot be separated from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where the Body is, there the Spirit must be also; and the Spirit must be one with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you have the Body, then you also have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if you do not have the Spirit, the Body is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body, the church, is not a matter of religion, teaching, theology, practice, serving God, or working for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, the Body is a matter of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the Spirit is one, the Body cannot be more than one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE SEVEN ONES</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Ephesians 4:4-6 Paul lists seven ones: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Apostle Paul listed the Body as the first item of the seven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I were to compose such a list, however, I would put these items in a good theological order.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would begin with the one God and then mention one Lord, one Spirit, one faith, one baptism, one Body, and one hope.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I read this chapter of Ephesians many years ago, I was troubled by the fact that Paul put the Body first and God last.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I wondered why Paul mentioned one hope before one Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To me, Paul's order was backwards.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, I have become accustomed to Paul's order.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As related to the Body, Paul spoke separately concerning the three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the one Spirit, he does not mention the one Lord, but the one hope.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then after the one Lord he does not speak of the one God, but of the one faith and the one baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this message we can cover only the matter of the one Body and the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul put the Body first because Paul's word here is altogether concerned with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The subject of this section is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Ephesians 4:3 says, "Endeavoring to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the bond of peace" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>. The word endeavor indicates that we should be desperate to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This oneness is not the oneness of doctrine or the oneness of theology; it is the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The oneness of the Spirit is just the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, to keep the oneness of the Spirit is to keep the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you are not in the Spirit, you are not in the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are in anything other than the Spirit, you are in a division.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit is the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, the oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are in the Spirit, you are in the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But if you are outside the Spirit, you are not in oneness, but in division.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may not realize how serious this is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be in a division, all that is necessary is to get out of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When you are out of the Spirit, you are no longer in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And as long as you are not in oneness, you are in division, for whatever is not oneness is division.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although there are many divisions, there is the unique oneness, and the unique oneness is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as you are not in the Body with the Spirit, you are in a division; and as long as you are outside the Spirit, you are outside the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever we think, say, and do in the Lord's recovery must be in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are not in the Spirit, you cannot say that you are in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Body is one with the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you are not in the Spirit, you are not in the oneness, but in division.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Everyone in the Lord's recovery needs a clear vision that the recovery is basically and fundamentally the recovery of the oneness of the Body.</S>
