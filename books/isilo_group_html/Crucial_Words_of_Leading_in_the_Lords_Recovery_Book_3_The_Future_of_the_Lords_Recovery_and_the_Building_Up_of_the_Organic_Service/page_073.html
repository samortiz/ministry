<p>Now we will consider the practical application of our fellowship. Who should the young full-time serving ones listen to in their service? Suppose that in a local church there are some co-workers and many young full-time serving ones. Who should the young ones listen to? This question is difficult to answer, because often both the elders and the co-workers have laid hands on them. This is also difficult because even though the full-timers were under the elders who laid hands on them, they may later be charged to appoint elders. God has no thought of organization. The elders laid hands on Timothy, but even when Timothy was young, Paul exhorted him to not let anyone despise his youth, and Paul also charged him to lay hands on the elders. Shortly after the elders laid hands on him, Timothy was qualified to lay hands on the elders. With just this one example, God completely demolished the concept of organization.</p>
<p>The elders laid hands on Timothy, but soon after that Timothy was charged to lay hands on the elders. This is anti-organization. Timothy was probably saved through the elders&rsquo; preaching of the gospel, and he was probably baptized by the elders. It was also the elders who commended Timothy to Paul and laid hands on him together with Paul. Thus, if the church and the work were based on the concept of organization, the elders would be his seniors, and he would be their junior. But the Lord has overthrown organization. The elders who laid hands on Timothy were not qualified to appoint elders; instead, Timothy, who received the elders&rsquo; laying on of hands, was qualified to appoint elders. When an elder sinned, Timothy even had the position and qualification to receive an accusation against the elder from two or three witnesses (5:19). Suppose the sinning elder was the one who preached the gospel to Timothy, led him to be saved, baptized him, commended him to Paul, and laid hands on him. The elder could say that he was above Timothy and that Timothy was beneath him. This is an organizational concept. It is organizational to consider oneself the patron of a serving one. God&rsquo;s ways are particular. He terminates all organizational concepts and practices.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is not organizational; it is organic. Timothy was not raised up by Paul. Rather, he was raised up by the church in Lystra and then recommended to Paul. This was an organic procedure. Paul did not receive Timothy according to organization. Paul, together with the elders, laid hands on Timothy. The laying on of hands was not organizational; it was organic. When Paul laid hands on others, it was according to the operation of the Holy Spirit. When he and the elders laid hands on others, it was an action of the Body. Therefore, there was a flow in the Body that flowed into this full-timer and became a gift within him. These matters were organic, not organizational. Many ordinations are organizational. People are given a position and a name without the organic operation of the Spirit, but the laying on of hands in the Body of Christ is an organic operation.</p>
<p>The laying on of hands by Paul and the elders was an action of the Body. In the Body the Holy Spirit operates in newly consecrated full-timers to constitute them as gifts. When this gift was manifested in Timothy, he appointed elders and laid hands on them according to his organic function. It was not because of his position that two or three witnesses could bring an accusation against an elder to Timothy; it was because of his organic function. Timothy received the laying on of hands from the elders according to the organic function of the Body; likewise, he appointed elders and laid hands on them according to the same organic function. It was in this same organic function in the Body that he could rebuke a sinning elder. All these matters are organic; they are not organizational.</p>
<p>This should be our practice today. The young full-timers that are raised up in the church in Taichung do not need to be approved by the brothers in Taipei. Rather, the brothers in Taichung, as members of the Body of Christ, can consider, through the operation of the Spirit, whether the saints are suitable to serve full time. This is an organic matter; it is not organizational. Whether or not this matter is organic depends on the way the elders handle it. If they stand merely in the position as elders, their action will be organizational. If they live and act as organic members of the Body by exercising their spirit to contact the saints and minister life to them, their action will be organic. Having been raised up in a church and also considered and confirmed by the elders in that church, the full-timers should be willing to submit themselves to the elders. However, when making arrangements concerning the full-timers, the elders should not stand merely in a position as elders and make arrangements; rather, they should exercise their organic function in the Body. Furthermore, the serving ones should listen to the elders but not merely because they are young. Otherwise, their submission will be organizational. Both the serving ones and the elders need to serve together in the church in life and under the anointing.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord's Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service &nbsp; pg 73</div><br></body></html>
