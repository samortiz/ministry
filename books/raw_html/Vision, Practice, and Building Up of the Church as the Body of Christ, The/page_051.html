 <h2 class="head2">Having Long-suffering by Being Restricted<br />
in Our Speaking</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:2 also speaks of long-suffering. According to my experience, long-suffering is related to our spoken word. In the church we must be careful concerning our speech and conversation. To keep from speaking something according to our particular desire is a real suffering. If we can bear this suffering, we can bear any suffering. A brother may wrong us, but for the Lord&rsquo;s glory and for the sake of the church life, we should not speak a word about it. This is the exercise of long-suffering mentioned in verse 2. If we have not learned this lesson, then whenever something happens to us, we will talk about it. If a brother wrongs us, we will tell our spouse immediately, and then we will use the telephone to tell the story to someone else. Since we are not able to bear our suffering, telling people about it puts us at ease. To utter, express, and talk about everything that happens to us requires no long-suffering or patience.</p>
<p>If we see the leading brothers quarreling, we may immediately go to relate this to another brother. To do this may make us feel very light and at ease, and the more we talk in this way, the more we enjoy it. However, if we have learned the lesson, for the Lord&rsquo;s glory and for the sake of His church we will not say a word. Instead, we will go to the Lord with tears. If our dear wife comes in and asks why we are weeping, we will simply say, &ldquo;It is nothing to concern you. Praise the Lord, Hallelujah!&rdquo; To say, &ldquo;It is nothing&rdquo; is not a lie, because in fact it is nothing to concern her. There is no need to say something to others. Rather, we should have long-suffering. If we learn to keep our words in such a proper way, we will realize the true meaning of the word <em>suffering</em> in the church life.</p>
<p>On the contrary, though, we often do not suffer because we prefer to speak. We like to talk about whatever we see and whatever happens. There is no burden or yoke to bear in this improper practice. Immediately after a message is given, we may begin to criticize the speaker, saying, &ldquo;That was a poor message. His language was broken, his accent was not right, his utterance was not very impressive, and I disagree with his emphasis.&rdquo; The more someone talks in this way, the more comfortable he may feel. Again, if we have learned the lesson, we will say nothing negative about the ministry, despite what we feel about it, for the sake of the practice of the church life. Our mouths will be under the control of the Holy Spirit. If when we return home, our children ask what the speaker said, we will be careful with our words. If we practice this, we will suffer in a proper way.</p>
<p>Our speech and conversation damage the church more than anything else. Some like to speak in person, and others like to write letters. It seems that there is no need to pay Western Union for a telegram. If something happens to the ministry here, within a few days many churches overseas will already know about it. We have many &ldquo;correspondents&rdquo; and &ldquo;mailmen&rdquo; who work without pay to deliver the news. If something happens on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, the next morning a &ldquo;church mailman&rdquo; will come to tell you about it. This is not a rebuke. Rather, it is my observation for more than thirty years. Word after word is passed on by telephone calls, letters, and personal contact. This builds up nothing but instead damages the church.</p>
<p>If we consider our past, we will realize how much we have been involved in this practice of passing on stories, unconsciously creating rumors. Once a story is second hand, it begins to change, and eventually it can become a great exaggeration. This is always the case with rumors. In order to learn the lesson of long-suffering, we need to experience the suffering of restricting our mouth and stopping our tongue. We may see and hear many things, but we should not speak a word without the anointing and leading of the Holy Spirit. We must not let the enemy use our tongue for his purpose. Regardless of what happens to us, even if a brother wrongs us, we should not say a word. If we have learned the lesson of long-suffering, we will not enjoy our improper speaking. Instead, we will suffer by saying nothing. This is the proper meaning of long-suffering in verse 2.</p>
<p>We have been practicing the church life in Los Angeles already for three years. If we consider the past, though, we will see how much damage comes from speaking too freely. Through our carelessness in speaking we have caused much trouble. We have caused others to suffer, and we ourselves also have suffered. Eventually, I made the decision to have long-suffering instead of another kind of suffering. Either way we will have suffering. If we do not suffer through long-suffering, we will suffer in a negative way by our speaking. It is better to choose long-suffering. Then we will be saved from the wrong kind of suffering, and the church life will be kept from damage. No one taught us this lesson in the way of Bible teaching, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we have learned this from our experience.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bearing One Another in Love<br />
to Avoid All Fear and Suspicion</h2>
<p>Verse 2 ends with &ldquo;bearing one another in love.&rdquo; In order to bear one another in love, we need to fight against suspicion and fear in the church life. Instead of these two things, we should have only love. To have suspicion towards a brother means that our love is gone. Then after suspicion, fear will follow. If two brothers are suspicious of each other, they will be like spies to one another. This will produce a mutual fear between them. In order to realize the practical church life, we all must rise up to fight the battle against suspicion. If there is no suspicion, there will be no fear of one another.</p>
<p>We must give no ground to suspicion and fear. We love our brothers; we do not fear them. First John 4:18 says, &ldquo;There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.&rdquo; We are not in a political circle, where even the leaders are suspicious of one another. We should never be suspicious of one another, and we should not try to spy on one another. If certain brothers say something about us, let them do it. We should not try to find out what they are saying. We should not go to a brother and say, &ldquo;Please tell me what they were talking about.&rdquo; If we do this, we are acting as politicians, not brothers. Rather, we should leave this matter to the sovereign hand of the Lord. We can tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, if it is Your will that I should know, and if it is for Your glory and the good of the church life, You will let me know through some channel.&rdquo; There is no need for us to ask what someone said. Because we have no suspicion of the brothers, we have no fear of them either. Therefore, there is no need to spy.</p>
<p>Sometimes when certain brothers have come to tell me something, I realize what they are doing, so I say, &ldquo;Brothers, please say no more. Do not go on.&rdquo; It is always a temptation to know others&rsquo; attitude toward us, how they consider us, and what they have said about us. In order to realize the church life, we must reject this temptation. We must have no suspicion. We believe in the Lord and consider that all the brothers are good. Therefore, there is no need to know too much. Regardless of how others consider us and talk about us, we are in the hand of the Lord. If we practice in this way, the door will be closed to the enemy.</p>
<p>If, on the contrary, someone is suspicious, this will cause a reaction, and this reaction will cause a chain reaction. Then in the church we will have not love but only suspicion and fear. We will have a church full of &ldquo;policemen.&rdquo; We will become not a police state but a &ldquo;police church.&rdquo; On many occasions we have suffered much because of this. A brother might report, &ldquo;I saw three brothers talking in their house until midnight,&rdquo; or he may inquire, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we see that brother in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting?&rdquo; This kind of speaking is the underground work of a spy. This damages the church. It does not build up; instead, it kills and tears down. If we truly intend to have the church life, we must learn the lesson to be careful in our speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit<br />
in the Uniting Bond of Peace</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:3 says, &ldquo;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.&rdquo; If we have peace only with God and not with all the brothers, we have lost the church life. The church life is tested by the peace we have, not only vertically with God but also horizontally with all the brothers. We need this kind of peace. We should not be over- related or under-related to anyone. The uniting bond of peace is the balanced relatedness in the church.</p>
