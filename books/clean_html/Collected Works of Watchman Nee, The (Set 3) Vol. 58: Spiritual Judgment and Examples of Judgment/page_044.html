Y.</h2><p>I was saved in a clear way through Brother Nee's preaching on Ephesians 2:8. In May of 1927 I was baptized. After this, my spiritual life took a big turn. I returned to my village to preach the gospel to my grandmother, mother, and brother. They all accepted and believed in the Lord. My father was in America, and he wanted me to go there. I did not want to go, and he was very unhappy. He became more unhappy when I told him that I wanted to serve the Lord full-time. Prior to that, he regularly sent me money. After he heard that I wanted to serve the Lord, he stopped sending me money. But I had faith. As the Bible says, when my parents reject me, God accepts me. Later I began to serve the Lord in the church in Hong Kong. It is the Lord's mercy that I am able to come to the mountain to receive this training. I also have consecrated myself to the Lord. I used to be very healthy; however, I suddenly have found that I have high blood pressure and other ailments. I began to be afraid. Later the Lord told me that my sickness was not unto death but for the glory of God. I dropped my anxiety and committed my sickness to the hand of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>When we have little light, we do not see anything. When we have a medium amount of light, we see clearly. But when we have great light, we become blurred again. When a man is in a very bright room, it is hard for him to see anything. Some lights provide guidance, while other lights subdue and make men blurred. If a man can describe what he has seen after a meeting, it proves that he has not seen anything. If a man can describe in detail how he fell like Paul, whether his head went down first or his feet went down first, he surely has not really fallen. He has only pretended to fall. As far as the knowledge of God is concerned, the more light we receive, the more we know Him. But as far as the breaking of our own self goes, the more light we have, the more unclear we become. A sober-minded person has never received any light. There is a preciousness to being blurred. After a man is enlightened by a great light, he becomes blurred and confused. The more he gropes in darkness and confusion and the more he places himself in the Lord's hand in the midst of weakness, the more he experiences grace. We are delivered by God through weakness. The Lord leads our way, and although the way is not always clear and we are not always certain of anything, we can look to Him moment by moment.</p><p>Paul asked the Lord three times in his weaknesses what he should do. The Lord only said, "My grace is sufficient for you." For Paul, this word was good enough. What this grace was, Paul did not know. Grace is a principle; it is not the fine points. When the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you," Paul did not have to ask about the fine points. All of God's revelation to us requires no thinking on our part. In the way of grace, we can only go on blurrily. When light comes, we do not have to be too concerned, analytical, or probing about it. We only need to stand calmly at a distance and look to the Lord. There is no need to be anxious. After Aaron's rod remained in the ark for a night, it sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit. The night signifies the period of darkness which comes before resurrection. In the dark night no one saw how the rod sprouted, blossomed, bore fruit, and grew. We do not know how that dead stick sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit. This is not of concern to us. Our responsibility lies in the fruit bearing; we do not have to be concerned about how the fruit is borne as long as it is genuine fruit. Our responsibility is to put the dead stick in the ark. What happens between the time that the dead stick is put in and when it becomes a fruitful stick is none of our concern. It does not matter to us anyway, because it is the Lord's business. As long as there is fruit, we are satisfied. What happens during the night is God's business. We can remain in our unclearness. After a while, we will see the fruit. During the night our responsibility is simply to wait on God.</p><p>Many people have forgotten that before the dead stick was vivified, the night was a dark, puzzling, and incomprehensible time. Everything related to the Lord becomes clear to us as soon as we are enlightened. But everything related to us remains altogether a mystery as to how it comes about. It is something veiled in darkness. This is the reason we have to set ourselves aside and put our situation totally in the Lord's hand. Anything that can die should die. Anything that cannot die will live. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p><p>The Lord did not put the stick in Aaron's room or in his hand for him to study, analyze, or investigate. The stick had to leave the owner's hand and be placed within the ark in the Holy of Holies; it went from Aaron's house to the sanctuary. It had to go through a long night. Aaron knew nothing about it. But the next day, everyone saw that the stick had sprouted, blossomed, and borne fruit. The same principle applies to our spiritual condition. We should only put ourselves in God's hand and remain there throughout the dark night. We should turn from the self and look to God's hand, until we see the blossom and the fruit. No one saw how the stick blossomed, but everyone saw the blooming flower. We should not worry and not try to understand anything. If we do, nothing will happen. It is a joke for a child to constantly think about whether or not he is growing up and about how much weight he puts on each day. We should never look at ourselves. If we are a failure, let it be. It is the way of the world to try to find out how one can avert his failures. This should not be a concern to us. We often do not know how we rise up after we have fallen. We have to learn to trust, not to know. All we need to do is believe; we do not need to know anything. We do not have to be smart, and we do not have to try to find out everything that God is doing. Those who are smart in their mind are usually void of light. Those who are enlightened and who look to the Lord all the time are never busy in their mind.</p><p>Many spiritual things only call for our faith, not for our knowledge. Paul was a wonderful person. After he heard the Lord's word, "My grace is sufficient for you," he became silent. "My grace is sufficient for you" only speaks of a principle; it gives no definite pattern and does not define any specifics. Paul was not concerned about what to do. His eyes were set on the principle; he did not push for the fine points. This is wonderful. Paul genuinely believed, and that was good enough. In pursuing the Lord's grace, we should not push for the fine points. We are apprehensive of messages that have no light, but we are equally apprehensive of messages that have so much light that everything becomes crystal clear immediately. If we are truly subdued by the light, we will not know anything; we will be satisfied with God's grace alone. May the Lord preserve us so that we can trust Him in the midst of our ignorance.</p>
