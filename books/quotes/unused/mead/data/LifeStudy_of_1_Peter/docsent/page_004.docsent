   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TWO THE OPERATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UPON THE ELECT FOR THEIR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PARTICIPATION IN HIS FULL SALVATION Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:1-2 A TRANSFORMED PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Peter 1:1 says, Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The name Peter denotes his regenerated and spiritual man, whereas Simon denotes his natural man by birth John 1:42; Matt 16:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, he was Simon, not Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The name Simon denotes the old man, the natural man, full of self.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when Peter came to the Lord Jesus, the Lord immediately gave him a new name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord looked at him and said, You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus never does anything merely in name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His changing of Simon s name had a reality behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By changing Simon s name the Lord Jesus indicated that He would change Simon into Peter, into a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we read the four Gospels and Peter s Epistles, we may find it difficult to believe that Simon, a Galilean fisherman, could be such a writer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the time he wrote his Epistles, Peter had been changed, transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One of the hymns in our hymnal begins with the words, Earthen vessel I was made, Christ in me the treasure laid Hymns, #548 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The last stanza of this hymn says, Transformation is my need.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Simon was an earthen vessel; Peter, however, was a transformed person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He had been regenerated and had become altogether new.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in his two Epistles we cannot see his flesh, the self, or his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, what we see is the new man expressed in his writing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is expressed in Peter s writing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1:1 Peter refers to himself as an apostle of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From Galatians 2:8 we know that Peter was an apostle to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CHOSEN PILGRIMS OF THE DISPERSION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first Epistle of Peter is addressed to the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These chosen ones were sojourning on the earth, somewhat like the children of Israel sojourning in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although they were chosen ones, they had been scattered and they were sojourning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word chosen brings in the thought of God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both of Peter s Epistles 2 Pet 3:1 are concerned with the government of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s government is universal; it deals with all His creatures in order that He may have a clean and pure universe 2 Pet 3:13 to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the New Testament age, this dealing begins from His chosen people, His elect, His own household 1 Pet 4:17 , especially from His chosen pilgrims who are dispersed and sojourning among the nations, the Gentiles, as His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, these two books emphasize the believers being chosen 2:9; 5:13; 2 Pet 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As God s chosen race, God s choice, God s particular possession, the dispersed chosen pilgrims need to see that they are under God s governmental dealing for a positive purpose, regardless of the situation and environment they are in. Anything and everything that happens to them, whether persecution or any other kind of trial and suffering 1 Pet 1:6; 5:9 , is just a part of God s precious governmental dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a vision will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them 5:10 that they may grow in grace 2 Pet 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word rendered pilgrims can also be translated sojourners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Strictly speaking, this term in this book refers to the Jewish believers who were sojourners, foreigners, dispersed in the Gentile world 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the principle of pilgrims can be applied to all believers, both Jewish and Gentile, because all are the heavenly pilgrims sojourning as foreigners on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These pilgrims are God s elect, chosen by God out of the human race, out of all the nations Rev 5:9-10 , according to His foreknowledge 1 Pet 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The term dispersion was familiar to all the scattered Jews among the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This word indicates that this Epistle was written to the Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is from the Greek word that means to scatter or spread abroad, with a root meaning to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This implies that the scattered Jews were sown as seeds among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 1 Peter speaks of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these were provinces in Asia Minor, between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.</S>
