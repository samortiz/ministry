   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING HANDING ONESELF OVER Taking Care of Others' Needs</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Shanghai I told some Communist members that Christians are saved in an inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We give up the world, but not because of outward coercion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not like the people in the world who become poor after their material goods are confiscated; we voluntarily free ourselves from the bondage of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Tomorrow night I hope you will prepare a list and bring the pocket money your parents have allotted to you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Find the minimum amount that you need to spend, then hand over the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I hope everyone will be faithful to do what they should.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are twenty-seven to twenty-eight assemblies in northern Kiangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the past eight months, none of the brothers and sisters there had the chance to even get a bowl of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more fortunate ones ate bean cakes, while the less fortunate ones ate grass and tree bark.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since I know the situation in all the places, I feel grieved and even angry when I see some brothers and sisters caring only for themselves and having no thought of saving.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Please forgive me for saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Hong Kong bean cakes are sold to Taiwan for fertilizer, but in northern Kiangsu only the most well off can afford to eat bean cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not know how you can eat your rice in peace when you hear this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This situation is happening not only in northern Kiangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In one or two months, more than half of the brothers and sisters in the church in Nanking will have nothing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I pray that God will free us from all kinds of considerations over so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I pray that we will only hand ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should let other brothers remember our own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul told the churches in Asia who had supplied the lack of other churches that these churches eventually would fill up their lack as well 2 Cor 8:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The brothers and sisters never imagined that they would face what they are facing today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same way, we never know what we will face tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope that we will remember them as brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I hope that we will hand ourselves over to fill up their lack.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before you handed yourselves over, I spoke with reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But now that you have handed yourselves over, I do not have any reservation; I am not afraid of suspicion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of you may have the thought of helping these ones, but think that you have too little.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please do not calculate what you can do, because you are not the only one who has handed yourself over.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When you hand yourself over, you are not doing it to please man, but to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Principle of Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today God is taking the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything should be done in the principle of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My heart rejoices to see that, under God's grace, we can coordinate together, not only in preaching the gospel but in offering up our money and time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not choose our field of study carelessly as we did before.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, we should choose subjects that are related to businesses that the saints have and concentrate on these professions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the coming days, these professions will afford us an unfettered occupation to support ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After three or five years, many brothers and sisters will be prepared to be sent to other places in China for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, we should gospelize the strategic places, and then we should move out to the surrounding towns and villages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How different is this kind of preaching from the individual preaching of one or two persons that we experienced in the past!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Presently, there are over five hundred assemblies in China.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have close to seventy thousand brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we pool our efforts together for the gospel enterprise, instead of working independently here and there, this will create a great impact!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the past our co-workers did not like to work in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now they have to learn the lesson of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They should take the lead in this matter, but this work does not belong to the co-workers alone; everyone has a part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not think that we only have to offer a little money or material goods.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This work is the responsibility of all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the Lord is gracious to us, I hope that many brothers will rise up, including older ones, and forsake everything to serve in coordination in the church.</S>
