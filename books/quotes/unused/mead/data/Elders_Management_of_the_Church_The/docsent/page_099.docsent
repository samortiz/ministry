   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Here you need to take out the files of the brothers and sisters and read them carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes you should not read them alone, but with the other responsible ones from the district.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Sometimes you have to fellowship with the brothers and sisters directly to touch their real inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After you have touched their real condition, you can classify them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The living ones will belong to one category.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The dead ones will belong to another category.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who are half-dead are also put into a third category.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During these days, I have been conducting this training.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes I have to stay up until midnight to prepare these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The next morning I have to rise up early again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Someone has told me that I am too tired.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I will tell the brothers and sisters that if I were to serve as an elder in Taipei, in another year, I would lose another thirty pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be an elder is much more exhausting than to take care of a training.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was taking care of the churches in northern China, we did this kind of classification at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We divided the brothers and sisters into twelve classes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The lowest-numbered class is the dead ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The highest-numbered class is the living ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In between are the half-dead ones, and the ones who have been dead for a long time and are about to come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After classification, we should not work with the dead ones or the living ones first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, we should work on the ones who are about to come alive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We looked up these people and fellowshipped with them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We invited them to the love feasts and helped them solve all their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we could not even help them ourselves, and we would ask another brother who had learned the lesson to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we did this for a while, some of these came alive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were class eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now they have advanced to level twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Next, we should work with the ones who are worse, the class-ten ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After a while, these also will become class twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By that time, there will be a sizable number of living ones in the church, and the church will almost become a wave offering; the meetings will become quite living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once classes ten and eleven have been enlivened, the church is about to move on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, in a family the father may be class eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mother may be class ten, and the daughter may be class nine.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once you have enlivened the class-eleven father and the class-ten mother, the daughter will more or less come along.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She would say, "Since my father and mother are loving the Lord, I should love the Lord too!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They may have another son in the house who belongs to class eight.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even he will become alive now.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this goes on, by the time the sixth class has been worked with, the church will no longer be a wave offering, but a heave offering as well, and there will be a real revival.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most people will have become living, and the remaining few, even if they are not living, will be made alive together.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I wish to tell the brothers and sisters that this was the revival of Chefoo in 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The brothers and sisters became alive one after the other, and there was no way for the church to fail to be revived.</S>
