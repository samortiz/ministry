After resurrection, spontaneously there is ascension. Every Christian must attain to this ascended life. The Lord Jesus was raised from among the dead and was seated at the right hand of God, "far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named" (Eph. 1:20-21). The ascended life is a life that triumphs over all of Satan's authority and power. Prior to the experience of ascension, we only have victory over the flesh, sins, and the world. When we are in ascension, we experience the warfare with, and victory over, every ruler, authority, power, lordship, dominion, and every name in the dark domain. We are able to attain to the ascended life when our spirit and soul are completely divided, when our spirit is absolutely free through resurrection, when we are no longer affected by the emotion and the mind of the soul, and when we are transcendent over all the environment and worldly affairs. Saints who have attained to the ascended life have a view that comes from the throne. They have the experience of not being affected by anything. Those who are truly crucified with the Lord will resurrect together with Him. And those who are truly resurrected with the Lord will ascend together with Him to the heavenlies. "If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God" (Col. 3:1-3).</P><P>The various lights are the sun, the moon, and the stars (Gen. 1:16). The sun is the light for the day. It is the source of heat and light for the earth. Its light is self-originating, unchanging, and constant. It is truly a type of the "heavenly Man." He was once on this earth, yet He has returned to glory. Malachi 4:2 declares this same thing. The glorious Lord Jesus is the "great light" of the heavens. When He was on the earth, He was "the rising sun...from on high" that visited us (Luke 1:78). He was also "the light of the world" (John 8:12). He was "the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man" (1:9). "And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it" (v. 5). "The light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil. For every one who practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be reproved" (John 3:19-20). Therefore, the Lord went back to the heavens to abide in the "tabernacle." When the millennial kingdom comes, He will be the "Sun of righteousness" and "the sun, /...like a bridegroom, goes forth from his canopy; / He rejoices like a mighty man running the course. / His rising is from the end of the heavens, / And his circuit is unto their ends; / And there is nothing hidden from his heat" (Psa. 19:4-6).</P><P>Today His light does not shine on this world. Only those who believe in Him are under His shining. "And the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me" (John 14:19). "But we see Jesus...crowned with glory and honor" (Heb. 2:9). "Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you" (Eph. 5:14).</P><P>In the morally dark night of today's world, people have lost sight of the sun. But the church has ascended on high and is still able to see the sun. Just as the moon reflects the sun at night, so the church, which abides in the light of Christ, becomes the light for the night which has rejected Christ. On the first day of our salvation, we received the light. "Believe into the light, so that you may become sons of light" (John 12:36). Now we reflect the light, and we are the witnesses of Christ in this perverse generation. "You are the light of the world....Let your light shine before men" (Matt. 5:14, 16).</P><P>In this ascended position the saints have a more intimate fellowship with the Lord Jesus. Is it not here that we see the true situation of the dark night? Is it not here that we sense the power of darkness close by? Is it not here that we have a broader view? Is it not here that we have a clearer view of Christ? What a position!</P><P>Although the brightness of the moon is second only to that of the sun, there is a tremendous difference between the two! Even though the moon is the light of the night, at her most beautiful and fullest moment, compared with the source of light, she cannot help but appear cold and silvery. Constantly she changes! She waxes and wanes! The degree of her waxing and waning depends on the degree of her movements in facing the sun! Sometimes she does not show forth any light at all. "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit" (2 Cor. 3:18). How easily she changes! According to God's ordination, she is a heavenly object remaining in the heavens. Yet according to man's view, she is not always there; and sometimes she disappears. Even when she is there, she is rarely in her fullness. It is not unusual for her to move away from the source of light. Her work is to receive. She has no glory of her own. All her glory comes from her Lord. In His light she is able to shine forth light. She does not have her own light. She does not need to worry or labor. When she faces the sun, it is her bright and shining day. When men look at her from the earth, she is "fair" (S.S. 6:10), she puts forth the choicest of the yield (Deut. 33:14), she "shall be established for ever...as a faithful witness in heaven" (Psa. 89:37), and there shall be an "abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth" (Psa. 72:7), yet life and the life supply are given to men by the direct rays of the sun itself. Our position in Christ is precious; yet directly experiencing His warmth is also important. When the sun rises, the stars and the moon are all seen no more.</P><P>The stars are a type of the individual saints today, because they "shine as luminaries in the world" (Phil. 2:15). When the sun goes down and the moon wanes, the stars come out. "And those who have insight will shine like the shining of the heavenly expanse, and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever" (Dan. 12:3).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 03, The Christian (1) &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
