   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GIVING CHRIST THE GROUND WITHIN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see the heavenly vision that in His economy, God wants nothing except Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the One who is God and man, He has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All that Christ is and all that He has obtained and attained have been compounded into the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How foolish not to give all the ground in our living to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we may love Him, we may still limit and restrict Him by our efforts to be good Christian husbands or wives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In ourselves, we still try to be humble, patient, kind, and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we do this, there is no way for Christ to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 14, the Lord Jesus spoke of His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Speaking of the disciples experience after His resurrection, He says in verse 19, Because I live, you shall live also.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was after His resurrection that the Lord could live in His disciples and they could live by Him, according to Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ wants to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When He lives in us, we live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But where are the Christians today who give Christ the free course to live in them?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Very few Christians do this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even we in the Lord s recovery do not give Christ the sufficient ground to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, we try to be humble and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We try to be a good husband or wife, a good brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the ground within us is occupied by ourselves and by our self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we may fail in our efforts, we repent, pray, ask for the Lord s cleansing, and then try once again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may even welcome the opportunity for a new beginning afforded by a new day, week, month, or year so that we may try once again to be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may comfort ourselves at the end of the day with the thought that in the morning we shall have a fresh opportunity to try again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may do the same thing at the end of a week, month, or year.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Especially at the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year, we may promise ourselves to have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may thoroughly clear the past, regret our shortcomings, repent for our mistakes, ask the Lord s forgiveness for our wrongdoings, and then try to have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may say, Let the past be the past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the new year I can have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, before long we find that our best efforts still result in failure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because we all have this tendency, I am burdened that we would see that God does not want us to try to be proper Christians He only wants us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should forget about trying to be a good husband or wife and care only to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us love Him, contact Him, and be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How near and available He is!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is within us and is one spirit with us, waiting to be given the opportunity to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would give Christ the ground to live in us, we should cease from all our efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead of asking the Lord to help us in our efforts, we should pray, Lord Jesus, I can do nothing apart from You.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How foolish I have been in trying so hard!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now, Lord, I see the vision that I cannot do anything without You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, I thank You that You dwell in me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I ask You, Lord, to work within me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, I praise You that You are my life and that You are waiting for the opportunity to live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Lord, I thank You that I am in You.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now I am willing to give You all the ground to do everything and to be everything in me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what it means for Christ to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After praying to the Lord in this way, we should turn to Satan and tell him to no longer tempt us to try to do anything apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Say to him, Satan, don t tempt me in this way anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I assure you that I cannot do anything apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Don t try to get me to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE NEED TO SEE THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the church meetings, we may enjoy singing, Christ liveth in me, Christ liveth in me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, when the meeting is over, we are the ones who live, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead of Christ living in us, our inward being is occupied with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if we see the vision of Christ living in us, we shall stop all our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How blessed it is to do nothing and to let Christ live in us!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord does not want us to try to improve our behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He does not want us to try to be a good husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Christian life is Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In such a life, we and Christ have one life and one living.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ lives in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Oh, we desperately need to see this vision!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to pray, Lord, show me the vision that God only wants one Person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He wants Christ to live in me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This vision will spontaneously terminate all of our efforts and doings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It will turn us from our trying to the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>CHRIST OUR UNIQUE STANDARD AND PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we cease from our own doing, we shall no longer have any standards or principles apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ will be our standards and our principles.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, instead of having a standard that determines what is a good husband or wife, we shall have Christ as our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Likewise, instead of having standards concerning kindness, humility, and love, our only standard will be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When Christ becomes our unique standard and principle, He will have the free course to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then we shall enjoy Him and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>LETTING CHRIST LIVE IN US</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The book of Colossians reveals that God wants Christ and Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this Epistle, Paul points out that God does not want anything of man s culture.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God does not care for philosophy, religion, ordinances, observances, or any kind of ism.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God wants only the wonderful, preeminent, all-inclusive Christ, the One who is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although Christ is all-inclusive, He dwells in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As the indwelling One, He is waiting for the opportunity to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is living, real, practical, and available.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>On the one hand, on the throne He is the Lord of all; on the other hand, He is the life-giving Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Both in the Christian life and in the church life, Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we see this, we shall stop all our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the church life, God does not want us to be doing so much; He simply wants Christ to live in us and grow in us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If I have a vision of Galatians 2:20 that it is no longer I, but Christ who lives in me I shall never assume that I can do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I shall spontaneously cease from all my trying, for I shall realize that I am nothing and nobody and that Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As the One who dwells in us to be our life, He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He is our holiness, our power, and our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But He needs to be given the opportunity to be everything in us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we give Him the ground, He will come in to be everything and to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is what it means to let Christ live in us.</S>
