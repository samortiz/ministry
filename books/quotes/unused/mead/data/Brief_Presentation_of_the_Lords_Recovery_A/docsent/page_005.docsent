   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Son and the Father Being One,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Spirit Being One</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>with both the Father and the Son</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Son came with the Father to accomplish redemption John 6:46 , and the Father was with the Son all the time while the Son was on the earth John 8:16b, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 6:46 the preposition translated from carries the sense of from with.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, when the Lord Jesus came to the earth to accomplish redemption, He came not only from the Father but also with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 8:16 and 29 the Lord Jesus told us that He was not alone, but the Father was always with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Son also came in the name of the Father John 5:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why in Isaiah 9:6 the Son is called the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, the Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name John 14:26a .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These two things are evidence not only that the Son and the Father are one, but also that the Spirit is one with both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Three of the divine Trinity are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>a. For the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>into the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of economy, arrangement, or plan, is for the dispensing of the divine Trinity into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Romans 8:5-11 we can see this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the Believers to Experience and Enjoy</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>the Processed Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This arrangement is also for the believers to experience and enjoy the processed Triune God 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That the Processed Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>and the Regenerated Believers May Be Mingled as One</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>for the Building Up of the Organic Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This arrangement is also that the processed Triune God and the regenerated believers may be mingled as one Eph 4:4-6 for the building up of the organic Body of Christ Eph 4:12-13, 15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Ephesians 4:4-6 tells us that there is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the Triune God is mingled with the Body of Christ, that is, with us, the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This mingling is for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ephesians 4:12-13 and 15-16 are four verses that show us that the mingling of the divine Trinity with the believers is for an organic building, the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the aforementioned items have been altogether missed by most Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the training received by most students of theology, they are merely told in a general way that God is triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most Christians have not gone beyond this point in their understanding of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, all the points mentioned above are clearly revealed in the divine revelation, especially in the New Testament.</S>
