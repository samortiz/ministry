   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The secret, the key, is the calling, because calling on the name of the Lord is the breathing Lam 3:55-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all need to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever you read any verse, any chapter, or any portion of the Bible, you have to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the time mingle your reading with your calling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mere reading does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You have to turn your reading into praying by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The proper pray-reading with the calling on the name of the Lord really nourishes us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we breathe in the Lord, we also receive Him as our food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The food is one with the water, and the water is one with the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Within the breath is the water, and within the water is the food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is revealed clearly throughout the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The tree of life as food grows in the water of life Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This proves the food is in the water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Also, the water is in the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>So when we breathe in the breath, we get the water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, with the breathing, there is the drinking, and with the drinking, there is the eating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The eating and the drinking are included in the breathing, and the breathing is our calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Corinthians also shows us the eating, the drinking, and the calling.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chapter ten says that we eat the same spiritual food and drink the same spiritual drink vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then chapter twelve shows that we all have been made to drink of one Spirit v. 13 by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one can say, "Lord Jesus," but in the Holy Spirit v. 3 . In other words, whenever you say, "Lord Jesus," you are drinking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you merely read the Word without calling on His name, you cannot get the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if you call on the Lord, you experience the refreshing, the watering, and the nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, if you merely call on the name of the Lord, you still miss something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You need the Word to match your calling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the way to breathe, drink, and eat, to take Christ in as our air, water, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we enjoy Him as our abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot stay away from the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have the Spirit within and the Word without.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we have these two greatest gifts as our wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can receive these gifts by mingling our reading with praying and our calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever you read the Bible, you have to pray and call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is by this calling that you breathe, by this breathing that you drink, and by this drinking that you eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to mingle these three things together: calling, praying, and reading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to make these three things one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I would advise you that whenever you touch the word of the Bible, right away you have to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You should have the strong sensation that if you merely read the Word without calling on the name of the Lord, that is a big loss.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever you open up the Word and read it, right away you have to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is by this that you breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you breathe, you drink, and when you drink, you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Word gets into you as life and as life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the Word will be one with the Spirit within you to refresh you, to water you, to nourish you, and to give you the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is by this that we take the Lord in again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Make calling, praying, and reading three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then it will be hard to discern whether you are reading, praying, or calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While you are calling, you are praying; while you are praying, you are reading; while you are reading, you are praying; while you are praying, you are calling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the word of the Bible becomes spirit and life to you John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is by this way that we take the Lord into us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is absolutely different from today's Christian religion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even in the book of Revelation, there is the same concept of taking in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life" 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then He says, "Let him who wills take the water of life freely" 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To eat of the tree of life and to drink of the water of life are the main aspects in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This book at the conclusion of the whole Bible shows that out of the redeeming God flows the river of water of life, and in the river of water of life grows the tree of life 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The river of water of life is flowing, and the tree of life is growing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the end of the whole Bible, the last call from God is a call to take the water of life freely 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Spirit and the bride yearn that the thirsty ones would come to take the water of life for their satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you drink the water, you get the food.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is God's final call, and this will produce the new city, the holy city, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All that we need is to come and drink the water of life that we may feed on Christ as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This will produce the Body of Christ, the church life, the local churches, and ultimately the holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now we have seen the secret of how to take in Christ, that is, to breathe Him, to drink Him, and to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The way is by calling upon Him and praying and reading, by mingling these three things together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the way to contact the Spirit and touch the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this way we can participate in Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ today is the air, the water, and the food.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After He gets into us, He will do a lot of things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must be willing to put aside our old concept and learn to call upon the name of the Lord, to pray by reading, and to read by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must learn to mingle calling, reading, and praying into one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then we will enjoy Christ and take Christ into us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This will accomplish many things within us to fulfill God's eternal purpose.</S>
