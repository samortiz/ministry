<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Hence, the Neighboring Local Churches<br>Being Clustered as Much as Possible<br>in the Blending Way</H2><P>Hence, the neighboring local churches should be clustered as much as possible in the blending way for the spiritual benefits in the mutual building up of the Body of Christ, as the Lord Jesus clustered the seven neighboring churches in Asia.</P><P>There is only one Body in this universe. This one Body is the one church of God manifested in many localities as many local churches. Although the local churches are many in existence, they are still one universally in element, and they all express that one element.</P><P>The base of the one Body is, first, the Triune God. There is only one God, who is triune. The Triune God is for the Body. The Father is the source of the Body, the Son is the element of the Body, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body (Eph. 4:4-6). This Triune God cannot be divided; therefore, neither can the one Body be divided.</P><P>Second, there is only one incarnation, and there is only one Christ in His incarnation. Third, there is only one crucifixion, and fourth, there is only one resurrection. Finally, there is only one Christ in His ascension. Today all these elements as the base of the one Body are in the one Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 shows us that we were all baptized in one Spirit into the one Body and were all given to drink the one Spirit.</P><P>If we truly see this, we will not only have the one accord in our own locality, but we will also keep the oneness of the Body, which is the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3). Before the day of Pentecost one hundred twenty saints could pray together for ten days steadfastly in one accord because they saw the base of the one Body. They saw with their own eyes the Triune God in His incarnation. They also saw Christ's crucifixion, Christ's resurrection, and Christ in His ascension. This is the reason that they could be in one accord. This one accord brought in the outpouring of the Spirit, which resulted in three thousand being saved on the day of Pentecost. What an increase and what a blessing came in through the one accord!</P><P>The secret of the practice of the church life is not only the one accord in the local churches but also the oneness in the universal Body. Today some insist on saying that every local church has its own jurisdiction and administration and that no one else should touch any of its affairs. To say such a thing is to make all the local churches separate from one another. This is separation; this is not oneness.</P>
