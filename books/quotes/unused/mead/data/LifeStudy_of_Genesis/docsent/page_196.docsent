   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Three Stories</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The ark was of three stories, the lower, the second, and the third 6:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first, second, and third stories signify the height of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The three sections of the tabernacle signify the depths into which we all must enter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The three stories of the ark signify the height which we all must attain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In one sense we are getting deeper, and in another sense we are getting higher.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Undoubtedly, the three stories of the ark signify the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Trinity of the Godhead, we always say, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Which Person of the Trinity is the first story?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is easy to say who is the second, for we all know that the Son is in the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But is God the Father or God the Spirit the first story?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Luke 15 we find three parables: the shepherd recovering the lost sheep, the woman seeking and finding the lost coin, and the father receiving the returned prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first parable concerns the Son, the second concerns the Spirit, and the third concerns the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to our experience, the Spirit firstly came to us, found us, brought us to the Son, and inspired us to believe in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After we believed in the Son, we called, "O Father."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit brings us to the Son, and the Son brings us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we come to the Father, we are in the third story.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospel of John is a book of the Son, and the First Epistle of John is a book of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the book of the Son, we have grace, but in the book of the Father, we have love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Love is higher than grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Gospel of John we have the truth, but in the First Epistle of John we have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Light is higher than truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Gospel of John is good, for it brings us to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The First Epistle of John, however, brings us to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all must go on from the Son to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first story of the ark is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians like to talk about the so-called baptism in the Holy Spirit and about the charismatic things, but this is all in the first story.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all must go to the Spirit in order to know the Son, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To know Christ is different; it is higher.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Someday we shall all reach the story of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the highest, greatest, and most mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose I have a residence of three stories.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are not my special friend, I would only admit you into the first story.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would not allow you into the second.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you are my good friend, I would admit you into the second story.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, unless you are so intimately related to me, I would never bring you into the third story to show you some of my mysteries, secrets, and hidden treasures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would not dare to reveal to you my secrets and my riches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Who would be allowed into the third story?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Certainly my wife would be there.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The outsiders could never get into the third story.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose that you are now in the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Would you prefer to stay in the first, second, or third story?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have no doubt that Noah, his sons, and daughters-in-law were in the third story.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The lower beasts and creeping things might have been in the first story and the higher animals in the second.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I can testify to you that I have passed the first story.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I want to go higher and higher.</S>
