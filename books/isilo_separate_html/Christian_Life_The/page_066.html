We have seen in the previous message that the life-giving Spirit is a compound, as typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. The life-giving Spirit has been compounded with God as the base, typified by the one hin of olive oil, and with man, typified by the four spices. This all-inclusive Spirit is also compounded with all the elements of the process through which God has passed. In this compound there is the death of Christ, signified by myrrh, and the resurrection of Christ, signified by calamus. There is also the effectiveness of the death of Christ, signified by cinnamon, and the repelling power of the resurrection of Christ, signified by cassia.</P><P>The one hin of oil and the three units of five hundred shekels among the spices signify the unique Triune God. The second unit is split into two, signifying that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split on the cross. In the compound Spirit we have God, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the uplifted Man. In the compound Spirit, we also have Christ's death, the effectiveness of Christ's death, Christ's resurrection, and the repelling power of Christ's resurrection. The compound Spirit is the totality of all of these items. God, God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, the uplifted Man, the death of Christ, the effectiveness of His death, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of His resurrection are compounded together, blended together, to be the compound life-giving Spirit.</P><P>Today where is God? We have to say, "In the Spirit." Where is the Father? "In the Spirit." Where is the Son? "In the Spirit." Where is the Spirit? "In the Spirit." Where is the uplifted Man? "In the Spirit." Where is the death of Christ? "In the Spirit." Where is the effectiveness of the death of Christ? "In the Spirit." Where is the resurrection of Christ? "In the Spirit." Where is the power of the resurrection of Christ? "In the Spirit." Thus, if we have the Spirit, we have everything.</P><P>When we have some sensation that God is with us, we are sensing the Spirit. When the husbands are about to argue with their wives, they may experience something within urging them to stop. At that juncture, they are sensing that the Spirit is there with the death of Christ. Without the Spirit, we cannot experience the death of Christ, because His death is in the Spirit.</P><P>We need to realize that without the Spirit, we cannot experience anything of God in His economy. No Spirit, no God the Father. No Spirit, no God the Son. No Spirit, no God the Spirit. No Spirit, no uplifted, glorified Man. No Spirit, no death of Christ. No Spirit, no effectiveness of the death of Christ. Without the Spirit, the death of Christ is far away from us in time and space. But with the Spirit, Christ's death is here to kill us, to crucify our old man. No Spirit, no resurrection. No Spirit, no salvation. No Spirit, no regeneration. No Spirit, no renewing. No Spirit, no sanctification. No Spirit, no transformation. No Spirit, no conformation. No Spirit, no glorification. Every positive thing in this universe in the economy of God is compounded in this Spirit. Today we can see, by God's enlightenment, the all-inclusiveness of the Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> </body></html>
