<h2 class="head2">Teaching Heretical Doctrines and<br />
Going against the Teaching of the Apostles</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy the desolation of the church reached an extreme level. Some people taught heresy and blatantly opposed the teaching of the apostles. Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to the apostle Paul (4:14). Hymenaeus and Philetus said that the resurrection had already taken place and overthrew the faith of some (2:17-18), and their words spread like gangrene. All in Asia seemed to forsake the apostle&rsquo;s teachings and turned away from him (1:15). Even Paul&rsquo;s former co-worker Demas abandoned Paul, because he loved the present age (4:10). When Paul stood trial in Rome, no one stood with him (vv. 16-17). This was the situation in approximately A.D. 67, only about thirty years after the producing of the church in Jerusalem. Although Paul had been an apostle for a little more than twenty years, the church was corrupted to such an extent.</p>
<p>In 2 Peter the church was in desolation because of the preaching of heretical doctrines (2:1). False teachers made heresies into doctrines and preached them to others. In speaking of heresies, 2:1 mentions the problem of the false teachers, and verse 15 mentions the problem of Balaam. Peter&rsquo;s description shows that the church was full of heretical teachings. Jude 4-19 also speaks of the desolation. Jude says in verse 24 that God is able to guard us in the midst of the desolation, but the desolation he describes is the same as that in 2 Peter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Confessing That Christ Came in the Flesh</h2>
<p>First John 2:18-19 says that some went out from among the apostles, leaving the fellowship of the apostles. This proves that the church was degraded at that time. Second John 9-11 says even more clearly that the believers must not receive certain so-called church workers. The believers were not only to refrain from receiving these workers, they were not even supposed to greet them, because they went beyond the teachings of Christ. Although they worked in the church, they were antichrists; they went beyond the teachings of Christ and taught in opposition to Christ&rsquo;s redemption and salvation. They did not confess that Jesus Christ was God manifested in the flesh. Their biggest problem was denying the Person of Christ by not confessing that the Lord came in the flesh (1 John 4:3). This is similar to modernists who say that the Lord Jesus was a man but do not confess that He is God. The apostle John calls this kind of person an antichrist (2 John 7). An antichrist&rsquo;s teachings are unrelated to Christ and even oppose Christ. This shows that the desolation of the church was very serious at that time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Idolatry and Fornication</h2>
<p>The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 were dictated by the Lord to the apostle John. Each of the seven epistles speaks of the desolation of the church. Although the second epistle, addressed to the church in Smyrna, and the sixth epistle, addressed to the church in Philadelphia, do not mention the desolation of the church in these particular localities, they still indicate that the church was in desolation. The other epistles, especially the one to the church in Thyatira, show that the church was degraded to the uttermost. The church in Thyatira committed the two greatest sins, idolatry and fornication. Man&rsquo;s greatest sin before God is idolatry, and the greatest sin among men is fornication. These two gross sins both existed in the degraded church.</p>
<p>In the last epistle to the church in Laodicea, the Lord is no longer within the church. Rather, He is standing outside the door. The Lord is standing outside the door of the church in Laodicea.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESOLATE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH TODAY</h2>
<p>A basic principle is that every word in the Bible regarding the desolation of the church requires all two thousand years of church history for its exposition. Anything in the Bible concerning the desolation of the church, even a brief reference, needs all of church history for its explanation. For example, <em>divisions</em> is a very simple word in 1 Corinthians 1:10, but this simple word can be fully described only through all the events of church history. Idolatry is another great matter in church history.</p>
<p>In 1940 in Shanghai, the brothers took me to a Russian Orthodox church. It was very similar to a Roman Catholic church. Inside the doorway there was a table where candles were sold, just as in an idol temple. Worshippers first bought a candle, which they lit before entering further. There were many icons of Peter and Paul in the chapel. The people would find an icon and bow before it, then place their candle in front of it and kneel. This was identical to the practice of Chinese idol worshippers in the idol temples. When we asked them who they were worshipping, they said they were worshipping the fathers, but before them would be a picture of Peter. We could not take this; there was no difference between this and the Chinese idol temples. Later, we went to the &ldquo;Black Nazarene&rdquo; church in Manila and saw the worshippers there. It is difficult to describe such superstition. The statue of Peter in Saint Peter&rsquo;s Basilica in Rome has been kissed so much by worshippers that one of its feet has been worn away. These examples show the extent of the idolatry in the degraded church.</p>
<p>After Constantine, the church was corrupted by idolatry. The bones of the so-called saints were sold to superstitious people; this was a lucrative business. People worshipped the bones because of their superstition. More and more bones were sold, and many were fakes. The problem of money is also present in the desolation of the church. Some people make preaching the word into a profession or make godliness a means of gain (1 Tim. 6:5). In addition, in the history of the church there are many cases of heresy. If we consider the portions concerning the desolation of the church from 2 Corinthians, Philippians, 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and the epistles in Revelation, we will see that the matters that the Bible records as part of the desolation of the early church are still present in the church today.</p>
<p>The worst titles that the Lord gives to the church are &ldquo;great harlot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Babylon the Great&rdquo; (Rev. 17:1-5). <em>Babylon</em> in Greek is equivalent to <em>Babel</em> in the Old Testament. Both words refer to confusion and fornication. Today the so-called churches in Christianity are Babylon. The final titles for the church in the Bible are also feminine: &ldquo;bride&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Jerusalem&rdquo; (21:2). The New Jerusalem is pure, not confused and not mixed.</p>
<p>As children of God, we can easily discern between Babylon and the New Jerusalem in our speaking; however, it is difficult to make this distinction in the age in which we live. Some things belong to Babylon, but we think they are of the New Jerusalem; some things are mixed, but we think they are pure; some things have changed in nature, but we think they are as they were in the beginning. In the church today many people think that the improper, desolate situation of the church is its normal condition.</p>
<p>In speaking of the course of the church, we need to realize that every item of the desolation mentioned in the Bible has been fulfilled in the history of the church. May God have mercy on us that our eyes would be opened to see what things in the church are of Babylon and what things are of the New Jerusalem, to see what things should be in the church and what things should not. We must have the ability to discern these matters.</p>
