<h1 class="title">The Incarnation of Christ, the Man-Savior,<br />
Fulfilling God&rsquo;s Purpose in His Creation of Man</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26-27; Luke 1:35;<br />
John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim. 3:16</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In order to know Christ, the God-man, as the Man-Savior, we need to know the intrinsic significance of Christ&rsquo;s incarnation&mdash;Luke 1:35:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His incarnation Christ brought the infinite God into the finite man&mdash;Micah 5:2; John 8:58; Luke 2:40, 52.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation Christ was the complete God manifested in the flesh&mdash;1 Tim. 3:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He was manifested in the flesh not only as the Son but also as the complete God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;Matt. 1:20; Luke 1:35; John 8:29.</li>
		<li>The entire God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;participated in the incarnation of Christ&mdash;1:14; Luke 1:35; Gal. 4:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The incarnation of Christ was the union, mingling, and incorporation of the Triune God with the tripartite man&mdash;Luke 1:35; John 1:1, 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Union</em> concerns oneness in life; <em>mingling</em> is related to the divine and human natures; and <em>incorporation</em> denotes persons coinhering in each other.</li>
		<li>Through His incarnation Christ brought God into man and made God one with man&mdash;v. 14.</li>
		<li>The incarnation of Christ was the mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;Luke 1:35, 42-43:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The weaving together of the gold and the linen threads in the ephod signifies the mingling of divinity and humanity in Christ, the God-man (the two natures remaining distinct in the mingling)&mdash;Exo. 28:6.</li>
			<li>Through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation the gold and the linen, divinity and humanity, were woven together, mingled&mdash;John 1:1, 14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As the God-man, the Man-Savior was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence and was born of a human virgin with the human essence&mdash;Matt. 1:20; Luke 1:31, 35; Gal. 4:4:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The conception of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, producing the God-man, the One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced&mdash;Luke 1:35; 2:40, 52.</li>
			<li>This is the most wonderful and excellent person of Christ in His incarnation&mdash;Isa. 9:6.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ in His incarnation was the incorporation of the Triune God with the tripartite man&mdash;John 14:10-11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation; the three of the Divine Trinity are incorporated into one incorporation by coinhering mutually and by working together as one&mdash;vv. 10-11.</li>
			<li>In His incarnation the second of the Divine Trinity brought this incorporation into humanity&mdash;1:14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>As the union, mingling, and incorporation of the Triune God with the tripartite man, the Lord Jesus is the Triune God-man&mdash;v. 14; Col. 2:9; 1 Tim. 3:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is not only the God-man but also the Father-the Son-the Spirit-man&mdash;Matt. 1:20; Luke 1:35; John 8:29.</li>
			<li>The Savior in whom we believe and whom we have received is the wonderful Triune God-man&mdash;Luke 2:11; Acts 5:31; Phil. 3:20.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The incarnation of Christ, the Man-Savior, fulfilled God&rsquo;s purpose in His creation of man&mdash;Eph. 1:9; 3:11; Gen. 1:26-27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It is a great thing to see that the incarnation of Christ is closely related to the purpose of God in creating man&mdash;Rev. 4:11; John 1:14; Luke 1:35.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in His creation of man in His image and according to His likeness was that man would receive and contain Him as life and express Him in His attributes&mdash;Gen. 1:26-27.</li>
	<li>Man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness in order to be God&rsquo;s duplication for God&rsquo;s expression:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Genesis 1:26-27 <em>image</em> refers to the inward being, and <em>likeness,</em> to the outward expression&mdash;2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3; Phil. 2:7.</li>
		<li>The image of God is related to His duplication; God created man in His own image with the intention that man would become His duplication&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10.</li>
		<li><em>Image</em> implies that man has the capacity to take God in and contain Him; God created man in His image to be His container&mdash;Gen. 2:7; 2 Cor. 4:7.</li>
		<li><em>Likeness</em> refers to outward form, outward fashion, outward appearance; hence, <em>likeness</em> is a matter of expression&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Phil. 2:7:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Man was made in God&rsquo;s image to be a duplicate of God and according to God&rsquo;s likeness to have the appearance of God for His expression.</li>
			<li>The image is the inward reality of the outward expression, and the likeness is the expression, or the outward appearance, of the image.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The image of God is related to the divine attributes, especially love, light, righteousness, and holiness&mdash;1 John 4:8, 16; 1:5; Rom. 3:21-22; Heb. 12:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>For God to create man in His image means that He created man with the capacity to have His love, light, righteousness, and holiness.</li>
			<li>The human virtues created by God are the capacity to contain God&rsquo;s attributes&mdash;Luke 1:75.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In order for God&rsquo;s purpose to be carried out, it is necessary for man to receive God and contain Him as the tree of life&mdash;Gen. 2:7, 9; John 3:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Since the first man, Adam, failed God in His purpose, God Himself came in the Son through incarnation to be the second man in order to fulfill His purpose that man would contain Him and express Him&mdash;1 Cor. 15:47.</li>
	<li>The Gospel of Luke is a revelation of the God-man who lived a human life filled with the divine life as its content, thereby expressing God in humanity&mdash;7:11-17, 36-50; 10:25-37; 19:1-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The divine nature with its attributes was expressed in the Man-Savior&rsquo;s human nature with its human virtues; thus, the living of the Lord Jesus was humanly divine and divinely human&mdash;1:26-35; 2:7-16, 34-35, 40, 52.</li>
		<li>We need to know the Lord as the One who lived a life in which the human virtues expressed the divine attributes.</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Lord, we see Thy glory, / Shown in human beauty, / Full of splendor, manifested / In humanity&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #62).</li>

<h1 class="title">The Highest Standard of Morality</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 1:31-32, 35, 68-69, 75, 78-79; 2:40, 52</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We need to understand clearly what is meant by <em>the highest standard of morality</em>:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The highest standard of morality is the standard of life required by God&mdash;a life in which the divine attributes are expressed in the human virtues&mdash;Matt. 5:48.</li>
	<li>The highest standard of morality is the living of the One&mdash;the Lord Jesus Christ as the Man-Savior&mdash;whose life was a composition of God with the divine attributes and man with the human virtues&mdash;Luke 1:35.</li>
	<li>A living where the human life is filled with the divine life and the human virtues are strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes is what we call the highest standard of morality&mdash;6:35; 7:36-50:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is expressed in the living that is according to the highest standard of morality&mdash;5:12-16.</li>
		<li>If we understand this matter, we will understand the basic and crucial principle followed by Luke in writing his Gospel&mdash;8:39.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Gospel of Luke we see the kind of man that God intended to have in Genesis 1 and 2&mdash;Luke 8:39; Gen. 1:26-27; 2:7, 9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention was to have a God-man&mdash;Luke 1:68-69, 78-79:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The man in Genesis 1 was merely a God-created man, not yet a God-man&mdash;vv. 26-27.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s intention was that the man created by Him would receive Him, as signified by the tree of life, and thereby become a God-man&mdash;2:7, 9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>One day God Himself became a man named Jesus, conceived of the divine essence and born of the human essence&mdash;Matt. 1:20-21; Luke 1:31-32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus, the God-man, is a composition of the divine essence with all the divine attributes and the human essence with all the human virtues&mdash;vv. 35, 75; 2:40, 52.</li>
		<li>When He was on earth, the Man-Savior lived a life that was the mingling of the divine attributes and the human virtues; this is the highest standard of morality&mdash;vv. 40, 52.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The subject of the Gospel of Luke is the Man-Savior and His salvation in the highest standard of morality&mdash;1:31-32, 35, 68-69, 78-79:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Gospel of Luke reveals that in the Man-Savior we have the mingling of the divine attributes with the human virtues to produce the highest standard of morality&mdash;v. 35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Man-Savior and His salvation are both in the highest standard of morality&mdash;2:52; 7:11-17.</li>
		<li>According to the Gospel of Luke, our Savior lives, behaves, and works in the highest standard of morality, and His salvation is carried out in the highest standard of morality&mdash;10:25-37.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The record in the Gospel of Luke has a particular characteristic&mdash;to reveal in the Man-Savior the mingling of the divine attributes with the human virtues to produce the highest standard of morality for the New Testament jubilee&mdash;1:31-32, 35, 42, 68-69, 75, 78-79; 4:16-19.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Gospel of Luke portrays the Lord Jesus as a God-man, the Man-Savior, with the highest standard of morality&mdash;9:51-56; 13:10-17; 19:1-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Gospel of Luke three categories of things reveal that the Lord Jesus, the Man-Savior, lived in the highest standard of morality, with the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Gospel messages&mdash;4:16-21; 7:41-43; 12:14-21; 13:2-5.</li>
		<li>Gospel parables&mdash;10:30-37; 14:16-24; 15:3-32; 18:9-14.</li>
		<li>Gospel cases&mdash;7:36-50; 13:10-17; 16:19-31; 19:1-10; 23:39-43.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When the Lord Jesus went into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil, He was the highest kind of man&mdash;a God-man in the highest standard of morality&mdash;4:1-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus stood as such a man before the devil&mdash;vv. 2-4.</li>
		<li>In the Gospel of Luke the temptation to worship the devil in exchange for the kingdoms of the earth is given in detail; this also indicates the highest standard of morality&mdash;vv. 5-8.</li>
		<li>The Man-Savior, the One who lived in the highest standard of morality, could not be seduced or moved by anything&mdash;vv. 9-13.</li>
		<li>Only a life in the highest standard of morality&mdash;that is, a life in which the divine attributes are expressed in the human virtues&mdash;can withstand such a temptation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 22:47&mdash;23:25 the Lord Jesus is portrayed as the true God and a real man:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The God-man was arrested, mocked, blasphemed, despised, and judged, but as He passed through all this, He is fully portrayed as having the highest standard of morality, as possessing the human virtues with the divine attributes and with the all-surpassing divine splendor.</li>
		<li>As the true God and a real and proper man, He was fully qualified to be the Substitute for the sinners for whom He intended to die&mdash;23:34, 43.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s teaching in 6:17-49 gives us a clear view of the highest standard of morality:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Man-Savior has the kind of life described in verses 17 through 49.</li>
	<li>Actually, Christ Himself is the highest standard of morality, for He is the man created by God in Genesis 1:26 plus the tree of life mentioned in Genesis 2:9.</li>
	<li>The highest standard of morality is now a person living in us and making it possible for us to live Christ&mdash;Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:20-21a.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s teaching concerning the highest standard of morality is based on the divine life with its expression, the divine word&mdash;Luke 6:35, 47-48:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The living that is according to the highest standard of morality issues from the divine life with which we have been born of the Most High&mdash;v. 35.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word in verses 43 and 44 reveals life as the source and living as the issue; His disciples are the good trees with the divine life, and out from this life issues a living that is the expression of God.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word is the foundation of our being, behavior, and work&mdash;vv. 47-48.</li>
		<li>We can have the highest standard of morality by the divine life and through the divine word&mdash;John 6:63.</li>
		</ol></li>

5:15-16; 9:51-56; 10:25-42; 23:42-43</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Gospel of Luke unveils the God-man living of the Man-Savior as typified by the meal offering&mdash;Lev. 2:1-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The conception of the Savior was God&rsquo;s incarnation (the mingling of God and man as typified by the meal offering), constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, thus producing the God-man of two natures&mdash;divinity and humanity&mdash;vv. 4-5; John 1:14; Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Man-Savior is a genuine man with the real human nature and the perfect human virtues for the qualification to be man&rsquo;s Savior&mdash;1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 2:14; cf. John 19:5.</li>
		<li>He is also the complete God with the true divine nature and the excellent divine attributes to empower and ensure His ability to save man&mdash;Col. 2:9; 1 John 1:7; Acts 20:28.</li>
		<li>Christ expressed in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues, by which He attracted and captivated people, not by living His human life in the flesh but by living His divine life in resurrection&mdash;Matt. 4:18-22; 19:13-15; Mark 16:7; Luke 8:1-3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Fine flour, the main element of the meal offering, signifies Christ&rsquo;s humanity, which is fine, perfect, tender, balanced, and right in every way, with no excess and no deficiency; this signifies the beauty and excellence of Christ&rsquo;s human living and daily walk&mdash;Lev. 2:1; Luke 23:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He grew up in a family that was filled with the knowledge and love of God&rsquo;s holy Word, as indicated by Mary&rsquo;s receiving of God&rsquo;s word as the Lord&rsquo;s slave and her poetic praise filled with God&rsquo;s word&mdash;1:37-38, 46-55.</li>
		<li>While He was growing in stature as a man, He became strong in spirit; He was filled with the wisdom of His deity and needed the grace of God in His humanity&mdash;2:40, 52; cf. 1:80.</li>
		<li>At the age of twelve He cared for His Father&rsquo;s will, but at the same time He was subject to His parents&mdash;2:49, 51.</li>
		<li>He advanced in grace before God because He was growing in the expression of God according to God&rsquo;s desire, and He advanced in grace before men because He was growing in the divine attributes manifested in the human virtues; hence, He was growing as a God-man before God and men&mdash;v. 52.</li>
		<li>He spoke words of grace and showed His steadiness under the threatening of His opposers&mdash;4:21-22, 28-30.</li>
		<li>He was the exulting One and the weeping One; He exulted in the Holy Spirit for the will of God and wept for the city of Jerusalem&mdash;10:21; 19:41.</li>
		<li>When the Samaritans rejected Him, He desired to save them, and when people welcomed Him, He withdrew in the wilderness and prayed&mdash;9:51-56; 5:15-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The oil of the meal offering signifies the Spirit of God as the divine element of Christ&mdash;Lev. 2:1; Luke 1:35; 3:22; 4:18; Heb. 1:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He was born of the Spirit, and the Spirit descended upon Him as a dove&mdash;Luke 1:35; 3:21-22.</li>
		<li>He was full of the Spirit, led by the Spirit, in the power of the Spirit, and anointed with the Spirit&mdash;4:1, 14, 18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The frankincense in the meal offering signifies the fragrance of Christ in His resurrection; that the frankincense was put on the fine flour signifies that Christ&rsquo;s humanity bears the aroma of His resurrection&mdash;Lev. 2:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When the Lord was being arrested, Peter cut off the ear of the high priest&rsquo;s slave, but the Lord healed his ear and stopped the sword&mdash;Luke 22:50-51; John 18:11.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s Spirit-filled and resurrection-saturated living was a satisfying fragrance to God, giving God rest, peace, joy, enjoyment, and full satisfaction&mdash;Luke 3:22; 4:1; Lev. 2:1-2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Salt, with which the meal offering was seasoned, signifies the death, or the cross, of Christ; salt functions to season, kill germs, and preserve&mdash;v. 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus always lived a life of being salted, a life under the cross&mdash;Luke 12:49-50.</li>
		<li>Even before He was actually crucified, Christ daily lived a crucified life, denying Himself and His natural life and living the Father&rsquo;s life in resurrection as a man of prayer; prayer is the real denial of the self&mdash;3:21; 5:16; 6:12-13; 9:28-29; 23:34, 46.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The meal offering typifies our Christian life as a duplication of Christ&rsquo;s God-man living and our church life as the corporate living by the perfected God-men&mdash;Lev. 2:4; Psa. 92:10; 1 Pet. 2:21; Rom. 8:2-3, 11, 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we eat Christ as the meal offering, we will become what we eat and live by what we eat&mdash;John 6:57, 63; 1 Cor. 10:17; Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
		<li>The humanity of Jesus is in the Spirit of Jesus; if we drink of the Spirit of Jesus and feed upon the humanity of Jesus, we will become &ldquo;Jesusly&rdquo; human&mdash;John 6:57; 7:37-39; Acts 16:7; 1 Cor. 12:3b, 13; Num. 20:8.</li>
		<li>By exercising our spirit to touch the Spirit consolidated in the Word, we eat the human life and living of Jesus, we are constituted with Jesus, and the human living of Jesus becomes our human living&mdash;Eph. 6:17-18; Jer. 15:16; Gal. 6:17; Phil. 1:19-21a; cf. Isa. 7:14-15.</li>
		<li>Christ&rsquo;s life and our individual Christian life issue in a totality&mdash;the church life as a corporate meal offering; God desires that every local church be a meal offering to satisfy Him and fully supply the saints day by day&mdash;Lev. 2:1-2, 4; 1 Cor. 12:12, 24; 10:17; cf. Psa. 36:8-9; Rev. 2:7; 22:1-2a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Gospel of Luke unveils the ministry of the Man-Savior in His human virtues with His divine attributes:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Man-Savior healed the slave of the centurion, who saw that the Lord was a man under authority with the word of authority&mdash;7:1-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the Man-Savior&rsquo;s human virtue, as a man under authority, He was willing to go to the home of the centurion&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		<li>In the Man-Savior&rsquo;s divine attribute, He spoke the word of authority to heal the centurion&rsquo;s slave&mdash;vv. 7-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Man-Savior showed pity to a weeping widow by raising up her only son&mdash;vv. 11-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His human virtue of compassion, the Man-Savior spoke to the widow and touched the bier of the &ldquo;only son of his mother&rdquo; (v. 12); [note: He also healed the daughter of Jairus, his &ldquo;only daughter&rdquo; (8:42), and cast a demon out of a man&rsquo;s son, his &ldquo;only child&rdquo; (9:38)].</li>
		<li>His divine attributes were expressed in His human virtues by His raising the young man from the dead.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Man-Savior forgave a sinful woman&mdash;7:36-50:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s human virtues of affection, kindness, patience, mercy, and understanding were displayed in His fellowship with this woman.</li>
		<li>His divine attributes, especially the attributes of divine authority to forgive a person&rsquo;s sins and His giving of peace to the forgiven sinner, were also displayed&mdash;vv. 49-50.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Man-Savior presented the parable of the good Samaritan to signify the expression of His divine attributes with His human virtues&mdash;10:25-37:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Man-Savior, in His lost-one-seeking and sinner-saving ministry journey (19:10), came down to the place where the wounded victim of the Judaistic robbers lay in his miserable and dying condition.</li>
		<li>When the Man-Savior saw him, He was moved with compassion in His humanity with His divinity and rendered him tender healing and saving care, fully meeting his urgent need&mdash;10:33-35.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Man-Savior presented the parable of the prodigal son, showing His shepherding, seeking, and saving spirit with the Father&rsquo;s loving, forgiving, and compassionate heart&mdash;15:11-32; cf. 9:55-56:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A seeking saint should be poor in spirit and pure in heart, and a repentant believer should always have a willing spirit for the things of the Lord and for the church&mdash;Matt. 5:3, 8; Psa. 51:12; cf. Phil. 2:20-22.</li>
		<li>We must follow the steps of the processed Triune God in His seeking and saving fallen people according to His heavenly ministry of shepherding people with His saving love&mdash;Luke 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Man-Savior acted in His human virtues with the divine attributes in His word to the criminal on the cross&mdash;23:42-43:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When Christ was being crucified, one of the two criminals who were crucified with Him said, &ldquo;Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom&rdquo;&mdash;v. 42.</li>
		<li>Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise&rdquo;; this shows the divine attribute of His eternal and indiscriminate love expressed through His cherishing human virtue&mdash;v. 43.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to be one with the Man-Savior in His God-man living and ministry, we must sit at His feet and listen to His word so that we may be infused with His life for the expression of God and with His desire for our service to God unto the building of God&mdash;10:38-42; 1:53; 6:47-48.</li>

<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s God-man living constituted a prototype; this prototype is for the reproduction, the mass production, of the God-man in the believers&mdash;Luke 1:31-32, 35, 6:35; Rom. 8:29.</li>
<li>Christ, the unique prototype, has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as an extract of Himself&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Phil. 1:19b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is actually an extract of the all-inclusive Christ; thus, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit includes all that Christ is, all that He passed through, and all that He accomplished, attained, and obtained&mdash;Acts 16:7; Rom. 8:9; Phil. 1:19b.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s becoming the life-giving Spirit is related to the reproduction of the God-man; the God-man is reproduced by the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reproduction of the God-man requires that we be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit and that we be transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul&mdash;John 3:6b; 2 Cor. 3:18; Phil. 1:21a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first step in the reproduction of the God-man is that we must be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit with His divine life and nature&mdash;John 3:6b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The regenerating Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit&mdash;the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the extract of the all-inclusive, crucified and resurrected Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Phil. 1:19b:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The essence, elements, nature, and substance of Christ are all in the all-inclusive Spirit; it is by this Spirit that Christ, the God-man, is reproduced&mdash;1 John 2:20, 27; cf. Exo. 30:22-30.</li>
			<li>This Spirit includes the element of the Lord&rsquo;s life of expressing God, the element of the restored, recovered, strengthened, empowered, and uplifted human virtues, and the element of the Man-Savior&rsquo;s enriched and uplifted human virtues&mdash;Luke 7:11-17, 36-50.</li>
			<li>The Spirit as the extract of Christ contains the element of the highest standard of morality&mdash;1:35, 75-79.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>All the elements in the all-inclusive Spirit have been born into us through the Spirit&mdash;Acts 16:7; Rom. 8:9; Phil. 1:19b; John 3:6b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>For the reproduction of the God-man we need to be transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul with His divine attributes to uplift, strengthen, enrich, and fill our human virtues for His expression in our humanity&mdash;2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 12:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Regeneration is with the divine life and nature, but transformation is with the divine attributes to uplift, strengthen, enrich, and fill our human virtues for the Lord&rsquo;s expression in our humanity&mdash;Eph. 4:2, 20-21, 23.</li>
		<li>Transformation involves a metabolic change, an inward change in life&mdash;Rom. 12:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Such a metabolic change requires the working within us of the element of the divine life&mdash;8:2, 6, 10-11.</li>
			<li>This produces a change not only in appearance and behavior but also a change in life, nature, and intrinsic essence&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Those who are the reproduction of the God-man should live Christ as the God-man&mdash;Phil. 1:20b-21a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Gospel of Luke records the history of the God-man living of the first God-man; now this history needs to be written into our being&mdash;6:35; 2 Cor. 3:3.</li>
	<li>The Christ who lives in us is still the One who possesses the human virtues strengthened and enriched by the divine attributes&mdash;Gal. 2:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Christ who is being dispensed into us is a composition of the divine nature with its divine attributes and the human nature with its human virtues&mdash;4:19.</li>
		<li>Christ is now seeking to live in the believers the kind of life that He lived on earth; within us He is still living a life that is a composition of the divine attributes and the human virtues&mdash;John 14:19b; 2 Cor. 10:1; 11:10.</li>
		<li>Whoever lives Christ, the God-man, is His reproduction&mdash;a duplicate of the unique God-man, a reproduction of the prototype&mdash;Rom. 8:29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Luke we see how Christ was incarnated and lived the life of a God-man; in Philippians we see how Christ is lived out from us in order to have many duplicates of Himself&mdash;Luke 1:31-32; 6:35; Phil. 1:21a; 2:5-8; 3:9-10; 4:8, 13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul and Christ had one life and one living, living together as one person&mdash;1:21a.</li>
		<li>From the description in 2:5-8 we can see that the Christ in 1:21a is the God-man in 2:5-8; hence, to live Christ is to live the God-man.</li>
		<li>We live Christ as the God-man by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;1:19b.</li>
		<li>In order to live Christ as the God-man, we need to take His mind; to have His mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts&mdash;2:5; 1:8.</li>
		<li>As we live Christ as the God-man, we will &ldquo;shine as luminaries in the world, holding forth the word of life&rdquo;&mdash;2:15b-16a.</li>
		<li>If we would live Christ as the God-man, we must be found in Christ, know the power of His resurrection, and be conformed to His death&mdash;3:9-10.</li>
		<li>When we are found in Christ, living Him as the God-man, He will be expressed in our human virtues through His empowering&mdash;4:8, 13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The ultimate issue of the reproduction of the God-man is the church as the reproduction of God&mdash;a corporate God-man and the universal incorporation, consummating in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 4:24; John 14:20; Rev. 21:2, 7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The church, the Body of Christ, is the reproduction of God&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The God-man, through His death and resurrection, has made a mass reproduction of Himself&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 12:24.</li>
		<li>The church is God&rsquo;s expression, God&rsquo;s fullness, God&rsquo;s continuation, God&rsquo;s life-increase, God&rsquo;s spread, God&rsquo;s full growth, and God&rsquo;s rich surplus&mdash;<em>Hymns,</em> #203.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The one new man is the corporate God-man&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first God-man, the firstborn Son of God, is the Head of this corporate God-man, and the many God-men, the many sons of God, are the Body of this corporate God-man&mdash;Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:18; 2:19.</li>
		<li>In Christ God became man to produce a corporate God-man for the manifestation of God&mdash;1 Tim. 3:16; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s unlimited and infinite divine being with His divine life and glory was released through His death; the issue of this release was the producing of a universal incorporation of the consummated God and the regenerated believers&mdash;Luke 12:50; John 12:23-24; 14:10-11, 20.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem, as the consummation of the corporate God-man, is the aggregate, the totality, of the many God-men, who are the reproduction of the first God-man&mdash;the Man-Savior revealed in the Gospel of Luke&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 7.</li>

<li>The Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior&mdash;Luke 2:11; John 4:42:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord is the Savior of fallen mankind, based upon His person and redemptive work&mdash;Rom. 3:24; Eph. 1:6-7.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus is God becoming a man to be our Savior, and He has accomplished full salvation for us, the sinners, through which He may save us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and our fallen condition&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 4:42.</li>
	<li>What He is and what He has accomplished make Him competent to be the able Savior to save us to the uttermost from all our problems&mdash;Heb. 7:25.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus has been exalted to God&rsquo;s right hand as Savior&mdash;Acts 5:31:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus&rsquo; incarnation made Him a man, and His human living on earth qualified Him to be man&rsquo;s Savior&mdash;Luke 1:31-32, 35; 23:14-15.</li>
		<li>His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader that He might be the Savior&mdash;Acts 2:22-24, 32, 36; 5:31.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s exalting of Him was the ultimate step in His being perfected by God to be the Savior of man&mdash;Heb. 2:10; 5:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As the Savior, Christ Himself is the salvation prepared by God for us and given to us&mdash;Luke 2:30; 3:6; 19:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Zachariah&rsquo;s prophecy concerned God&rsquo;s redemptive move for His people unto their salvation, accomplished by the raising of Christ, in His humanity, as a horn of salvation in the house of David, and, in His divinity, as the rising sun from on high, through God&rsquo;s rich mercy according to His holy covenant&mdash;1:67-79.</li>
	<li>Jesus the Savior was the dawning sun to the dark age&mdash;v. 78:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>His coming ended the night of the Old Testament and began the day of the New Testament.</li>
		<li>As the fruit in Elizabeth&rsquo;s blessing, He is life to us&mdash;v. 42; John 14:6.</li>
		<li>As the sun in Zachariah&rsquo;s prophecy, He is light to us&mdash;Luke 1:78; John 9:5; Matt. 4:16.</li>
		<li>As such a One, He is the Accomplisher and the center of God&rsquo;s redemption that His people may obtain salvation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Savior is the salvation of God; when He comes, the salvation of God comes&mdash;Luke 3:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Salvation is God Himself; in the New Testament Jah Jehovah, who is salvation (Isa. 12:2), is Jesus, the incarnated God&mdash;Matt. 1:21; Luke 2:30.</li>
		<li>To see and receive the Man-Savior is to see and receive the salvation of God&mdash;19:1-3, 9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s highest standard of morality constitutes His qualification and the basic factor for His dynamic salvation&mdash;1:31-32, 35:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Man-Savior was conceived of God with His attributes to be the content and reality of His human virtues&mdash;v. 35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s human virtues are filled with the divine attributes&mdash;5:12-14.</li>
		<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s incarnation strengthened, enriched, and sanctified the human virtues and brought the divine attributes into the human virtues for the expression of God&mdash;10:25-37.</li>
		<li>When Christ became incarnated, He put on the human virtues, which were created by God for man so that man may express Him&mdash;Gen. 1:26.</li>
		<li>In the Man-Savior the divine attributes and the human virtues are mingled together as one; the divine attributes are in the human virtues, and the human virtues contain the divine attributes&mdash;Luke 1:35; 2:40, 52.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Man-Savior was born of the human essence with the human virtues in order to rescue these virtues from man&rsquo;s fall and to restore and recover man&rsquo;s virtues from the damage of man&rsquo;s fall&mdash;Matt. 1:18, 20; Luke 1:27, 31-32.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior was incarnated in order to uplift the human virtues to the highest standard&mdash;to the standard that matches the attributes of God for the expression of God&mdash;Matt. 5:20.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s incarnation produced the highest standard of morality, and this morality is for the saving power of His dynamic salvation&mdash;Luke 1:35:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In order to save us, God came into man, bringing God&rsquo;s attributes into man&rsquo;s virtues; He lived the life of a God-man, with the divine attributes filling His human virtues; and then He died on the cross and was resurrected&mdash;23:33-34; 24:1-7, 26, 36-40.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit, and as the Spirit He enters into us to bring God into our being and to fill our virtues with the divine attributes&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; Eph. 3:16-17a.</li>
		<li>When He saves us, He comes into us as the One with the human virtues filled with the divine attributes; such a life saves us from within and uplifts our human virtues, restoring and transforming us&mdash;Rom. 12:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The highest standard of morality constitutes the qualification for the Man-Savior&rsquo;s dynamic salvation; the best illustration is the parable of the good Samaritan, which shows that this Samaritan lived the highest standard of morality and saved the fallen one by His standard of morality&mdash;Luke 10:25-37.</li>
	<li>The highest standard of morality also constitutes the basic factor for the Man-Savior&rsquo;s dynamic salvation; we see this in the case of Zaccheus&mdash;19:1-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When the Man-Savior came to the house of Zaccheus (v. 5), He came with the Spirit of power and with the indestructible eternal life to impart into him at his believing in Him&mdash;4:18; Heb. 7:16; John 3:15.</li>
		<li>The Spirit with the eternal life as the divine electricity was within the Lord&rsquo;s humanity of the highest standard; when He looked at Zaccheus and talked to him, the Spirit with His eternal life entered into him, and Zaccheus responded&mdash;Luke 19:6-9.</li>
		<li>Our resurrected, ascended, and God-exalted Savior is like an immense magnet drawing people to Himself, and we have been drawn by His dynamic saving power&mdash;Heb. 12:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s dynamic saving power is constituted of His highest standard of morality in which His powerful Spirit and eternal life are; how we need this Man-Savior with His dynamic salvation!</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>The Gospel of Luke is rich in revelation concerning the kingdom of God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;The Lord God will give to Him the throne of David His father, and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end&rdquo;&mdash;1:32b-33; 2 Sam. 7:13, 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus will have the house of Jacob&mdash;the nation of Israel&mdash;as the center of His reign (Acts 1:6; 15:16), through which He will rule over the entire world as His kingdom (Rev. 11:15), first in the millennium (20:4, 6) and then in the new heaven and new earth for eternity (22:3, 5).</li>
		<li>Christ, who is intimately related to David (Ezek. 34:23; Matt. 1:1; 12:1-4; Luke 1:32), will reign as King in the tent of David in the coming age during the restoration of Israel; the Christ who will reign in the millennial kingdom is actually Jehovah of hosts, and Christ&rsquo;s reigning in the tent of David signifies consolation, encouragement, and restoration (Isa. 16:5; 24:23; Acts 15:16; cf. 2 Cor. 1:3-5).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;I must announce the gospel of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this I was sent&rdquo;&mdash;Luke 4:43:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom of God is the Savior as the seed of life sown into His believers, God&rsquo;s chosen people, and developing into a realm over which God can rule as His kingdom in His divine life&mdash;17:21; Mark 4:3, 26.</li>
		<li>The entrance into the kingdom of God is regeneration, and the development of the kingdom is the believers&rsquo; growth in the divine life&mdash;John 3:5; 2 Pet. 1:3-11.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live, and it will develop into the coming kingdom as a reward to be inherited by the overcoming saints in the millennium&mdash;Rom. 14:17; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>
		<li>Eventually, the kingdom of God will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God&rsquo;s eternal life, which all God&rsquo;s redeemed will enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity&mdash;21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God is what the Savior announced as the gospel, the good news, to those who were alienated from the life of God&mdash;Eph. 4:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God&rdquo;&mdash;Luke 8:10a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s economy concerning the kingdom was a hidden mystery (Rom. 16:25-26; Eph. 3:3), which was unveiled to the disciples.</li>
		<li>Because the nature and character of the kingdom of God are wholly divine, and the elements through which it is brought forth are the divine life and the divine light, the kingdom of God, especially in its reality as the genuine church in this age (Rom. 14:17), is still entirely a mystery to the natural man (1 Cor. 2:14); divine revelation is required to understand it.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;They will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table in the kingdom of God&rdquo;&mdash;Luke 13:29:

		<li><em>You may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom</em> (v. 30) refers to the feast in Matthew 22:1-4 and the marriage feast in Revelation 19:9, which is for the overcoming saints.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;The kingdom of God does not come with observation...For behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you&rdquo;&mdash;Luke 17:20b, 21b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word here indicates that the kingdom of God is not material but spiritual; it is the Savior in His first coming (vv. 21-22), in His second coming (vv. 23-30), in the rapture of His overcoming believers (vv. 31-36), and in His destroying of the Antichrist (v. 37) to recover the whole earth for His reign there (Rev. 11:15).</li>

<h1 class="title">The Jubilee (1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 25:8-17; Isa. 61:1-3;<br />
Luke 4:16-22; Acts 26:16-19</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The year of jubilee in Leviticus 25:8-17 is recorded as a prophecy in Isaiah 61:1-3 and is fulfilled in reality in Luke 4:16-22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the year of jubilee there were two main blessings: the returning of every man to his lost possession and the liberation from slavery&mdash;Lev. 25:8-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the year of jubilee everyone who had sold his possession, his allotted portion of the good land, was returned to it without paying anything to redeem it (vv. 10, 13, 28), and everyone who had sold himself into slavery regained his freedom and returned to his family (vv. 39-41).</li>
		<li>Returning to one&rsquo;s possession and being freed and returning to one&rsquo;s family signify that in the New Testament jubilee the believers have returned to God as their lost divine possession, have been released from all bondage, and have returned to the church as their divine family&mdash;Eph. 1:13-14; John 8:32, 36; cf. Psa. 68:5-6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the Old Testament type the jubilee lasted for one year, but in the fulfillment it refers to the entire New Testament age, the age of grace, as the time when God accepts the returned captives of sin (Isa. 49:8; Luke 15:17-24; 2 Cor. 6:2) and when those oppressed under the bondage of sin enjoy the release of God&rsquo;s salvation (Rom. 7:14&mdash;8:2).</li>
	<li>The believers&rsquo; enjoyment of the jubilee in the age of grace (their enjoyment of Christ as God&rsquo;s grace to them) will issue in the full enjoyment of the jubilee in the millennium and in the fullest enjoyment in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth&mdash;John 1:16-17; Rom. 5:17; Phil. 3:14; Rev. 22:1-2a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The year of jubilee is the age of Christ as grace dispensed into us for our enjoyment by His words of grace; the New Testament jubilee is an age of ecstasy for our salvation&mdash;Luke 4:22; Psa. 45:2; John 1:14-17; 2 Cor. 6:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Testament age is an age of ecstasy, and a Christian is a person in ecstasy; if we have never been in ecstasy before God, this shows that we do not have a sufficient enjoyment of God&mdash;5:13; Acts 11:5; 22:17; Psa. 43:4a; 51:12; 1 Pet. 1:8; Isa. 12:3-6.</li>
	<li><em>Jubilee</em> means having no worry or anxiety, no concern or care, no lack or shortage, no sickness or calamity, and no problems whatsoever, but rather having all benefits; hence, all things are pleasant and satisfying to our heart, and we are free from anxiety, at ease, excited, and exultant.</li>
	<li>We must receive the Lord Jesus as the real jubilee in us; if we have Him, we have God as our possession and can be delivered from the bondage of sin and Satan to have real freedom and rest&mdash;Acts 26:18; Eph. 1:13-14; Col. 1:12; Matt. 11:28; John 8:32, 36:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we receive Christ as our Savior and life, He comes into us to be our jubilee, but unless we allow Him to live in us and unless we live by Him, we are not practically living in the jubilee&mdash;vv. 11-12.</li>
		<li>If our heart is set on any person, thing, or matter other than the Lord, this is idolatry, and the end is wretchedness&mdash;1 John 5:21; cf. Ezek. 14:3, 5; 6:9.</li>
		<li>If we allow Christ to live in us and we live by Him, everything is to our satisfaction; otherwise, everything is a problem, and nothing is a jubilee.</li>

	<li>Everything can be satisfying to us only after we have gained the all-inclusive Christ as our enjoyment; it is not outward persons, matters, or things but Christ within us who enables us to be calm and free of worries as we face all kinds of situations&mdash;Phil. 3:8-9; 4:5-8, 11-13.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The proclamation of the jubilee in Luke 4 governs the central thought of the whole Gospel of Luke, and the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15 is an excellent illustration of the jubilee&mdash;vv. 11-32:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The prodigal son left his father&rsquo;s house, selling his possession and himself:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The content of a vessel is its possession, and man is a vessel of God; hence, if man does not have God as his possession and enjoyment, he is empty and poor&mdash;Rom. 9:21-23; Eph. 2:12; Psa. 16:5; Rev. 3:17-18.</li>
		<li>Adam lost his portion of the enjoyment of God when he did not take the tree of life; all the unbelieving people of the world have lost God as their possession and enjoyment and have sold their members to sin to become slaves of sin&mdash;Eph. 2:12; Rom. 7:14; 6:19.</li>
		<li>Human life is nothing but labor and sorrow and will soon be gone; the true condition of human life is vanity of vanities, emptiness of emptinesses&mdash;a chasing after wind&mdash;Psa. 90:10; 73:14, 16-17, 25; Eccl. 1:2-11, 14.</li>
		<li>Fallen people have no real dwelling place; they are drifting about and wandering without a home, because God is man&rsquo;s real dwelling place&mdash;Psa. 90:1; Gen. 28:17-19; John 15:4; Matt. 11:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>One day the prodigal son returned to his possession and his father&rsquo;s house; that was a jubilee, a liberation, and everything became pleasant and satisfying&mdash;Luke 15:20, 24; cf. Lev. 25:11-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In redemption God is our possession for our enjoyment; to be saved is to return to our inheritance, to return to God, to come back to God and enjoy Him anew as our possession&mdash;Eph. 1:13-14.</li>
		<li>To be saved is to gain God; when we have God, we have everything; without God, we have nothing&mdash;Col. 1:12; <em>Hymns,</em> #1080.</li>
		<li>God has become our blessed portion in Christ, but many Christians are unhappy and are like lights that do not shine, because they do not &ldquo;turn on the switch&rdquo; by taking God as their portion&mdash;Eph. 4:18; Phil. 2:12-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The father&rsquo;s acceptance of the son and the son&rsquo;s returning to his father and his father&rsquo;s house were the year of jubilee to the son, the year of grace&mdash;Luke 15:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God in Christ has become the fattened calf for the enjoyment of the repentant and returned prodigal sons&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		<li>This corresponds to Leviticus 25:11-12, which says that the people were neither to sow nor reap in the year of the jubilee but only to eat and enjoy; once we repent and return to God by receiving the Lord Jesus, we obtain God within, and this is the beginning of our jubilee.</li>
		<li>We are not the Father&rsquo;s hired servants but His enjoying sons, and we can continually enjoy God as our possession from now unto eternity.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 25:8-17; Isa. 61:1-3;<br />
Luke 4:16-22; Acts 26:16-19</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="4">
<li>Announcing the gospel to the poor, proclaiming release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, and sending away in release those who are oppressed are the freedoms and blessings of the jubilee&mdash;Luke 4:18-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>jubilee</em> in Leviticus 25:10 means &ldquo;a time of shouting,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a time of the trumpeting of the ram&rsquo;s horn&rdquo;; the trumpeting of the ram&rsquo;s horn signifies the preaching of the gospel as the proclaiming of liberty in the New Testament jubilee to all the sinners sold under sin that they may return to God and God&rsquo;s family, the household of God, and may rejoice with shouting in the New Testament enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;Luke 4:16-22; Acts 26:16-19.</li>
	<li>Our preaching of the gospel is our blowing of the trumpet of redemption to proclaim to the world, &ldquo;Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation,&rdquo; the year of jubilee&mdash;2 Cor. 6:2; Isa. 61:1-3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When God created man, He intended to give Himself in Christ to man as man&rsquo;s possession, man&rsquo;s inheritance (Gen. 2:9; 13:12-15; Psa. 16:5; 90:1); however, man became fallen, and in the fall man lost God as his possession (Gen. 3:24; 4:16; Eph. 2:12) and sold himself into slavery under sin, Satan, and the world (John 8:34; Rom. 7:14b; Gal. 4:8; Titus 3:3; 1 John 5:19b).</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament salvation, accomplished by God&rsquo;s grace based on His redemption in Christ (Rom. 3:24; 5:1-2; Eph. 2:8), brings fallen man back to God as His divine possession (Acts 26:18; Gal. 3:14; Eph. 1:14; Col. 1:12; Luke 15:12-24), releases man from slavery under sin, Satan, and the world (John 8:32; Rom. 6:6, 14; 8:2; Heb. 2:14-15; John 12:31), and restores man to his divine family, the household of God (Gal. 6:10; Eph. 2:19), that he may enjoy fellowship in God&rsquo;s grace (2 Cor. 13:14).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s salvation causes us to have real freedom; our possession is God, and our freedom comes from our enjoyment of God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If man does not enjoy God, he cannot have real freedom; freedom means release, to be freed from all bondage, all heavy burden, all oppression, and all enslavement&mdash;John 8:32, 36; Gal. 5:1; 2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
	<li>Everything in our life can be a bondage to us, and we can be slaves under any matter&mdash;John 8:34; cf. 1 Cor. 6:12.</li>
	<li>First, Satan captured us; then he came to dwell in us as the inciter, the instigator, of our sins; the result is that he has become our illegal master, and we have become his captives to the extent that we are unable to do good and can only commit sins&mdash;Rom. 7:14; 1 John 5:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If a man does not have God, whatever he tries to enjoy apart from God is dog food, refuse, and dung&mdash;Phil. 3:7-9; cf. 2 Pet. 2:22.</li>
		<li>Satan is called Beelzebul, which means &ldquo;the lord of the dunghill,&rdquo; from <em>Beelzebub,</em> meaning &ldquo;the lord of flies&rdquo;; Satan specializes in leading sinners like flies to feed on dung&mdash;Matt. 10:25; 12:24, 27; 2 Kings 1:2.</li>
		<li>Although deep in his heart no one wants to sin, eventually everyone sins; no one has control over himself, and everyone has become a slave of sin&mdash;Rom. 7:18-23; John 8:34.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s desperate cry in Romans 7:24 is answered in Romans 8:2, which says that the law of the Spirit of life frees us in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</li>
	<li>We can be released and have real freedom only by enjoying Christ as the life-giving Spirit; only those who enjoy God do not commit sin and are really free, living a life of liberty, release, and freedom from bondage&mdash;John 8:36:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The law of the Spirit of life releases us from the law of sin and of death; this law is the Lord Himself, who passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:2.</li>
		<li>If we do not enjoy the Lord sufficiently, we will still be in bondage to many things; making up our mind will not work; we must continually come to the Lord to eat and enjoy Him&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9; Rev. 2:7; Isa. 55:1-2.</li>
		<li>Only those who enjoy God do not practice sin and are really free&mdash;John 8:11-12, 24, 28, 31-36.</li>
		<li>Christ as the jubilee frees us from our poverty, captivity, blindness, and oppression&mdash;Eccl. 1:2, 14; 3:11; Phil. 3:8; 2 Pet. 2:22; Luke 12:21; Rev. 3:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The living of the jubilee is a living in the enjoyment of Christ, a living of enjoying God as our inheritance and real freedom&mdash;Acts 26:18; John 8:36:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be in the jubilee is to eat the Lord Jesus as the real produce of the good land, take Him as our dwelling place for our rest, and be freed from the slavery of sin and from the bondage of law and religion&mdash;6:57; Deut. 8:7-10; Col. 1:12; John 15:5; Psa. 16:5; 90:1; Rom. 6:6-7; Gal. 5:1.</li>
	<li>The only way to be released from the three kinds of labor in human life&mdash;the labor to be a good person, the labor of anxiety, and the labor of suffering&mdash;is to take Christ as our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest&mdash;Rom. 7:24&mdash;8:2; Phil. 4:5-7; 2 Cor. 12:9.</li>
	<li>The Christian life should be a life full of enjoying the Lord, a life full of joy and praises; when we enjoy the Lord fully, He becomes our jubilee:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The tone of an overcoming living is the tone of rejoicing, thanking, and praising God continually&mdash;1 Thes. 5:16-18.</li>
		<li>The overcoming life can survive only in an environment of thanksgiving and praise&mdash;v. 18; Col. 3:17; Psa. 106:12; 2 Chron. 20:20-22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The living of the jubilee is a life in which we take God Himself, Christ Himself, in every situation; then He becomes the primary factor and center in us to lead us and overrule all the troubles of human life&mdash;John 6:16-21; Col. 1:17b, 18b.</li>
	<li>Paul learned the secret of living in the jubilee, the secret of gaining Christ in any kind of environment&mdash;Phil. 4:5-7, 11-13.</li>
	<li>Because everything is under His sovereignty, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, fill me, gain me, and possess me. No matter what my outward situation is, I just want to enjoy You.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>We need to be today&rsquo;s ministers and witnesses by living and proclaiming the gospel&mdash;Christ as the jubilee of grace&mdash;for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Acts 26:16-19.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Man-Savior&rsquo;s Teaching on Prayer<br />
for the Church to Be a House of Prayer</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 5:16; 6:12; 9:28-29; 11:1-13;<br />
18:1-17, 25-27; 19:46; 22:31-32, 39-41</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Man-Savior was a man of prayer (Luke 3:21-22; 5:16; 6:12; 9:16, 23-24, 28-29; 22:31-32, 39-41, 44; 23:34, 46-47; Psa. 102:7; 109:4), who taught His disciples concerning prayer for the church as the Father&rsquo;s house to be a house of prayer (Luke 19:46; cf. 2:49); when the disciples saw the Lord praying, they asked Him to teach them to pray (11:1):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To pray is to realize that we are nothing and can do nothing; prayer is the real denial and repudiating of our self for the enjoyment of Christ as our jubilee&mdash;Col. 4:2; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:3; 4:6-7, 11-13.</li>
	<li>Prayer means that we pray ourselves into God; to pray ourselves into God is to love Him by setting our entire being absolutely on Him according to Mary&rsquo;s pattern of sitting at the Lord&rsquo;s feet and listening to His word&mdash;Luke 10:38-42.</li>
	<li>If we pray according to the Lord&rsquo;s instructions in Luke 11:2-4, the result will be that we pray ourselves into God&mdash;6:37; Matt. 6:12-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Often in our experience we are distracted from God; we do not stay in God&mdash;we do not remain in Him; this is why we need to pray ourselves into God.</li>
		<li>Because we are easily distracted from God, we should spend time every morning with Him, praying ourselves into Him&mdash;Psa. 5:3; Isa. 50:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we pray ourselves into God, we receive His riches (represented by the loaves, the fish, and the egg) into our being for our supply&mdash;Luke 11:5-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Loaves represent the riches of the land; fish, the riches of the sea; and eggs, the riches of something both in the air and on the earth; the Holy Spirit is the totality of these riches.</li>
		<li>When we have prayed ourselves into God to remain in Him, we receive the Holy Spirit as our life supply (signified by the loaves, the fish, and the egg) so that we can feed ourselves and all those under our care&mdash;cf. 6:45.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we pray ourselves into God and receive His rich supply, which is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit as the reality of the unsearchable riches of Christ, we are filled and occupied with this supply so that there is no room in us for demons, evil spirits, or darkness&mdash;11:14.</li>
	<li>Because we are filled with the riches of the divine supply, we become persons whose hearts are full of light, not having any dark part, and we can illumine others&mdash;vv. 33-36; Matt. 5:8.</li>
	<li>This light then brings us into Christ as the One who has passed through death and entered into resurrection so that we may experience Him as the real Jonah and the real Solomon&mdash;Luke 11:29-32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ as the real Jonah was buried in the heart of the earth for three days and then resurrected to become a sign to this generation for salvation&mdash;Matt. 12:39-41; Jonah 1:2, 17; 3:2-10.</li>
		<li>Christ as the real Solomon is building the church, making it the temple of God, and is speaking the word of the wisdom of God&mdash;Matt. 12:42; 1 Kings 6:2; 10:23-24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In Him as the real Solomon we know the wisdom of God, the eternal purpose of God, and the economy of God.</li>
			<li>The &ldquo;wisdom of Solomon&rdquo; (Luke 11:31) indicates the mysteries revealed in the fourteen Epistles of Paul concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, concerning Christ as the expression of God with the church as the expression of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 1:24, 30; 2:7-10; Eph. 3:8-11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By praying ourselves into God to be filled with the riches of His supply, we experience the Man-Savior in His divine attributes and human virtues so that we may live a life that is the highest standard of morality in order to enjoy and proclaim Christ as the reality of the New Testament jubilee&mdash;Luke 4:18-22; 9:54-56; 19:10.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Man-Savior teaches us in a parable about persistent prayer&mdash;18:1-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In this parable the righteous God is likened to an unrighteous judge, and the believers in Christ are likened to a widow&mdash;vv. 2-3, 6.</li>
	<li>In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their Husband, Christ (2 Cor. 11:2), is absent from them (cf. Rev. 18:7).</li>
	<li>Although God does not seem to do anything on behalf of His persecuted people, we must learn to be a bothering widow, one who prays to God persistently&mdash;Luke 18:3-5; Isa. 62:6.</li>
	<li>By faith the martyrs experienced God&rsquo;s peaceful silence, exercising faith in God even when He did nothing to deliver them&mdash;Heb. 11:32-39; Matt. 11:6.</li>
	<li>We believers in Christ have an opponent, Satan the devil, concerning whom we need God&rsquo;s avenging; we ought to pray persistently for this avenging and should not lose heart (Luke 18:1, 3); this kind of persistent prayer is also carried out by the souls of the martyred saints (Rev. 6:9-10).</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s avenging us of our enemy will take place at the Savior&rsquo;s coming back (2 Thes. 2:6-9); the persistent and subjective faith for persistent prayer, like the faith of the widow, is the divine requirement for the overcomers to meet Christ in His triumphant return&mdash;Luke 18:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s story of the prayer of the Pharisee and the tax collector instructs us how to humble ourselves before God in prayer so that we may be justified by God and enter into the kingdom of God&mdash;vv. 9-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Pharisee actually &ldquo;prayed...to himself&rdquo; (v. 11), and in his prayer to himself he was accusing others and arrogantly boasting to God; such arrogant boasting is an utterly detestable sin (vv. 9-12).</li>
	<li>The tax collector realized how his sinfulness offended God; hence, he asked God to be propitiated, to be appeased toward him by a propitiatory sacrifice for sins, that God might be merciful and gracious to him&mdash;vv. 13-14; Rom. 3:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To repent and confess our sins are to humble ourselves; we need to humble ourselves to such an extent that we consider ourselves nobody and nothing&mdash;Psa. 51; Gal. 6:3; cf. 1 Cor. 8:1-3.</li>
		<li>After humbling ourselves, we need to become like a little child; a little child, not filled with and occupied by old concepts, can easily receive a new thought; hence, people need to be like little children and, with an unoccupied heart, receive the kingdom of God as a new thing&mdash;Luke 18:15-17; 10:21-22; Matt. 5:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By praying ourselves into God and humbling ourselves before God in prayer, we are empowered in Christ to repudiate ourselves, renounce all our material possessions, and follow the Man-Savior&mdash;Luke 18:18-30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By our human life this is impossible, but in the New Testament age whenever we touch God and have fellowship with God, all our impossibilities become possibilities, and all our inabilities become abilities&mdash;vv. 25-27; Phil. 4:11-13; John 15:5.</li>
		<li>By praying ourselves into God, we are empowered to overcome the stupefying effect of the self-indulgent living in this age, and we live in the reality of the economy of God to become rich toward God for the kingdom of God&mdash;Luke 12:13-21; 2 Cor. 6:10.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>If we want to save our soul-life, we will lose it, but if we lose our soul-life for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we will save it&mdash;Matt. 10:39; Luke 9:23-25; 14:26-35:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In 9:23-25 the Lord Jesus taught the disciples to take up their cross and follow Him by denying their soul-life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To save the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and to escape suffering; to lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to lose its enjoyment and thereby to suffer&mdash;Matt. 16:25.</li>
		<li>To lose the soul-life is to lose the enjoyment of the soul, and to save the soul-life means to preserve the soul in its enjoyment&mdash;Mark 8:35.</li>
		<li>To deny the self is to reject the soul&rsquo;s desire, preference, and choice&mdash;Luke 9:23.</li>
		<li>We must deny our soul, our soulish life, with all its pleasures in this age, so that we may gain it in the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming age&mdash;1 Pet. 1:9.</li>
		<li>If we allow our soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we will cause our soul to have its enjoyment in the kingdom age; we will share the Lord&rsquo;s joy in ruling over the earth&mdash;Matt. 25:21, 23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Luke 14:26-35 the Lord teaches us to be absolute in following Him and to hate everything, even our own soul-life, that distracts, hinders, and frustrates us from following Him faithfully:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the salt of the earth (Matt. 5:13), the believers&rsquo; taste depends on their renouncing of the earthly things&mdash;Luke 14:33-34.</li>
		<li>Believers may lose their taste&mdash;their function in the kingdom of God&mdash;by not being willing to renounce all the things of the present life&mdash;v. 34.</li>
		<li>If the believers lose their taste, their function, they will be fit neither for the land, signifying the church as God&rsquo;s farm (1 Cor. 3:9), which issues in the coming kingdom (Rev. 11:15), nor for the manure pile, signifying hell, the filthy place in the universe (21:8); having been saved from eternal perdition but being unfit for the coming kingdom, they will be thrown out from the glory of the kingdom in the millennium and be put aside for discipline&mdash;Luke 14:35.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>If we lose our soul-life, we may participate in the rapture of the overcomers&mdash;17:26-36; 21:34-36:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to participate in the rapture of the overcomers that we may enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (presence, coming) and escape the great tribulation, we must overcome the stupefying effect of man&rsquo;s living today&mdash;17:26-30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The conditions of evil living that stupefied the generation of Noah before the deluge and the generation of Lot before the destruction of Sodom portray the perilous condition of man&rsquo;s living before the Lord&rsquo;s parousia and the great tribulation&mdash;Matt. 24:3, 21.</li>
		<li>As followers of the Lord Jesus, we need to overcome the stupefying effect of the world&rsquo;s indulgent living by losing our soul-life in this age&mdash;Luke 17:31-33.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Preserving the soul-life is related to lingering in the earthly and material things&mdash;vv. 31, 33:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We linger in the earthly things because we care for our soul&rsquo;s enjoyment in the present age&mdash;cf. 2 Tim. 4:10.</li>
		<li>Lot&rsquo;s wife became a pillar of salt because she took a lingering look backward at Sodom, indicating that she loved and treasured the evil world that God was going to judge and utterly destroy&mdash;Luke 17:32:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>She was rescued from Sodom, but she did not reach the safe place that Lot reached&mdash;Gen. 19:15-30.</li>
			<li>Although she did not perish, she was not fully saved, but, like the salt that becomes tasteless (Luke 14:34-35), she was left in a place of shame; this is a solemn warning to the world-loving believers&mdash;1 John 2:15-17, 28.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Lingering in the earthly things for the sake of our soul&rsquo;s enjoyment will cause us to lose our soul; that is, our soul will suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age&mdash;Luke 17:33.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Luke 17:31-36 speaks of our reaction to the rapture call:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>These verses depict the soul-life in its engagement not with sinful things but with the things of earth; the Lord&rsquo;s charge here is related to the believers&rsquo; overcoming in their practical life&mdash;vv. 34-36.</li>
		<li>Whether or not the living believers participate in the rapture of the overcomers depends on their reaction to the call to go; the rapture will occur secretly and unexpectedly&mdash;v. 31:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>This call will not produce a miraculous last-minute change in us that has no relation to our previous life with the Lord.</li>
			<li>In that moment we will discover our heart&rsquo;s real treasure; if this treasure is the Lord Himself, there will be no backward look&mdash;v. 32.</li>
			<li>We need the cross to work in us a thorough detachment in spirit from everything and everyone other than the Lord Himself&mdash;v. 31.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Certain ones are taken because they have overcome the stupefying effect of self-indulgent living in this age to be raptured into the enjoyment of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia&mdash;vv. 26-30, 34-36.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 21:34-36 the Lord Jesus warns us to take heed to ourselves and to be watchful at every time, beseeching that we would &ldquo;prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man&rdquo;:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Prevail</em> here means to have strength and ability; the strength and ability to escape the great tribulation come from watching and beseeching&mdash;v. 36.</li>
		<li><em>Escape</em> refers to being raptured before the great tribulation&mdash;Matt. 24:21.</li>
		<li><em>All these things which are about to happen</em> are all the things of the great tribulation.</li>
		<li><em>Stand before the Son of Man</em> corresponds with <em>standing</em> in Revelation 14:1, indicating that the raptured overcomers will stand before the Savior on Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation.</li>

	<li>In order to enter into His life-dispensing resurrection, the Man-Savior died an all-inclusive death with a sevenfold status: the Lamb of God (John 1:29), a man in the flesh (Rom. 8:3), a man in the old creation (1 Cor. 15:45), the bronze serpent (John 3:14), the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15), the Peacemaker (Eph. 2:15), and a grain of wheat (John 12:24).</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection was God&rsquo;s vindication and approval of His person and His all-inclusive redemptive work by His death; His resurrection was also His success in all His achievements&mdash;Acts 2:24; 3:15; 4:10; 5:30; 10:40; 13:30, 33-34, 37; 17:31; 26:8; John 10:17-18; Rom. 4:25.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection was His victory over death, including Satan, Hades, and the grave&mdash;Acts 2:24; Phil. 3:10a; Rom. 6:9; 2 Tim. 1:10; Heb. 2:14; 1 John 3:8; Rev. 1:18; cf. 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection was His glorification&mdash;John 12:23-24; 13:31-32; 17:1; Luke 24:26; 12:49-50.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection was His birth as the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into the believers&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; John 14:16-20.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection was His germination of the new creation to impart the divine life into His believers for their regeneration as the many sons of God&mdash;12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3; John 1:13; 3:15-16; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:10.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection was His propagation to produce the church as His reproduction&mdash;John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17; Eph. 1:20-23.</li>
	<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection issues in His living within us; He lives in us so that we may live by Him to be His reproduction&mdash;John 14:19-20; Gal. 2:20.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection began while He was dying, just as the resurrection of a grain of wheat begins with its death; while He was dying outwardly, He was rising up inwardly&mdash;John 12:24; 1 Pet. 3:18:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>On the one hand, the Man-Savior was living to die (Luke 12:49-50), and on the other hand, He was dying to live (1 Cor. 15:35-36).</li>
	<li>Before His actual death, Christ was the resurrection (John 11:25); while He was living in the human life, He was resurrecting by dying; He is the dying-to-live Man-Savior and also the living-by-dying Man-Savior:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The death of Christ means that when Christ lived on this earth, He was always rejecting Himself; He lived a life of denying Himself and living by the Father&mdash;6:57; 5:19; 4:34; 17:4; 14:10, 24; 5:30; 7:18.</li>
		<li>He lived a life that had the manger at the beginning and the cross at the ending (Luke 2:12; 23:23-46); by being baptized, He recognized and declared that as a man in the flesh, in His humanity (John 1:14; Rom. 8:3), He was good for nothing but death and burial (Matt. 3:13-17).</li>
		<li>He had a very holy, pure human life, but He did not live by that life; He put that life aside, put that life to death, and lived by the Father&rsquo;s life:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>His &ldquo;looking up to heaven&rdquo; means that He was one with the Father, trusting in the Father as the source of blessing&mdash;Luke 9:16; John 10:30.</li>
			<li>He did not do anything from Himself (5:19), He did not seek His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him (v. 30b), and He did not seek His own glory but the glory of the Father who sent Him (7:18).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When we were regenerated by the resurrected Man-Savior as the life-giving Spirit, we were &ldquo;born crucified&rdquo;; now that we have been &ldquo;regenerated crucified,&rdquo; we are dying to live and living by dying&mdash;3:5-6; Gal. 2:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Dying to live</em> means to live under the crucifixion of Christ; on the one hand, Paul had been terminated, crucified, but on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one who had been regenerated, still lived; Christ lived in him, and he lived Christ&mdash;v. 20; Phil. 1:21a.</li>
	<li>Just as Christ, the one grain as the prototype, fell into the earth to die, we, the many grains as the mass reproduction, should follow Him to fall into the earth to die by continually exercising to reject the self and live by another life, the life of the Man-Savior&mdash;John 12:24-26; Luke 9:23-25; Col. 3:4a.</li>
	<li>When we do not live by our natural life but live by Him as the life within us, we are in resurrection; we die to live Him, and He lives by our dying&mdash;Gal. 2:20; 6:17; 1 Cor. 15:31, 36.</li>
	<li>We must follow the pattern of the Lord Jesus, who lived a crucified life to express the divine life, living out the divine attributes as His human virtues; to follow Him intrinsically as our indwelling model is to bear in our body the brands of Jesus by the grace of Christ&mdash;1 Pet. 2:21; Gal. 6:17-18.</li>
	<li>We must enjoy the precious death of Christ with its sweetness and effectiveness and the precious resurrection of Christ with its repelling power in Christ as the compound Spirit for the church life&mdash;Exo. 30:22-25; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 14:17-18; cf. Deut. 8:7-8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>By the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, we are enabled to die daily, to take up our cross daily, being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death by the Spirit as the power and riches of His resurrection for the sake of His Body&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 1 Cor. 15:31; Luke 9:23; cf. S. S. 2:8-14; Hosea 6:1-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The reality of resurrection is the pneumatic Christ, who as the consummated Spirit indwells and is mingled with our spirit&mdash;John 20:22; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17.</li>
	<li>It is in such a mingled spirit that we participate in and experience the resurrection of Christ, which enables us to be one with the cross to be delivered from the self and to be transformed into a new man in God&rsquo;s new creation for the fulfillment of the economy of God in the building up of the organic Body of Christ&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 4, 6, 13; 12:1-2, 11.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Ascension of the Man-Savior<br />
and His Heavenly Ministry</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 1:78-79; 2:8-14, 32; 7:41-42, 50;<br />
10:25-37; 15:3-32; 17:20-24; 24:27, 44-53</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Man-Savior&rsquo;s ascension was His inauguration into His heavenly office through the process of creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection as God and man, as the Creator and the creature, and as the Redeemer, the Savior, and the life-giving Spirit, to execute God&rsquo;s administration and to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Luke 24:44-53; Acts 2:36; Heb. 2:9; 12:2.</li>
<li>Christ in His ascension transcended Hades (where the dead people are being held), the earth (where the fallen men are moving against God), the air (where Satan and his power of darkness are acting against God), and all the heavens (where Satan can go)&mdash;Eph. 1:20-21; 4:8-10; Heb. 4:14; 7:26.</li>
<li>There is a transmission from the ascended and transcending Christ to the church (Eph. 1:19-23); His transcending transmission includes all the rich dispensing of the Triune God (vv. 3-14):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Such an all-inclusive transmission brings us into union not only with the incarnated, crucified Christ but also with the resurrected, transcending Christ; in union with this transcending Christ, we have surpassed all the negative things and transcended above them all&mdash;vv. 21-23.</li>
	<li>The transmitting of the transcending Christ is to transfuse into the church, the Body of Christ, what the Triune God has accomplished, attained, and obtained for the heading up of all things in Christ&mdash;vv. 10, 19, 22-23.</li>
	<li>The transcending Christ&rsquo;s transmission also brings us into Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry in His twelve statuses, which He has attained and obtained in His ascension, as the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&mdash;Phil. 1:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord of all&mdash;Acts 2:36a.</li>
		<li>The Christ of God&mdash;v. 36b.</li>
		<li>The Leader of all the rulers&mdash;5:31a.</li>
		<li>The Savior&mdash;v. 31b.</li>
		<li>The High Priest&mdash;Heb. 4:14-15; 7:26.</li>
		<li>The Advocate&mdash;1 John 2:1b.</li>
		<li>The Intercessor&mdash;Heb. 7:25.</li>
		<li>The Mediator of the new covenant&mdash;8:6.</li>
		<li>The surety of the new covenant&mdash;7:22.</li>
		<li>The Life-giver&mdash;John 10:10b.</li>
		<li>The Comforter&mdash;14:16-17.</li>
		<li>The Lamb-God&mdash;Rev. 22:1b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His heavenly ministry in ascension, Christ is serving us by dispensing Himself as the reality of the New Testament jubilee into us for our enjoyment&mdash;Heb. 8:2; Luke 4:18-22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ served us in the past, still serves us in the present, and is going to serve us in the future&mdash;Mark 10:45; Luke 22:26-27; 12:37; cf. 9:54-56; 19:10.</li>
	<li>In His heavenly ministry in ascension, Christ as the life-giving Spirit is serving us by dispensing Himself into us for our experience and enjoyment as revealed in the Gospel of Luke in the following aspects:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He is the rising sun from on high, to shine upon those sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace&mdash;1:78-79.</li>
		<li>He is the Savior of fallen mankind for God&rsquo;s good pleasure&mdash;2:8-14.</li>
		<li>He is a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of God&rsquo;s people Israel&mdash;v. 32.</li>
		<li>He likens Himself to a moneylender, who forgives all His debtors graciously to receive love from them&mdash;7:41-42, 50.</li>
		<li>He portrays Himself as the good Samaritan, taking care of the fallen and law-stricken sinner with compassion, healing him with the Spirit and the divine life, and putting him into the church&mdash;10:25-37.</li>
		<li>He is a Sheep-finder, coming to the wilderness of the world to find the lost sheep and bring it back&mdash;15:3-32.</li>
		<li>He is the best robe of righteousness, prepared by God for the returned sinners to be justified by God&mdash;v. 22; Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30.</li>
		<li>He is the fattened calf, the portion of the life supply prepared by God for the believing sinners to be satisfied inwardly&mdash;Luke 15:23; 1 Cor. 1:9.</li>
		<li>He is the kingdom of God as a seed sown into the believers to develop into God&rsquo;s kingdom; such a kingdom is within the believers in the church&mdash;Luke 17:20-24; Mark 4:3, 14, 26; 1 John 3:9; Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>He is the One prophesied in the Old Testament for the believers to receive through repentance for forgiveness of sins in His death and resurrection; the entire Old Testament is a revelation of Christ, and He is its center and content&mdash;Luke 24:27, 44-47.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To live in ascension is to live continually in our spirit and discern our spirit from our soul; when we live in our spirit, we are joined to the ascended Christ in the heavens&mdash;Eph. 2:22; Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51; Rev. 4:1-2; Heb. 4:12.</li>
	<li>We must learn to hide ourselves in the secret place of the Most High, to hide ourselves in the ascended Christ, taking Him as our dwelling place&mdash;Psa. 91:1; 90:1-11; John 16:33.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His heavenly ministry in ascension, Christ as the life-giving Spirit is transforming us with the riches of the Triune God so that we may become a &ldquo;palanquin,&rdquo; the moving vessel of Christ, the carriage of Christ, the &ldquo;car&rdquo; of Christ, for the move of Christ in and for the Body of Christ&mdash;S. S. 3:9-10; cf. 2 Cor. 2:12-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We are rebuilt with the Divine Trinity so that our external structure is the resurrected and ascended humanity of Jesus, and our interior decoration is our love for the Lord.</li>
	<li>It is Christ as our King Solomon who makes us a palanquin for Himself; our responsibility is simply to offer our love to Him and offer ourselves willingly to Him&mdash;John 21:15-17; Psa. 110:3.</li>
	<li>Our inner being should be &ldquo;inlaid with love&rdquo;; loving the Lord will keep us in the realm of having Christ as our humanity, safeguarding our humanity in the constraint of His affection&mdash;S. S. 3:10; 2 Cor. 5:14.</li>
	<li>Through our loving the Lord in a personal, affectionate, private, and spiritual way, our natural being is torn down, and we are remodeled with Christ&rsquo;s redeeming death (its posts made of silver), God&rsquo;s divine nature (its base of gold), and Christ&rsquo;s kingship as the life-giving Spirit ruling within us (its seat of purple)&mdash;cf. Rom. 8:28-29; 2 Cor. 4:16-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His heavenly ministry in ascension, Christ is functioning as our great High Priest&mdash;Heb. 7:25-26; 8:1-2; cf. Acts 6:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He is cherishing and nourishing the churches to care for them:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He takes care of the churches as the lampstands in His humanity as the Son of Man to cherish them by trimming the wicks and adding more oil&mdash;Rev. 1:13; Exo. 25:38; 30:7; cf. Zech 4:12-14.</li>
		<li>He takes care of the churches as the lampstands in His divinity with His divine love, signified by the golden girdle on His breasts, to nourish the churches with His divine and mystical ministry of three stages&mdash;incarnation, inclusion, and intensification&mdash;Rev. 1:13; John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 4:5; 5:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Just as the high priest in the Old Testament bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his shoulders and on his heart, Christ as our High Priest is bearing us on His shoulders (His strength) and holding us on His heart (His love)&mdash;Exo. 28:9-10, 12, 21, 29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He is &ldquo;a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God&rdquo; (Heb. 2:17), a High Priest who is able to sympathize with us in our weaknesses (4:15).</li>
		<li>Although Christ as the High Priest is taking care of us, we all have our own thought and feeling as to how He should care for us; many times we do not know what is best for us or what the reason is for certain things; only the Lord as the High Priest knows the reason, and His care for us is always positive&mdash;Rom. 8:28-29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Ultimately, Christ as the High Priest is caring for God&rsquo;s need and interests:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God will listen to our prayer when our prayer to God is toward Christ, the kingdom of God, and the house of God as the goal in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1 Kings 8:48; Dan. 6:10.</li>
		<li>No matter for whom we are praying, our prayers should be aimed at the interests of God, that is, at Christ and the church as God&rsquo;s interests on earth, for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Eph. 5:32; 6:17-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry as the High Priest in ascension consummates in the New Jerusalem, which will be the mingling of divinity with humanity to be the very expansion, enlargement, increase, and expression of the Triune God in humanity forever as the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 9-11.</li>
