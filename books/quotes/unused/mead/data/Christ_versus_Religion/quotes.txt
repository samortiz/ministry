[1]  CONTENTS Christ the Bridegroom Four New Things The Way to Rest Revelation, Vision, and Application What Think Ye of Christ?
[2]  The Presence of the Resurrected One Christ, the Life-imparting One Christ Giving Sight The Lord's Commission Christ Versus Religion in the Book of Acts Christ Versus Religion in the Epistles Five Steps Toward a New Religion The Age of the Book of Revelation The Leaven and the Harlot PREFACE
[3]  From the record of Matthew we see that all things related to Christ took place outside of religion.
[4]  Matthew chapter 3 relates to us the principle of the introducing of Christ this also is absolutely outside of religion.
[5]  Skipping over Matthew chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8, we come to chapter 9, where something very interesting occurred vv.
[6]  Could you believe that after such a short time the disciples of John the Baptist, who had nothing to do with religion, could fall into a kind of religion?
[7]  The disciples of John came to Jesus and spoke to Him in such a way because they saw something they saw Jesus sitting at a feast, not just an ordinary meal, but a feast Luke 5:29 .
[8]  Have you ever had the concept that your Lord Jesus Christ is not only the most Holy God, the Creator, the Almighty Lord, and the Master, but He is your Bridegroom, the most pleasant person?
[9]  The Lord Jesus is so much to us: He is the very God, He is the Creator, He is the Lord, He is the Master, He is the Lamb who bears away our sins and accomplishes redemption in a full way, and He is also the One with the Dove who imparts life into us and baptizes us with the Spirit.
[10]  Secondly, we are the guests invited by God to the wedding feast of His Son Matt 22:1-10; Rev 19:9 .
[11]  CHAPTER TWO FOUR NEW THINGS Scripture Reading: Matt 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39
[12]  We have seen how Christ presented Himself to the people as the Bridegroom.
[13]  You remember that in Matthew chapter 1 we are told that Christ was called Emmanuel, which means God with us.
[14]  Here we have four things, and with each of them the single, unchanging word "new" is used.
[15]  If I were the prodigal son, after putting on the best robe, I would be a bit concerned.
[16]  I may say, "O father, the best robe satisfies you, but it does not satisfy me; I am still hungry.
[17]  We have spoken of three of the new items, but we have not indicated much concerning the new cloth.
[18]  There is a marvelous verse in the New Testament, with words to which I am afraid you have paid little attention.
[19]  "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit."
[20]  It says firstly that we were all baptized in the Holy Spirit, and secondly that we were all made to drink of the one Spirit.
[21]  Christ is our righteousness, Christ is our covering, Christ is our qualification, Christ is our new garment.
[22]  I am standing before You, not in myself, but in Christ not in Christ as a doctrine, but in Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit."
[23]  Now we must see more concerning Christ as the new wineskin.
[24]  Let us read I Corinthians 12:12, "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ."
[25]  We read in this verse not only that the members composed together are the one Body, but that this Body is Christ.
[26]  We always consider Christ as the Head; we have considered little, if at all, that Christ is also the Body.
[27]  Christ is in you, Christ is in me, Christ is in him, and Christ is in every one of us we all have Christ within.
[28]  Without the church you may enjoy Christ here a little and there a little, but you can never enjoy Christ in a full way, neither can you enjoy Him constantly.
[29]  Most all of us come from a background of Christianity, where we learned that Christians need to have certain kinds of Christian meetings called services.
[30]  I do not mean which is right or wrong I do not care for this, and I do not believe the Lord Jesus would care for this either.
[31]  Out of these four new things, four kinds of so-called Christians have come into existence.
[32]  They only take Christ as the new cloth: they do not believe in the Lord's crucifixion or the Lord's redemption, but only appreciate the Lord while He was on this earth.
[33]  They believe that Christ is God, that Christ is our Redeemer, that Christ died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected.
[34]  We have Christ as our righteousness, we have Christ as our life, and we have Christ in a corporate way as our church life.
[35]  CHAPTER THREE THE WAY TO REST Scripture Reading: Matt 11:18-19, 25-30; 12:1-14, 38-42
[36]  It was "at that time," after speaking in this way, that Jesus went with His disciples on the sabbath day through the cornfields.
[37]  He said in effect, "You are so fundamental, you are so scriptural, have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him; how he entered into the house of God and ate the shewbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests?
[38]  The Lord Jesus said, "I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here" v. 6 . The Lord Jesus was saying in effect to the Pharisees, "My disciples were eating in the Temple.
[39]  If you are outside Christ, you are under bondage, but if you are in Christ, you are free.
[40]  The religious people then took the opportunity to trouble the Lord Jesus again by asking, "Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?" v. 10 . Here was a case of a man with a withered hand not a case of a whole man, but a case of a member of the body, a hand.
[41]  They do not care if you are withered or alive as long as you keep the regulations.
[42]  Today is the age of the living Christ and the living members; not the Christ in teachings and doctrines, but the Christ in life, the Christ as the life-giving Spirit.
[43]  Now in chapter 12 again another religious matter is presented to the Lord Jesus.
[44]  We are not saying that we do not need all the previous items.
[45]  In the church life we have justification by faith, in the church life we have sanctification by faith, in the church life we also have the other items of the Lord's recovery, including the Pentecostal experience.
[46]  He said, in other words, "Just come to Me; I am your David who can afford you full satisfaction, I am the greater Temple in which you may be free from all kinds of bondage and regulations, I am the Lord of the sabbath who can give you rest and who is your rest, I am the greater Jonah that affords you something of the resurrection, and I am the greater Solomon, continually accomplishing God's economy in you, through you, and among you."
[47]  CHAPTER FOUR REVELATION, VISION, AND APPLICATION Scripture Reading: Matt 16:13-19, 17:1-9, 24-27
[48]  For a considerable number of years we have been abiding mostly in the Epistles in Ephesians, Romans, and all the other letters written mostly by the Apostle Paul.
[49]  In the first portion of Matthew 16 we read, "Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi..." v. 13 . If you look at the map, you will see that Caesarea Philippi was far to the north, even north of Galilee.
[50]  Peter had seen the revelation of Christ, and the Lord Jesus appraised him well.
[51]  But in the following verse, the Lord Jesus said, "And I also say unto thee..." v. 18 . Peter had just received the first fifty percent of the revelation.
[52]  In using this word the Lord Jesus, in effect, was saying unto Peter, "What you have seen is absolutely correct, but it is just fifty percent, just the first half; you still need the second half."
[53]  In other words, the Lord Jesus was saying to Peter, "It is wonderful that you have seen Christ, but you must see something more.
[54]  Many times while we are in a vision, however, some wonderful person breaks in. I cannot explain why, but I know the fact well.
[55]  When Jesus was transfigured, while Peter, James and John were beholding Him, two wonderful persons entered upon the scene Moses and Elijah.
[56]  God is sovereign: He can send some very wonderful persons like Moses and Elijah, and He can also send some troublesome people.
[57]  Our speech is always so stupid, but the Lord Jesus always speaks in a very simple and pleasing tone.
[58]  When Peter said yes, the Lord Jesus found a way to convince him that it should have been no. However, after Peter was convinced that he should have said no, Jesus said unto him, "But..." v. 27 . You can never beat the Lord Jesus in speaking.
[59]  In any case, by the Lord's talk with him, Peter was convinced and his mouth was shut.
[60]  I do believe that Peter finally learned that he should never open his quick mouth and say yes or no, but let Jesus do the speaking.
[61]  We have seen that when Moses and Elijah appeared with the Lord on the mount, God, speaking from heaven, obviated them.
[62]  The high priest, the authority of the religion, and the elders, the authority of the community, combined together to raise the first question, a question concerning the source of Jesus' authority.
[63]  Then the Pharisees realized it was not so easy to defeat such a One; so they asked the Herodians to join them.
[64]  Then the Pharisees, when they heard that the Sadducees were put to silence, attempted again to examine Jesus.
[65]  But the Lord Jesus not only asked a question.
[66]  He went on to quote Psalm 110, verse 1, where God is recorded as saying to Christ, "Sit thou on my right hand, till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet."
[67]  The ascension of the Lord Jesus is the climax of all that He is, of all that He has done, and of all that He will do.
[68]  Thank the Lord that in these recent years so many have been rescued and delivered to a certain extent from religion.
[69]  Yet we still have a certain amount of religion within us.
[70]  By all these verses we may see that the Lord Jesus has nothing in His mind and heart but Himself and His church.
[71]  We have been greatly distracted from Christ and the church by so many religious things, political things, matters concerning the sound faith and how to interpret the Bible.
[72]  We have seen that the Book of Matthew is clearly a book concerning Christ versus religion.
[73]  The angels then told the women, "Go quickly, and tell his disciples, he is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him" 28:7 .
[74]  But I do believe the Lord Jesus did this deliberately and intention ally to impress His disciples that this was a new start, that this new age has nothing to do with the old religion.
[75]  Jesus said to the women, "Go tell my brethren" v. 10 . This is a new term "my brethren." Religious people always consider that we are at most the servants of the Lord, or to use a more intimate term, the children of the Lord.
[76]  I fear that if you go into any kind of Christian service today and praise the Lord Jesus in this way, you will be promptly quenched and charged with irreverence.
[77]  Concerning the work of the Lord He said simply, "Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
[78]  We must be practical in applying this to our present situation.
[79]  In this Book of Matthew, a book concerning Christ versus religion, it is indeed impressive and meaningful that the ascension of Jesus is never mentioned.
[80]  There is not one verse or word in this book telling us that He ascended to the heavens.
[81]  CHAPTER SEVEN CHRIST, THE LIFE-IMPARTING ONE Scripture Reading: John 5:1-18, 21, 24-26, 39-40, 46-47; 6:63
[82]  We have been in the first book of the four Gospels, Matthew, and now we come to the last, John.
[83]  The record of all four Gospels from the beginning to the end shows how Christ is versus religion and religion is always against Christ.
[84]  We have seen three main points in the Gospel of Matthew: firstly, that Jesus is our Bridegroom for our present enjoyment; secondly, that Jesus is the way where-by we may find rest; and thirdly, that Jesus is our Lawgiver and Prophet, He is today's Moses and our present Elijah.
[85]  But listen, suddenly a man came not a big man, but the little Jesus.
[86]  "When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, He saith unto him, wouldst thou be made whole?" v. 6 . Now listen to the foolish religious talk: "Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me." While he was speaking nonsense, the Lord Jesus commanded, "Arise, take up thy bed, and walk." What does this mean? This simply means, "Forget about that religious nonsense.
[87]  Then Jesus went on to say, "As the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom He will" v. 21 . What is this? This is Christ versus religion.
[88]  We must all realize today it is not a matter of religion, but of Christ as the very God imparting life to us.
[89]  We need a Christ who is equal to God and who is God Himself, imparting life to us.
[90]  "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my Word, and believeth Him that sent Me. hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life" v. 24 . Whoever hears His living Word and receives it has eternal life.
[91]  If you have Christ with the Scriptures, surely you will have life; but if you have the Scriptures. but are devoid of the living Christ as the life-giving Spirit, you have no life.
[92]  We have seen firstly that Christ is our happiness, secondly that He is our rest, thirdly that He is our Lawgiver and Predictor, and fourthly that He is the One who imparts life to us.
[93]  What is the organ for us to use these two keys?
[94]  Whenever we pray, we must pray in our spirit; whenever we pray-read the Word, we must pray-read with our spirit; whenever we say, "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah," we must say it by exercising our human spirit.
[95]  We all must realize firstly that we have such a Christ a Christ for our happiness, a Christ for our rest, a Christ as our Lawgiver and Predictor, and a Christ as the Life-giver.
[96]  CHAPTER EIGHT CHRIST GIVING SIGHT Scripture Reading: John 9:1-3, 6-7, 14-16, 22, 24-25, 28-30, 33-38; 10:1-11, 14-16, 21, 26-31, 38-39
[97]  Now we come to chapter 9 of John, where we find another sabbath.
[98]  In all of them the Lord Jesus did something to break them.
[99]  Now we come to the last sabbath, the fourth case.
[100]  And the Lord Jesus clearly implies in the following chapter of John, chapter 10, that this very man was one who was in the "fold."
[101]  Let us now consider the case of the blind man in more detail.
[102]  The Lord Jesus passing by saw this man blind from his birth.
[103]  But Jesus answered, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents" v. 3 . If you read the Gospel of John carefully, you will see that people frequently came to Jesus with questions requiring a yes or no answer.
[104]  She said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain: and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship" v. 20 . But the Lord Jesus replied, "Neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father" v. 21 . The Lord's answer to His disciples in chapter 9 was of a similar nature.
[105]  The Lord Jesus told His disciples, "Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him" v. 3 . The question of the disciples was one of religion; the answer of the Lord Jesus was one of revelation.
[106]  Reviling him, they said, "Thou art His disciple; but we are disciples of Moses" v. 28 . They called Jesus a sinner because He broke the sabbath, but the blind man exclaimed, "Whether He is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see" v. 25 . The blind man didn't care about right or wrong; he only cared that he received his sight.
[107]  But the Lord Jesus met him and asked, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" v. 35 . He answered and said, "And who is He, Lord, that I may believe on Him?" Jesus replied, "Thou hast both seen Him, and He it is that speaketh with thee." And he said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshipped Him.
[108]  Before He came, Jesus was the door by which they all came in. Then when he came, He said in effect, "Now I am the door for you all to get out." In the Old Testament time Christ was the door for the saints to enter the fold, and now in the New Testament time He is the door for all the sheep who are in the fold to come out.
[109]  Today we are no more in the pit, no more in the religious porches, no more in the fold, but on the pasture which is Christ Himself.
[110]  Chapter 10 of the Gospel of John must be put together with chapter 9: these are not two separate records, but one record in two chapters.
[111]  In chapter 10 the Lord Jesus said, "The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly" v. 10 . Many times we have quoted this verse in an isolated way, neglecting the context.
[112]  When we come to chapter 20 of this Gospel, we see how the Lord Jesus after His resurrection came to His disciples and breathed into them.
[113]  CHAPTER NINE THE LORD'S COMMISSION Scripture Reading: John 20:1, 11, 14-17, 19-23, 26; 21:1, 3-6, 9-19, 22
[114]  Among the four Gospels there are two which indicate how greatly Christ is versus religion Matthew and John.
[115]  Let us look at the last two verses of chapter 20, verses 30 and 31: "Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book: but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in His name."
[116]  If you were Jesus and realized that you were going to die and be raised from the dead, surely you would have made many arrangements with your disciples.
[117]  You would have said, "Peter, John, James, and the rest of you, come here and let me give you a schedule.
[118]  Firstly I am going to die; secondly, I will be raised from the dead on the third day; thirdly, you must all meet me at a certain place, where I will do certain things among you; fourthly, you must all go to other places, where certain other things will happen; fifthly, sixthly, etc., etc., to number twenty-four."
[119]  But, praise the Lord, though they had no schedule, no arrangements, no appointments, they had the resurrected Christ, the living Lord Jesus.
[120]  "Go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God" 20:17 .
[121]  Following chapter 20, we have a "P.S.," an appendix, showing us that those disciples were more or less like us.
[122]  I do believe many young ones are burning to serve the Lord with their full time.
[123]  Some have been hindered from doing so by the thought of the difficulty they will have in obtaining a living.
[124]  But let me tell you that whenever we think anything about the matter of making a living, we are religious.
[125]  With the living Jesus, with the resurrected Christ, there is no problem of making a living.
[126]  After the disciples dined on the meal Jesus prepared, the Lord said to Peter, "Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these?" v. 15 . In effect, the Lord was saying to Peter, "A few days ago you said that though all others should deny me, you would not.
[127]  But you did, and you did it three times; so I must ask you three times also, 'Do you love Me more than all the others?'
[128]  At the end of both Matthew and John we see a further matter which is quite significant.
[129]  At the end of Matthew, Jesus met with His disciples in a place appointed by Him, a mountain top.
[130]  This is why the Lord Jesus, on the mountain appointed by Him, told His disciples that all authority both in heaven and on earth has been given unto Him.
[131]  We all need to be beside ourselves with this so much so that we can go into the streets and lay hold of people, telling them, "Friends, you must realize that Jesus is with me, the resurrected Christ is with me, the Christ who holds all authority both in heaven and on earth."
[132]  But after Matthew 28, we come to John 21.
[133]  I must confess that I like John 21 much better than Matthew 28, because according to my experience I am not always so high.
[134]  We have seen how the Lord selected Peter and questioned him three times concerning his love.
[135]  The Lord said in effect, "You go fishing more than all the rest do you love me more than all the rest?"
[136]  And then He spoke to him with this implication, "Just as I have fed you here with fish and bread, so you must feed My lambs and My sheep.
[137]  We all must realize that in the Book of Acts Christ is living with all His members.
[138]  In the Gospels we have Christ in the body given Him by Mary, His physical body; but in the Acts we have Christ in a larger Body, a mystical Body, given Him by the Holy Spirit.
[139]  This time Peter remembered well the lesson he learned with such difficulty in Matthew 17.
[140]  You remember how the Lord Jesus brought James and John together with Peter to the mount of transfiguration, but Peter did not consult with them; Peter did not care for them.
[141]  Following chapters 10 and 11, we come to chapter 15, where we read that certain men went down to Antioch from Jerusalem telling the people, "Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved" v. 1 . Listen to the religion.
[142]  Let me warn you again of thinking that you are through with religion.
[143]  I tell you, you may be through with religion, but religion will not be through with you.
[144]  Today, in principle, we are in the same situation.
[145]  Christ is only Christ Himself, and Christ cares only for Himself; He does not care for a Christ in doctrine, a Christ in history, or the Christ in your mind.
[146]  In the first chapter of the letter to the Galatians, Paul gives a little history of his background in religion.
[147]  We must be here not caring for anything but Christ and the church.
[148]  We may have all things: we may have pray-reading, we may have speaking in tongues, we may have head covering, we may have bare feet, we may have all other things that are not sinful.
[149]  You may say that you do not like bare feet, but the Lord may say that He isn't concerned about that.
[150]  But be careful: this term "liberal Christian" refers to the modernists who do not believe that the Bible is the divine revelation, nor that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who accomplished redemption, was resurrected, and ascended to the heavens.
[151]  Let us look now at the passage in Ephesians 4: "That we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; but holding the reality in love, may grow up in all things into Him, who is the head, even Christ" vv.
[152]  Suppose that three brothers, born of the same parents, attend a Gospel meeting and all are saved.
[153]  That means they have all received the same faith.
[154]  In his letter to the Philippians Paul elaborates more on his religious background.
[155]  He had high attainments in religion; yet what things were gain to him in religion, those he counted loss for Christ.
[156]  CHAPTER TWELVE FIVE STEPS TOWARD A NEW RELIGION Scripture Reading: Rev 1:12-18; 2:1-7, 12-21, 24-29; 3:1-6, 14-22; 17:4-5; 18:2, 4; 19:7-8
[157]  Now we come to the Book of Revelation, where we also see many things concerning Christ versus religion.
[158]  We must all realize that the Christ in this book differs distinctly from the Christ in the four Gospels.
[159]  In the Gospels we see a Christ who is gentle, tender, and mild; but in the Revelation we see a Christ whom we may describe as fierce.
[160]  The Lord warned the church in Ephesus, "Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent...or else I come to thee, and will move thy lampstand out of its place" 2:5 .
[161]  The Lord said that if they would not repent and return to their first love, they would lose their light, they would lose the testimony, they would lose the lampstand and be in darkness.
[162]  In other words, without the first and best love, they would be finished as far as the testimony of the Lord Jesus was concerned.
[163]  Abundance of labor for the Lord Jesus does not prove that we have the testimony.
[164]  We must learn not to imitate Jesus, not merely to follow Jesus, but to eat Jesus as the tree of life in the church as the paradise of God.
[165]  I have full assurance in my spirit to encourage all the Lord's children to pray and even to shout in the meetings.
[166]  I do believe that this is the Lord's reaction today.
[167]  The Lord Jesus is reacting today against religion and culture.
[168]  In the history of the Lord's move, following the recovery five hundred years ago through Martin Luther, another step was taken by the Lord about one hundred and forty years ago through the so-called Brethren.
[169]  The Lord promised that if we are on the alert to avoid all kinds of religion, we will be kept continually in the enjoyment of the Lord, we will be given to eat of Him as the tree of life, as the hidden manna, and we will sup with Him and He with us.
[170]  In chapter 18 we hear the Lord's call, "Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins" v. 4 . And in chapter 19 we have the word, "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready" v. 7 . Praise the Lord that we may be in the local church life today, fully separated from anything religious, and thus prepared as the Bride of the Lamb.
[171]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE AGE OF THE BOOK OF REVELATION Scripture Reading: Rev 2:1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 29; 3:1a, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22; 14:13b; 22:17a; 5:6; 1:10; 19:10b; 22:6b NO QUOTATIONS
[172]  The age of the Book of Revelation is the age of the seven Spirits, and this is the day in which we are living.
[173]  5:1 , etc. Here in the Book of Revelation it never says, "Thus saith the Lord," or "This I say," etc. It says rather, "The Spirit saith, the Spirit saith, the Spirit saith." Have you noticed this same sentence with the same wording repeated seven times: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches"? Why is this sentence repeated seven times? Because of the seven-fold Spirit.
[174]  Neither can we find in the Book of Revelation any doctrines, gifts, or even any gifted persons.
[175]  Anything without the presence of Christ is just a religion to us.
[176]  We must all see the character of today's age.
[177]  Never think that the Book of Revelation is merely a book of prophecy.
[178]  We have read Revelation 19:10 saying that "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
[179]  I agree that Revelation is a book of prophecy, but you must not merely care for the prophecy and forget the Spirit.
[180]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE LEAVEN AND THE HARLOT Scripture Reading: Matt 13:33, 45, 46; Rev 17:3-5; 19:7, 8; 21:10, 11, 18, 19a; 22:1; 21:6; 22:17 LEAVEN HID IN THE MEAL
[181]  In the New Testament, from the first book to the last, there are always two main things revealed.
[182]  Now we must see the second matter, the other side.
[183]  In the same chapter, Matthew 13, we see the Lord as a merchant willing to pay any price for a certain article.
[184]  But on the other side, in Revelation chapters 19 and 21, we have another woman, the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.
[185]  In the great Babylon there is gold, precious stone and pearl, but there is no flow of the living water.
[186]  If you are in a place where you sense there is no river, no flowing, but on the contrary a dry and barren land, you must be clear that you are either in the great harlot or in one of her little daughters.
