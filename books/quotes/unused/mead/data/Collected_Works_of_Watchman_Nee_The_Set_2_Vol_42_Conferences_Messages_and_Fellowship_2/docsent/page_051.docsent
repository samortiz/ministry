   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST Date: October 20, 1936, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kulangsu</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Rom 6:11; 1 Pet 1:3; John 12:24, 33; Gal 3:28</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the past three evenings, we have seen the matter of being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Last night we saw one thing that is accomplished in Christ death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ has died on the cross, and those who are in Christ have also died.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not have to die ourselves; there is no need for us to seek to die or to think of ways to die.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Christ we are all dead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the death of Christ, those who are in Him are dead already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have a brother who was an officer in the army.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He told me that if anyone retreated during a battle and ran away from the army, he would be executed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He talked about this with the other officers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The military law was stricter than any civil law, and many soldiers could not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The officers were cruel and constantly harassing them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet once a soldier dies, he is free from the authority of the officers, and the officers can no longer do anything to him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An officer can abuse a soldier only to the point of death, after which the officer can do nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The same principle is involved with our being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Adam's sin dominates us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through sin Satan often harasses and overpowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But once we die in Christ, we are free from its domination.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is God's way of dealing with our problems on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But what has He done for us on the positive side?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has appointed Adam to be the head of the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After Adam fell, everyone became a sinner by birth, because everyone is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can God deliver us out of sin?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His way of salvation is to appoint a new Head Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the Head of the new human race, just as Adam was the head of the old human race.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We become persons in Christ, just as we were persons in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man is never independent; either he is in Adam or in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he is not in Christ, he is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is only one man in heaven, and there is only one man in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As we are sitting here today, we should ask ourselves whether we are in Adam or in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must realize that we leave Adam and enter into Christ through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The resurrection of Christ is the beginning of everything in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is interesting to note that the Bible never tells us to believe in the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It only tells us to believe in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1 Corinthians 15:14, Paul said, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is vain; your faith is vain also."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The death of Christ takes care of the negative things; it terminates everything in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The resurrection of Christ is positive; through resurrection we receive a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are delivered from sin and enabled to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Christ resurrected, those who died in Him were also resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They became a new man in God's eyes through the new life they received.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>REGENERATED THROUGH</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Peter 1:3 mentions a very wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many people in the church today talk about regeneration, but they do not understand how regeneration occurs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many say that we have been regenerated through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But Peter said that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have been regenerated through Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In other words, if Christ had not resurrected, we would not have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Christ died and resurrected, we died and resurrected with Him as well Eph 2:6 , and we received His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regeneration brings us the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This life was imparted to us at the time of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He first had to die before He could resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If He had not died, He could not have resurrected and would not have been able to impart His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord that He has died and lived again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, He can dispense His life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to consider Christ's death and resurrection before we can understand the overcoming life that we have received in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the Lord was on earth, He spoke of the parable of the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is recorded in John 12:24.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord said that if a grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it abides alone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if it dies, it bears many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 33 shows clearly that the death of the grain of wheat, as mentioned by the Lord, refers to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A grain of wheat is different from a grain of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A grain of wheat has life, whereas sand does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if the grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it will remain as grain even after millions of years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord Jesus as the grain of wheat fell into Bethlehem and died at Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then He resurrected, and in resurrection He regenerated us, giving us the same life as His.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If Christ had not left heaven to come to earth, there would only be one person, Himself, today.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible says that Christ is God's only begotten Son 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means that He is the unique Son.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God loves His only begotten Son, but He wants to have many sons Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He desires to see His only begotten Son become the firstborn Son so that He can have many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Gospel of John, Christ is God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But in Romans 8 and Hebrews 2, He has become God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We cannot call a person a firstborn son and an only begotten son at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Being a firstborn son means that there are other sons to follow, but being the only begotten son means that there are no more sons.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Yet God wants His only begotten Son to become the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How can Christ as the only begotten Son of God become God's firstborn Son?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If the only begotten Son remained in heaven all the time, there would forever be an only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In order for Him to become the firstborn Son, there is a need for Him to "fall" from heaven to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One day Christ "fell" from heaven to Bethlehem and later died.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There are two aspects to His death: the first is the redemptive aspect, which is for the purpose of taking away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The second is the non-redemptive aspect, which is for the purpose of releasing His life.</S>
