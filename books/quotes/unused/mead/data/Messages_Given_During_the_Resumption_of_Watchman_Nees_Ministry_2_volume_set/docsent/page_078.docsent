   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING MIGRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: What is God doing in China today?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What should be our emphasis?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What are the steps we have to take?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that these matters are not so clear to us yet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Lee answered: In the past, we have laid quite a foundation for our work already.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the way to go on is indeed a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, let us consider the question of migration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's People Being Sojourners on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's spiritual people are a group of people who are constantly on the move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was the way with the Israelites in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were not settled in a fixed place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, they moved around.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are a people who are called by a heavenly calling Heb 3:1, 9 ; we do not belong to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, God has called us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are but sojourners on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible says that we are the heavenly citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our commonwealth exists in the heavens Phil 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Old Testament, Abraham was called to leave Ur of Chaldea to go to the place that God had prepared for him and to serve Him there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He moved from one place to another, and he was a sojourner on earth Heb 11:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A sojourner is a person whose heart is always on the move; he has no heart to settle down.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is like the co-workers who travel and work in various places; everywhere they go, they may be served with good food, comfortable lodging, and warm hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet after they stay in a place for a while, they have to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is how Christians should be they should be like the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Calling, the Beginning,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>and the Revival of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word "church" is ekklesia in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It should be translated "assembly."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The "assembly" is a group of people who have received a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are but sojourners on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the beginning, both the apostles and the saints as well were moving people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Acts, the scattered saints went everywhere to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only were the co-workers moving; the saints were also moving Acts 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way of the gospel is composed of the going out of the apostles and the going out of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before Acts 13, there was the going out of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Acts 13, there was the going out of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later, both lines ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Two hundred years ago, there was the great Moravian revival in Bohemia.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a result of that revival, many people went out from that place to North America, the Pacific regions, and the Atlantic regions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This move was lost when the church became degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the church is revived, the gospel goes out, and many workers go out also.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Christian Way Being to "Go"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, however, how many saints are going?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What God wants us to do is something that has not been done before, and that is migration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For people to move because of the war is something they did against their will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>During our war with the Japanese, many people moved to Kunming, but after the Japanese were defeated, these people moved back to their original places.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This should not be the case with those who are moving for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible shows us that we "come" to receive grace, and we "go" to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Bible, there are many "comings."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of us should circle these "comings" with a red pen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the Bible also speaks of "going."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The last chapter of Matthew speaks of "going."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first chapter of Acts also speaks of "going."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By Acts 28, the "going" had only gone as far as Rome; it was not completed yet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Acts is an unfinished book.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In heaven, there may be two hundred chapters to Acts by now.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The gospel went from Rome to Europe, then across the Pacific, and finally to the east coast of China.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although the gospel has come to the East, it was difficult for the Westerners to spread the gospel to the interior of China.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Chinese do not like to move, and hence the gospel stopped at the east coast of China.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the case with the church and the saints today.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Man likes to settle in a place.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some families have been living here in Swatow for over a century.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Their living revolves around this place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Their children are born here, they die here, and they are buried here.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everything is set.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that some would go to Tibet for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we "come," we drop the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we "go," we take up heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the way of the Christian.</S>
