   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORD BECOMING FLESH AND TABERNACLING AMONG US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 1:1 and 2 say, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was in the beginning with God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning, that is, in eternity past, the Word that defined God, explained God, and revealed God, was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was with God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then one day He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 1:14, the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The translation "was made" in the King James Version is not correct.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The proper rendering of the Greek word is "became."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Greek word here indicates a strong step related to having a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In eternity Christ, the living Word, was God without humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But through incarnation He took a strong step to have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 1:14 says that the Word not only became flesh but also tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this verse there are two predicates: became and tabernacled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The story recorded in the four Gospels is a story of God incarnate tabernacling among us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "tabernacling" covers the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>CHRIST CRUCIFIED AS THE LAMB OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Toward the end of the record in the Gospels, the Lord Jesus went to the cross to die for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He died as the Lamb of God John 1:29, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, in the four Gospels we see Christ as the tabernacle, and at the end of the Gospels we see Him crucified as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE HEAVENLY DOVE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After accomplishing redemption as the Lamb, Christ was resurrected and came as the Dove, as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Dove is actually Christ Himself in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse points to another new beginning, also indicated by the word "became."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Word became flesh, that was a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When in resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit, that was another new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now Christ is with us as the Dove.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 20 and 21 we see Him as the Dove.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE DOVE-LAMB</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Acts and in the Epistles we have the record of the heavenly Dove, the Dove out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the Lamb Christ walked upon the earth, but as the Dove He soars in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This soaring Dove descends upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we lay our hand upon the Lamb, the Dove descends upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now what we have is not the Lamb and the Dove, but the Lamb with the Dove.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Dove does not stand beside the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, the Dove rests upon the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Dove descends upon the Lamb and abides upon the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the Dove and the Lamb are one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Dove-Lamb is a single entity with two parts, the Lamb, the first part, and the Dove, the second part.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As the Lamb He is the Redeemer; as the Dove He is the life-giver.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>LIVING STONES FOR A SPIRITUAL HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Epistles we see the transforming work of the Dove to make us stones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Epistles many stones are produced.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The issue of these stones is the building up of a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As Peter says, we are living stones being built up a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This spiritual house will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this message we have seen a sketch of the whole New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First we have the Word, the living Word with the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we have the tabernacling of the incarnated Word among us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This tabernacling of the Word is described in detail in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the end of the Gospels we see that the Lamb was crucified for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In resurrection the Lamb became the Dove.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the book of Acts and in the Epistles, we see Christ as the Dove.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, in the Epistles we see that the believers are transformed into stones and that all these stones are being built up together to be a spiritual house which consummates in the new Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the central lane of God's operation revealed in the Bible.</S>
