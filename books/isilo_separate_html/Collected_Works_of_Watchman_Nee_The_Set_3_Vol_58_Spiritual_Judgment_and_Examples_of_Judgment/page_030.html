When the outer man no longer supports the inner man or replaces it, our emotion, mind, and will recede to the background one by one. Then God will teach us the lesson of faith. It will be a kind of calm and cool faith, a faith that believes in all spiritual realities. We will believe that God's throne remains in heaven, that there is still authority in the Lord Jesus' name, that God's glory is above everything, that His victory cannot be overturned, that the Lord's resurrection has transcended over all, that Satan has been defeated, etc. On our side, our feelings and thoughts change. On God's side, nothing changes. In this life of faith, we will gradually crawl out of the tomb. One day by faith we will know what is fact and what is feeling. Facts do not need feelings to support them. A fact is a fact; it needs no evidence or testimony to prove it. It is bare fact, void of feeling, and without need of any aid. Then we will be able to believe in the fact and in the reality with a most unaffected faith. We will be able to believe as if we were a wooden image. For example, we believe that God is love. This does not mean that we feel that God is love or that we think that God is love. We believe in the fact that God is love. When we reach this point, we can say that our faith is pure.</p><p>God's children must be led to the point where their faith in God runs contrary to their own thoughts and is on a level that is beyond themselves. Job lost his family and possessions. He was even covered with boils. He could very well have said that God no longer loved him, that He hated him. But he worked his way out of himself. He acted in a way that ran contrary to his own thoughts. He was able to say in 13:15, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (KJV). Job went beyond himself to trust in God. His faith was based on fact, not on experience or feeling. This kind of faith is pure and undefiled. John Bunyan once said, "If God is right, come heaven or hell, I will still trust in Him." It is not a matter of heaven or hell, but our faith in God. Job believed God, and no material thing lent his faith any helping hand. Materially speaking, can we say that God loved Job? His experience consisted of nothing but bankruptcy, the death of his children, and the presence of boils all over his body! What kind of faith is this? This is pure faith. What God wants to do with us through such experiences (in whatever degree they come) is to leave us with nothing but the facts so that we will learn to have a pure faith.</p><p>You say that you want to climb back. This depends on what you mean. If by that you mean you want your outward feelings to come back, there is no such need. We do not need to recover our outward feelings. Of course, if God Himself wants to recover our outward feelings, that is a different matter altogether. Do you want to go up? There is really no such need. It is actually better to go down. We have to learn to live by the facts. What we need is a faith that comes from light; we do not need the many crutches of our feelings. There is no need to worry whether or not our outer man will rise up again. There is a great need for God's servants to live less by outward feelings. All they need is a simple faith that believes in the simple facts.</p><h2 class="head2">Receiving Supply from the Church</h2><p>On the positive side, you have to realize that the church is your supply. If you are by yourself and have closed yourself up, you are on the wrong track. Today we go on by following the footsteps of the flock. We will never go wrong if we serve God in a corporate way. The Christian life has nothing to do with acquiring more doctrines or feelings. When we live in God's light, go along with the supply of the ministry, and give ourselves to these things, our spirit will be strengthened spontaneously.</p><p>In conclusion, there are three things: First, God wants to remove the props of the outer man and to strengthen the inner man. Second, we need a pure life of faith, one that is not mixed with any feelings or thoughts. Third, it is very easy for God to lift up a person's spirit. As long as you go along with all the children of the Lord and receive light and revelation with them in the holy of holies, you spontaneously will be carried forward in God's flow of the age.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
