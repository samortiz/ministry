Consider again the example of the Lord feeding the multitude. He did not charge the disciples to tell the crowd, "Just come and eat." What would they do when the crowd came? Nor did He ask the multitude to come to Him one by one to get their bread. If He had done this, the first one would have taken half a minute and the second would have taken a minute. By the time the last one stood in line, four or five hours would have passed. The Lord's way was to divide the crowd into groups of hundreds and fifties. He gave the bread to the twelve disciples, who in turn passed it on to the groups. This is the meaning of finding the way to manage things.</p><h2 class="head2">Making Assignments and Distributing the Work</h2><p>In managing affairs one has to find the proper way. In dealing with people one has to make proper assignments. We have to distribute the work to the brothers and sisters. We should not allow any one of them to be idle. In distributing the bread, the Lord called all twelve disciples to Him. He gave bread to all twelve. In this way all thirty or fifty groups were taken care of properly. The deacons have to do the same. They have to know how to distribute the work in their hand. They have to know how to assign men to do different tasks. If one does one thing and another does another, the work will be finished in a short time.</p><p>There will be no confusion in the church if we have trial runs, come up with the right way, and make the proper assignments in every situation. The elders have to help the brothers in all the districts do this. Never act rashly. Rash action only brings bad results which do not glorify the Lord. The deacons have to be careful and diligent in their service in the church. The church is the house of God; it is not the laboratory of the saints.</p><p>If we practice all these points, the church will reap the benefit. If we learn our lesson well in the preaching of the gospel, we will become very useful for the migration. Even if we remain in our locality, we will become useful in managing affairs. I sincerely hope that a hundred people will migrate from Hong Kong to Chungking. Chungking is a strategic place for the gospel. The gospel must go out, and we must learn to do things the right way. We must not only know how to do things ourselves, but we must help the brothers and sisters do the same, until their work is as good as God's.</p><p>We all have to exercise and train ourselves this way. This is not a matter of a day's zeal; we have to learn to do this patiently day by day. I hope that the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong will be ahead of those in other places. We have to use every day to the fullest. Every day we have to learn something new and gain something new before God. Our theology is different from others' theology. They learn it in the seminary, outside the church. Our theology is in the church. We are learning to work "in Christ," while they are being perfected in doctrine and procedure only.</p><h2 class="head1">ASSIGNMENT OF WORK FOR THE DEACONS</h2><h2 class="head2">Managing Finances</h2><p>The first time the deacons are spoken of is in Acts 6. There we are told that there was a problem of supply, yet the apostles considered it unfitting for them to forsake the word of God to take care of food. They selected seven men of good reputation, who were filled with the Holy Spirit and wisdom, to manage this matter (vv. 1-6). These seven deacons took care of the distribution of food. The brothers who worked as apostles then devoted themselves to prayer and the ministry of the word. Here we see that deacons are responsible for the business affairs. Management of food means management of finances. It means distributing to each according to his need and making sure that no one is in want. The first work of the deacons in the church is to manage the finances. We ask two brothers to manage the finances, and another two brothers and sisters to do the bookkeeping.</p><p>Managing finances does not mean taking over the finances. The deacons have to work in a proper way under the supervision of the elders. In particular, special designated funds must not be used arbitrarily; the elders must be the ones who make the decisions.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_092.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_094.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 93</div><br></body></html>
