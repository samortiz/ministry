They are not in the air but on earth. They primarily attach themselves to men, pigs, or idols (Matt. 12:43-45; Luke 8:33; 1 Cor. 10:20). They like to lodge themselves in the human body. These demons were probably citizens of the former world. As proof: (1) They are different from the angels (Acts 23:9), (2) they are different from the spirits of the dead people (Job 7:9), and (3) they are spirits that have been separated from their bodies (Matt. 8:16; Luke 10:17, 20; Matt. 17:18; Mark 9:25). They are divided according to the nations of this world, and each one has his own territory, sphere, and boundaries. They are limited by regional boundaries (Luke 8:31).</p><p>Satan's kingdom is tightly organized, and its numerous messengers keep close surveillance on every move of man. This is why we have to cast out demons and withstand their activities when we pray. These demons are the creatures of the former world who became disembodied spirits (their bodies having been destroyed). When they possess man's body:</p><p>(1) Man becomes bent double and cannot stand erect at all (Luke 13:11).</p><p>(2) Man becomes dumb (Matt. 9:33).</p><p>(3) Man is driven to insanity (Matt. 8:28).</p><p>(4) Man worships idols (1 Cor. 10:20-21; Rev. 9:20; 2 Chron. 11:15; Lev. 17:7; Deut. 32:17).</p><p>More than one demon can possess a human body (Mark 16:9). But a demon can possess only one body. The evil angels are the rulers of this world, while the little demons are out to frustrate men, to torment men, to drive men to insanity, and to motivate men to worship idols. When demons attach themselves to idols, they seduce men to worship them and rob men of their worship of the true God.</p><h2 class="head2">Physical Materials</h2><p>First John 5:19 says, "The whole world lies in the evil one." Satan is the prince of this world, and the whole world, including man, is under his domination. In order to deal with ordinary men, he only needs to release the little demons. But in order to deal with godly men who stand absolutely one with God, like Daniel, he has to call in the princes. (Of course, God also sends angels to protect these godly ones.)</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF SATAN'S KINGDOM</h2><p>Satan's tightly organized kingdom and numerous messengers exist for the sole purpose of achieving his evil goal. Satan desires four things:</p><p>(1) In eternity he wanted to be the Most High (Isa. 14:14).</p><p>(2) In the garden of Eden he wanted to be like God (Gen. 3:5).</p><p>(3) In the wilderness he wanted to be worshipped (Luke 4:7).</p><p>(4) In the temple he will want to be God (2 Thes. 2:4).</p><p>Satan's consistent goal is to be God and to be worshipped as God. In order to achieve this, he has formed a tightly organized kingdom. He controls all the materials in it on the one hand, and he tries to build up his kingdom on earth on the other hand. He knows that God eventually will establish His kingdom on earth, and he has gone a step ahead of God to establish his own. Genesis 6 reveals how Satan corrupted the men God had created. In Genesis 11, Satan instigated men to corporately rebel against God by building the tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. In Egypt Satan used Pharaoh to persecute the Israelites (Exo. 1:8-22). The great image in Daniel 2:31-43 signifies the earthly kingdoms which are established by Satan himself. These kingdoms up- lift men, rebel against God, and withstand God's kingdom (which at that time was Israel).</p><h2 class="head1">THE METHODS OF SATAN'S KINGDOM</h2><h2 class="head2">His Work in the World</h2><p>(1) Blinding men's thoughts (2 Cor. 4:4).</p><p>(2) Stealing men's worship (Rev. 13:12).</p><p>(3) Snatching away God's word which men have heard, so that men forget what they have heard (Matt. 13:19).</p><p>(4) Bringing in counterfeits&mdash;religion and morality (1 Tim. 4:1-3).</p><p>Satan knows that God hates the flesh. Therefore, he pretends to hate it by instigating men to be vegetarians and to abstain from marriage. He also wins men's hearts by promoting culture and science, creating confusion to convince men of their impotence, and creating false peace to cover up his darkness.</p><h2 class="head2">His Work in the Church</h2><p>(1) Persecutions, threats (Rev. 2:10; Acts 5:28).</p><p>(2) Attacks on the body (2 Cor. 12:7).</p><p>(3) Counterfeits, slanders, and lies (2 Cor. 11:13-15; Rev. 2:9; 3:9).</p><p>(4) Filling men's hearts and causing men to become covetous (Acts 5:3). This shows us that it is difficult to separate Satan from money.</p><p>We have to pay attention to Satan's works. Concerning everything that happens to us, we should not ask what it is but where it is coming from. It is not a matter of good or bad but a matter of the source. Everything that Satan does is with a view to increase his power, kingdom, and authority. He is doing everything he can to oppose God. He exhausts all of his tactics and employs all of his messengers to do just one thing&mdash;win men over. The kind of people he is most afraid of are those who do God's will. Today God's goal is to gain men who will destroy all the works of Satan. Satan's goal is to win men over to oppose God's will. This is a warfare between two thrones. God wants men to destroy Satan's will, while Satan wants men to destroy God's will. May the Lord clearly show us Satan's kingdom, organization, and evil plots. May God cause us to be those who only love His will so that we can deal with Satan, His adversary.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 44: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (4) &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
