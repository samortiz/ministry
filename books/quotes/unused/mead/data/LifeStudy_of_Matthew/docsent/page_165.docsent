   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 6:9 tells us that the five loaves are barley loaves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In figure, barley typifies the resurrected Christ Lev 23:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While the loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ s life, the fishes are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To satisfy our spiritual hunger, we need Christ s generating life as well as His redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both of these aspects are symbolized by small items loaves and fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that the heavenly King did not come to His followers in this age to reign over them as a great King, but as small pieces of food to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With an Overflow</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 20 says, And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments, twelve baskets full.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Twelve baskets full of fragments indicate not only that the resurrected Christ is unlimited and inexhaustible, but also that the Lord s provision for us is abundant, more than sufficient to meet all our need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The five loaves and two fishes satisfied about five thousand men, apart from women and children v. 21 . What we offer to the Lord may be very little; but the blessing will be great, and the overflow, the surplus, will be greater than what we offered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What we offer to the Lord cannot be exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, it will be used by the Lord to bless others abundantly, even with a surplus, to testify that this is the Lord s marvelous doing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this record of the miracle, the Holy Spirit s intention in His inspiration is to show that the real need of the followers of the heavenly King is the proper food to satisfy their hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The disciples of Christ did not know this, nor did the crowds who followed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heavenly King knew this and would do something miraculously to impress them with their real need and His provision for that need.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All they needed was His resurrection life to satisfy their spiritual hunger, as signified in this miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What the heavenly King did also clearly indicates that He provides for the necessities of His followers while they follow Him in this rejecting world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This corresponds with His word in the heavenly constitution that the kingdom people need not be anxious concerning what they shall eat 6:31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In following the rejected King, we must pass through many kinds of rejections.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After these rejections, we shall be in want and have certain needs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But do not worry about your needs or be anxious concerning them, for the Lord takes care of them, even at the end of the day in a desert place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord has a way to meet your need.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Simply offer what you are and what you have into His hand, let Him break the offering, and let the broken offering feed the hungry ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do this, you will enjoy satisfaction, and there will be a surplus remaining.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What the rejected King did in 14:14-21 was not merely a miracle to feed people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The miracle here indicates that as the rejected King, Christ has the adequate, sufficient, rich life supply for His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He not only takes care of our physical and material needs; He also affords the life supply to satisfy our hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many of us can testify that after passing through rejection, we came into a situation where we had a shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, the Lord took care of us, and we did not lack anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, we did not care about the material supply, but about the life supply to satisfy our spiritual hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we follow the rejected King on the pathway to glory, we can testify that we are enjoying the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, we are feeding others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And after such an enjoyment, there are still twelve baskets full of life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we can say that this pathway is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although here we have rejection and want, He is our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He takes care of our physical needs and renders the rich life supply, even with an overflow, to meet our spiritual need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we can say, The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only are we without want we are rich, we are satisfied, and we have twelve baskets full.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>With Him we have the material supply and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we follow Him, even in the desert, we enjoy Him as our source of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, we are not afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because He is with us, we shall not want.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we have His presence, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We welcome the rejection and, in a sense, we even welcome the situation of being in want, for we have Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our need affords Him an excellent opportunity to do something for us.</S>
