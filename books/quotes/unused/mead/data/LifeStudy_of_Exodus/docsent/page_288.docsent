   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE EIGHTY-SIX THE ARK OF THE TESTIMONY 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 25:17-22; Lev 16:14-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the two foregoing messages we considered the materials of the ark, the dimensions of the ark, and the rim of gold around the top of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have also considered the four rings of gold and the two poles used for the move of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall consider from 25:17-22 the propitiatory cover which was put on the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>X. THE PROPITIATORY COVER</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Exodus 25:17 says, And you shall make a propitiatory cover of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its width.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This propitiatory cover was the lid of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Septuagint the Greek translation of the Old Testament made before the time of Christ the word hilasterion is used to translate the Hebrew word for propitiatory cover.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This Greek word is a noun form of the Greek verb hilaskomai.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hilaskomai means to appease, to reconcile two parties by satisfying the demand of one upon the other, that is, to propitiate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Hebrews 2:17, the Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God s righteous demands on us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose a certain party is indebted to another party.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, he is not able to fulfill the demands of the second party.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There seems to be no way to settle this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then a third party comes on the scene and, on behalf of the first party, fulfills the requirements of the second party, thus appeasing the second party.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way, the first party is reconciled to the second, for the demands of the second party have been satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek word hilaskomai refers to such a transaction in which reconciliation is brought about through the appeasement of a particular party and the satisfaction of his requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ has reconciled us to God by satisfying God s demands on us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek word for propitiation, hilasterion, is different from hilasmos in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hilasmos denotes that which propitiates, that is, a propitiatory sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to 1 John 2:2 and 4:10, the Lord Jesus is the propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is not only the One who reconciles us to God by fulfilling God s requirements and appeasing Him, but He is also the propitiatory sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He sacrificed Himself that we may be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that Christ is the One who makes propitiation to God for us as well as the One who is the propitiatory sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 3:25 Paul says that Christ is our propitiation-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has set forth Christ to be our hilasterion, our propitiatory cover.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that as the hilasterion Christ is also the very place where God is able to meet with us, His redeemed people, and talk to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, Christ is the One who propitiates, He is the propitiatory sacrifice, and He is the propitiatory cover, the place where God and His redeemed people meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the propitiatory sacrifice and as the One who has made propitiation to God on our behalf, Christ is also the place, called the propitiation-cover in Romans 3:25, where we can meet with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Septuagint uses hilasterion for the lid, or cover, of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul uses this word to refer to Christ as the propitiation-cover.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No doubt, when Paul was writing Romans 3:25 he had in mind a picture of the propitiatory cover placed on the ark of the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>See note 25 1 in Romans 3, Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we study the description of the propitiatory cover in Exodus 25:17-22 and seek to understand its significance for our spiritual experience, we need to receive light through the Word and not mere knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our goal in reading the Bible should be to receive light and not simply to gain objective knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we need to guard against unnecessary questionings and thoughts which interfere with the shining of the light through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, we need to ask meaningful questions concerning what we read in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, we need to avoid useless questions, questions which have no answers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we read the account of the propitiatory cover in Exodus, we may be snared by such questions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, some may ask if the cherubim on the ark are angels.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Others may want to know the weight of the cherubim or how many faces they have.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some may try to figure out the thickness of the propitiatory cover, realizing that the length and the width are given, but not the thickness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some readers may ask if the cherubim and the lid of the ark were all one piece of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Other readers may wonder how the cherubim can have their faces toward each other and also toward the lid of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this message we shall not be concerned with questions such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, our aim is to consider those matters crucial for our spiritual understanding and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we come to these verses not to find answers to unnecessary questions, but to obtain light from the Lord.</S>
