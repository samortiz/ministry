   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FRUIT-BEARING BEING THE REAL ENJOYMENT OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul said, "For woe to me if I do not preach the gospel" 1 Cor 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not preaching the gospel is a woe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus said that if we, His branches, do not bear fruit, we will be cut off John 15:2, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be cut off is to lose the enjoyment of the full, rich supply of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why many Christians are so poor in the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have lost the full enjoyment of the riches of Christ due to the fact that they have not borne fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though we do not bear fruit, we are still in the Lord, but we cannot have the real enjoyment of the rich supply of the life-juice of the vine tree.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we do not have the enjoyment of the rich supply of Christ's life-juice, we have been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not we have been cut off is determined by whether we have the real enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The main lack of many Christians is that they do not have a life of regular fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must rise up to practice fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>AVOIDING DEBATE AND REDEEMING OUR TIME TO SAVE SINNERS FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians are fighting, debating, and arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without exception, as long as Christians are occupied with fighting and debating, the result will be barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even though they feel they are fighting for the Lord and defending the truth, the issue of their fighting is that there is no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times I have seen a group of Christians doing quite well until they began debating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once they began to debate in the name of defending the truth, they began to decline in number.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever debating comes in, the best way to stand against it is to "Go!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not care for debating but for getting people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must go to get a number of people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may say that we are wrong if we care for numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the Bible cares about numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is even a book of the Bible called Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God told Moses and Aaron to count, to number, the people Num 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should number the people in the church in our locality Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do this, we will be aware of our negligence in bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our urgent need is to go to get people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of debating, we should prefer to save at least one person today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we baptize someone into the Triune God, we feel glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The glorious way is to save sinners and count them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If someone comes to us to debate about the truth, we should simply say that we do not have time for that.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we may ask him if his parents and relatives have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they have not been saved, we can pray with him for them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not debate concerning what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have not been appointed to be a judge, and we do not have time for debating.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must give our time to save sinners and to feed and nourish the young ones in order to help them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must go to visit people and preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord did not tell us to go to the "right" persons and not to go to the "wrong" ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He simply told us to go!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, we should go to visit the homes Luke 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we should visit every city and place Luke 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, we must go to the entire world Matt 24:14; 28:19; Acts 1:8 .</S>
