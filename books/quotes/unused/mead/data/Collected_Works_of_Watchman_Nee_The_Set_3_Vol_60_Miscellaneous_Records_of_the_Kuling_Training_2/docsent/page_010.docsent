   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIVIDING OF THE SOUL AND SPIRIT AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BREAKING OF THE OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: What is the difference between the sense of the spirit and the feelings of the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: The more one tries to distinguish the sense of the spirit and the feelings of the soul, the more confused he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only an experienced person can differentiate the spirit from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is God's business to divide our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As God performs a special work of breaking and tearing down our outer man, we will be clear about the dividing of our soul from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all have strong spots.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once these strong spots are crushed, our spirit will come out, and our soul will be put to use.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the outer man is broken, the inner man will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our outer man is a shell; it exists on this earth for the purpose of interacting with outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The inner man is our true self.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those whose spirit is divided from their soul have a great gulf separating the outer man from the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those whose spirit and soul are separated can be very busy in the outer man, but their inner man is untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not affected by the outside world, and it remains in God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, one brother had a very tragic experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet under God's special mercy, he remained calm and peaceful inside in spite of the outward pains.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God set the peace as a gulf, a separating wall, between him and his outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is God's great mercy to break down our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The breaking enables us to always abide in the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the outer man is broken, the inner man seems to have moved its home.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is no longer affected by the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The inner man belongs to us; it is deep, and it is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The outer man is shallow; it is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the outer man is not broken, we will never be able to tell the difference between the outer man and the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CHRISTIAN VIRTUE AND WORLDLY ASCETICISM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Question: What is the difference between Christian virtue and worldly asceticism?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Answer: A proper Christian will convey a sense of God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will incite others to worship and glorify God, but those who cultivate themselves merely build up themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They only give others a taste of man, and they draw praises to man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more they practice asceticism, the stronger their self becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In fact, the more "virtuous" a person is, the more he gives others the feeling that he is above them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more a Christian is broken, the less others will be conscious of him, and the humbler he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others will only touch God in him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more a worldly person practices self-denial, the greater his self becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We find this particularly prevalent in India.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Indian philosophy far excels the ethics of most ordinary men and women.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet no one touches God through this philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Christian who takes up the cross, however, whether he is a Chinese, a Japanese, or an Englishman, gives others the impression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They cause others to worship God and to glorify Him.</S>
