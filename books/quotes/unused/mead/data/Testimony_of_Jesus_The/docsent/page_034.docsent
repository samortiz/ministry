   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REVELATION UNVEILING THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation 1:2 speaks of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For many years I have considered this term the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, I was taught that if we have good behavior, we will present the testimony of Jesus to people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that we, the believers, must behave ourselves, love our neighbor, honor our parents, love our wife, and submit to our husband.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time I accepted this definition, but gradually I began to feel that it is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a definition does not belong in the concluding book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever is in the conclusion of the Bible must be something higher.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After this, I began to look to the Lord for the way to understand the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Gradually I saw the proper meaning, but for over twelve years I have realized that if I spoke about this matter in an honest and frank way, I would offend many people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Twelve years ago the time was not ripe to speak in this way, even in the Lord s recovery, so the Lord caused me to be patient and wait until another day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Recently, however, the burden came to me that now is the time for the Lord to tell His people clearly and fully what the testimony of Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason I am bold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not care if I am rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I must speak the truth concerning the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all know that a picture is better than a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For this reason, Revelation has not only plain words, but even more it paints a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not know how to understand this painting, we will not be able to understand this book.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first picture is the vision of the seven shining, golden lampstands 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in chapter 4 there are the four living creatures; one is like a lion, the second like a calf, the third having the face of a man, and the fourth like a flying eagle vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the midst of the four living creatures is One who was introduced as the Lion, but when John looked, the Lion became a Lamb 5:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The third vision is of four horses running a race 6:1-8 , a white horse, a red horse, a black horse, and a pale horse.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In chapter 9 there are locusts with tails like scorpions vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>3, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter 12 there is a wonderful woman clothed with the sun, with the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars v. 1 . The woman is about to deliver a child, and before her is a great dragon who tries to devour her child v. 4 . Then in chapter 13 are two beasts, one coming out of the sea and the other coming out the earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1, 11 , and in chapter 16 there are frogs v. 13 ; frogs always come out when the weather is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter 17 there is not a wonderful, universal woman but a great harlot vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1-6 , and in chapter 18 there is a great, evil city that is condemned by God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In chapter 19 there is a clean, neat, bright, white, and pure bride vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>7-8 , clothed in fine linen, with whom there is no mixture, dirt, or spot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in chapter 20 there is the ancient serpent v. 2 , and in chapters 21 and 22 there is the holy city, the New Jerusalem 21:2, 9-27; 22:1-2 . What marvelous pictures these are! We need to see all these pictures, vision after vision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the main, central figure in this whole painting is Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we see all the other items but not this Lion, we will certainly miss the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must turn our eyes away from the frogs, the beasts, the locusts, the dragon, and the serpent and turn our eyes upon this Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This book is the revelation, the unveiling, of this Lion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>HIS FULL EXPRESSION IN THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, this Lion is expressed through some vessels, which are the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>An expression is the full testimony of a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The testimony of Jesus is the expression of Jesus, who is expressed first in the local churches today and eventually in the New Jerusalem in the millennium and in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the churches today are the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God created man in His own image with the intention that man may express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must all realize that our destiny is not to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to forget about all other things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our destiny is to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Genesis, after God created man, He did not tell man to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is because man was made in the image of God simply to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may compare man as the expression of God to a photograph.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A photograph of a person does not worship the person, work for him, or serve him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The destiny of a photograph is simply to express the person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man is a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When God created man, He took a photo of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Just as the function of a photograph is to express a person, man was made to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, many failed God in this very respect, but Psalm 8 tells us that a second man would come to resume the responsibility of man to express God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what Jesus accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>While Jesus was on this earth, He fully expressed God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was the real photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now this one photograph has been reproduced.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are all the reproduced photographs of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, today God has a corporate expression the church which is the testimony of Jesus, who is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The old man Adam was created in God s image, but Adam failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now the church is the new man, which is created in Christ according to the image of God, having Christ as God s expression Eph 4:24; Col 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This expression is the testimony of Jesus, which in Revelation is first the local churches and eventually the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The book of Revelation opens with the seven lampstands, and it concludes with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Both the lampstands and the New Jerusalem are figures of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The seven lampstands are signs of the seven local churches, and the one New Jerusalem is the sign of the ultimate consummation of the church for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Revelation is an unveiling of Christ, and Christ is expressed through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, the church is the testimony of the very Jesus revealed in this book.</S>
