[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE PRESENT SITUATION AND THE FUTURE OUTLOOK THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE CHURCHES IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY
[3]  INTERNAL PROBLEMS AND EXTERNAL TROUBLES IN THE ADVANCE OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY
[4]  While we have been greatly blessed by the Lord during these twenty-three years, nevertheless, we have also experienced many twists and turns, especially in America.
[5]  As a result, after much consideration, we felt that we had to imitate Paul.
[6]  In 1 Corinthians 6 Paul said that it is wrong for brother to go to court with brother, especially before unbelievers v. 6 . However, in Acts 20 and 21 we see a different situation.
[7]  By 1973 and 1974 I began to have the sense that there was still a lack in putting out the intrinsic truths in the Lord's recovery.
[8]  THE FUTURE OUTLOOK The Need for Changing the System
[9]  CHAPTER TWO GOD AND THE WORD BEING GATHERED INTO THE LORD'S NAME
[10]  In Matthew 18:20 the Lord Jesus said, "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst."
[11]  The stomach in our body gives rise not only to the need to eat but also to the need to cook.
[12]  We must see that God is man's greatest need; man simply cannot rid himself of such a need.
[13]  From these five major religions we see that in the universe there is only one God and only one Bible.
[14]  However, if we study the Greek text of the Bible or the English versions, we can see that John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
[15]  Lastly, we want to look at ten major items related to the word of God.
[16]  Therefore, everyone who has been saved and who has His life should learn to speak for Him and to speak His word.
[17]  Even though someone might feel good after he has stolen something, in him there is a sense of justice which condemns his action; this is righteousness.
[18]  As human beings, we are deeply fallen and improper, yet from the time we are young, none of us wants to be a failure, despised by others.
[19]  THE REGENERATED, SAVED PERSONS BEING ABLE TO PROPHESY FOR GOD
[20]  We have already seen that God created us not only to be like Him in having love, light, holiness, and righteousness but also to be like Him in being able to speak.
[21]  However, we need to know what kinds of words God wanted man to speak when He created man with the ability to speak.
[22]  Since we all have been begotten of God, within us we ought to have the "God" tone; whatever we speak, we speak about God.
[23]  AN IMPORTANT HISTORY OF THE PROPAGATION OF THE BIBLE
[24]  The Bible completed through the apostle was an open book intended for all the children of God.
[25]  Therefore, through the Reformation the Bible was firstly unlocked and the word of God was released; secondly, the newspaper was invented as a way to propagate the word of God.
[26]  THE DEGRADED SYSTEM IN CHRISTIANITY SHUTTING UP PEOPLE'S MOUTHS
[27]  Although God's desire is that we all speak for Him, today in Christianity the degraded system of worship services is a system of one man speaking and all the rest listening.
[28]  GOD DESIRING THAT ALL THE PEOPLE OF JEHOVAH BE PROPHETS Having the Full Knowledge of the Truth
[29]  Today the main reason that Christians cannot speak for God is that they do not understand the word of God.
[30]  Therefore, we need to learn to understand the word of God; then we will be able to speak for God.
[31]  We all need to be experienced in the deeper word of God so that when needed we may have the words with which to speak for God.
[32]  CHAPTER FOUR THE CHRISTIAN MEETING BEING A MATTER OF SPEAKING
[33]  The purpose of the Christian meeting is to prophesy, to speak.
[34]  We need the Lord's mercy for this light to shine brighter and brighter among us that we may see that attending the meeting is not "going to church" for the worship of dumb idols.
[35]  When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians chapters twelve through fourteen, he inserted chapter thirteen to speak about love.
[36]  Rather, the Christian meeting is for speaking, for everyone to speak the word of God, for everyone to "play ball."
[37]  The most important items of the manifestation of the Spirit in us are the first two mentioned by Paul: first, a word of wisdom, and second, a word of knowledge v. 8 . Therefore, the "ball" we use is a "wisdom ball" and also a "knowledge ball." Ordinarily, the ball we play with is very simple, but the ball we use in the church meeting is not so simple it is a "wisdom ball" and also a "knowledge ball."
[38]  Some of the believers may say the reason they do not speak is not that they do not want to speak but that they do not know what to speak.
[39]  Therefore, the problem is not only that there are too many "balls" and that we do not know how to select a "ball"; the problem is also that what we have selected might not be fitting, and even when it is suitable, we might not know how to use it.
[40]  Therefore, within some of the saints there is a voice saying, "Let us go back to holding worship services!
[41]  The way of everyone speaking is too hard; let us go back to the way of one person speaking and the rest listening."
[42]  If we look at the various Christian organizations, we can see that they all have a long history, yet they do not have much increase, nor do they allow the Lord to have a way to go on.
[43]  When we come to the meeting, we must be in the Spirit of God, because when we are in the Spirit of God we cannot and will not be dumb.
[44]  Whenever we meet, we are not worshipping the idols, so we should not be dumb; rather, we are breathing a living Lord, so we all must speak for the Lord.
[45]  THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT ITEMS OF THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BELIEVERS BEING THE WORD OF WISDOM AND THE WORD OF KNOWLEDGE
[46]  The Recovery Version of the New Testament has a footnote on that verse, which says, "According to the context of this book, the word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God, predestined by God to be our portion 1:24, 30; 2:6-10 .
[47]  THE CONTENTS OF THE BELIEVERS' MEETINGS BEING PSALMS, TEACHINGS, AND REVELATIONS
[48]  The coming together here refers not to a small meeting, such as a group meeting, but to the big meetings of the church, because verse 23 says, "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place ."
[49]  Not only can we practice singing and speaking to one another while we are in the meetings, but when we go back to our homes and even while we are still on the way, we can also practice this.
[50]  This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching of the teacher to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation of the prophet 1 Cor 14:30 to give visions of God's eternal purpose concerning Christ as God's mystery and the church as Christ's mystery, a tongue for a sign to the unbelievers v. 22 that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable.
[51]  THE MOST PROFITABLE ACTIVITY IN THE CHURCH MEETING BEING PROPHESYING
[52]  The most profitable activity in the church meeting is not the performing of miracles, nor healing, nor the casting out of demons, nor the speaking in tongues, nor the interpreting of tongues.
[53]  The Lord not only gives us the permission and the position; He also gives us the ability so that we "can all prophesy one by one" v. 31 . Therefore, we must see that as those who have been begotten of God, we have the position and the ability to prophesy.
[54]  We must labor on the Lord's word so that when we speak in the meeting, we would speak the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge instead of the loose words, light words, and meaningless tongues.
[55]  To say that the purpose of the Christian meeting is for speaking is altogether against traditional Christianity.
[56]  The three thousand began to meet from house to house no later than the second day after their baptism.
[57]  Since they had only heard one or two messages before they began to meet from house to house, they could not have spoken in the meetings according to the traditional way of the Jews.
[58]  EVERYONE TAKING THE LEAD IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETING
[59]  In the church life we have seen that many brothers want to be the head.
[60]  Due to the degradation of the church, the way of meeting from house to house was completely lost, and thus, the church had no way to propagate and increase.
[61]  A FEW PROPOSALS CONCERNING THE MEETING ON THE LORD'S DAY
[62]  For this kind of practice we have a few proposals.
[63]  No matter how much we stand against the traditions and old habits of Christianity, there will still be some people who want to go to a meeting hall on the Lord's Day to worship God and listen to sermons.
[64]  COMPILING TRUTH LESSONS FOR THE SAINTS TO BE EDUCATED IN THE TRUTH TOGETHER
[65]  To help us learn the truth, we have specifically assigned three co-workers to form an editorial group to compile a book called Truth Lessons.
[66]  In the truth meeting on the Lord's Day, sometimes there may be unbelievers in attendance.
[67]  CHAPTER SIX PROBLEMS TO AVOID IN SPEAKING FOR GOD
[68]  We know that the purpose of all Christian meetings is to speak Christ.
[69]  However, first we must pay attention to the fact that in order to speak Christ we must have the experience of Christ.
[70]  Second, regardless of what we speak about, we need to utter and express it with words; therefore, we need to have the knowledge of the truth.
[71]  Therefore, after much consideration, we feel that we have no alternative but to change the system.
[72]  In the church meetings there are relatively fewer people to whom we can speak for God, but outside the meetings there are many to whom we can speak.
[73]  We would like to fellowship concerning some of the things we should absolutely avoid when we speak for God.
[74]  Those who know a little about farming know that when a farmer farms his field, there are certain things he must avoid so that the growth of the crop will not be hampered.
[75]  In 1933, Brother Watchman Nee began publishing a little magazine called Collection of Newsletters, mainly to publish the fellowship among the churches raised up by the Lord in various places in China.
[76]  Due to the lack of correspondence, the churches were not receiving news of each other, so Brother Nee published this magazine to allow the churches to receive this news.
[77]  At present, the same kind of problem exists in all the localities we are not in perfect harmony.
[78]  Although we do not harbor any evil intentions against each other, everyone is speaking according to his own preference.
[79]  Not Being the Head, Not Assuming Any Position, Not Monopolizing, and Not Controlling
[80]  Therefore, the Lord Jesus called these disciples together and said to them, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them .It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave; just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many" vv.
[81]  The third warning is that we must not be divided into parties, and we must not ask people to follow us.
[82]  What Moody meant was, "Since he does not care about our feeling, we cannot do anything about him, so we just have to let him do what he is doing while we do what we should do."
[83]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE WAY TO SPEAK FOR THE LORD OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH MEETINGS THE BUDGET AND OUTLOOK FOR THE ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH
[84]  For the church to advance there is the need to increase and spread.
[85]  The way for the church to increase includes two steps: first, frequently preaching the gospel so that people can be saved and brought to the Lord; second, bringing the saved ones solidly into the church life.
[86]  We must have a way for the church to be able to retain the new believers.
[87]  Based on our past experiences and present observations, we realize that besides speaking for the Lord in the meetings to supply the saints, we also have to speak for the Lord outside of the meetings to retain and perfect the new believers.
[88]  Furthermore, we need to see that our main objective in meeting together with the new ones should not be to exhort them to attend the meetings, to be zealous, and to serve.
[89]  Rather, we should go to feed them and to minister to them.
[90]  No matter what we are learning in the church meetings, whether it is something from the Truth Lessons or from the Life Lessons, we have to be like one who carries hot food from the oven to the new ones who are under our care.
[91]  The second way for us to speak for the Lord outside of the church meetings is to speak to a second category of people our own unbelieving relatives and friends.
[92]  Hence, all of us who hear this message have to make a list of all our unsaved relatives and friends, and then we need to pray for them in a faithful way and preach the gospel and the truth to them.
[93]  When we are learning to speak the truth to people, we also must learn to quote from the Bible and tell them about the wonderful things in the Bible.
[94]  Instead of arguing with people, we should bring them to the Word and read the Word with them.
[95]  If they are not willing to read with us, then we should read a portion to them.
[96]  For example, we may read to them Romans 8:2: "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."
[97]  Most people do not like to hear such words as "judgment" and "out of death into life," but we can tell them that the Lord Jesus said that if we would believe in Him, we would have eternal life and would not come into judgment but would pass out of death into life.
[98]  There is a real story which took place in Tsinan, Shantung in China.
[99]  At that time he had not yet believed in the Lord, but there was a believer, a brother who loved the Lord very much, who was working under him.
[100]  If we enter into the truth and are equipped with the truth, and if at the same time we also receive the burden from the Lord in prayer, then we will naturally take care of the new believers whom we are feeding by speaking the truth to them frequently.
