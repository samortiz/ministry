   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE FUNCTION OF THE SMALL GROUP A FEW MATTERS REGARDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FORMATION OF SMALL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Concerning the formation of small groups, a few points need to be explained clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, a small group is the gathering of a small number of neighboring believers; it is not a unit of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, instead of designating the coming together of a small group as a meeting, it would be more appropriate and accurate to call it a gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a slight difference between a meeting and a gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a few saints gather for fellowship, it should not be considered as a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A small group is a gathering, not an organized entity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church life, organization kills the saints, but the absence of organization enlivens the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, for the sake of convenience, a brother or sister must be able to attend any small group according to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is very important for us to see that the small groups are not organized units.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we consider a small group as an organized unit, the saints will be restricted in their ability to gather with a group according to their schedule and responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Small groups are not units of organization; they should be formed for the convenience of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the saints should not be limited to one group.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, the convenience of a saint does not mean that natural preferences and fleshly choices are acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Natural preferences and fleshly choices must be avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do not attend a small group because there is a brother or sister whom we dislike in the group, this is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The works of the flesh will result in corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not do anything according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, if we choose to join a group that has a spiritual giant, rather than a group composed of seemingly ordinary saints, we will gain very little.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is not mocked.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should trust in God instead of putting too much trust in the condition of a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Often God s blessing can be restricted if the saints in a group are too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is the God of orphans and widows.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to humble ourselves before the Lord, looking to Him as if we were infants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who think they are capable are denied His blessings, but whenever we sincerely say, Lord, I do not know what to do; I truly am nothing, the blessing comes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must trust in the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In following the Lord s leading, we should not feel as if we are restricted to fellowshipping with only one group.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After a period of time, the Lord may lead us to fellowship with a different group.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are no rigid rules in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, we should not make a change based on natural likes and dislikes, much less based on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Choices based on preferences and the flesh violate a spiritual law, and once a spiritual law is violated, there can be no blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, the small groups are not religious organizations; therefore, no responsible ones should be assigned to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The practice of having no one assigned to take the lead is to not take the way of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every organization depends upon a leading one, a responsible one, but based on our experience, a leading one often replaces the saints and kills their organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord Jesus appointed twelve apostles, He did not designate a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the names of the apostles are listed in the Bible, Peter is usually mentioned first Matt 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14; Acts 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Galatians 2:9, however, James is mentioned first.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we cannot say that Peter was always the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, in our small group gatherings, no one has been given the responsibility to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Under normal circumstances, the grace that one has at the time of the gathering is the source of the group s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to grace and fact, there will always be a leader, but this leading will not be based on a position or title.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everyone should be a leader in a small group because everyone has the same obligation and same opportunity to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Third, a small group should not pay attention to religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today in the Sunday worship services in Christianity, hymns are sung, prayers are offered, the Word is read, and sermons are preached according to set procedures; these procedures are religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though these practices are not sinful, they kill the spirit within the believers and virtually annul their organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Overcoming this deadening condition is a focus of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord s recovery is to recover the exercise of the spirit and the organic functioning of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, when we come together, we should not be concerned with religious rituals; as long as someone has a burden to pray or sing, he should function accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I began meeting in Christianity when I was a child.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For over seventy years, I have seen many different situations.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A considerable number of believers wait for a meeting to begin, but the Bible does not tell us when a meeting should begin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we have set a time to gather together, there is nothing wrong with coming early and beginning to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is to have the fact of a beginning but not the formality of one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A small group recently testified that they met from 8:30 P.M. to after 11 P.M., with different saints coming at different times.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a real break from religion and a genuine group gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to be flexible in the time of our group gatherings; otherwise, some saints may be shut outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to cast off the old ways that we have been following for decades, and the best way to cast them off is to gather in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In practicing to gather in small groups, we should focus on exercising to touch spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we exercise in this way, there will surely be a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Fourth, the small groups are for fellowship in order to shepherd, teach, and mutually care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I go to different places to meet, the saints all think that I do not need any shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Little do they realize that I also need to be shepherded.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever I go to a place, I truly look forward to the mutual shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We all need mutual shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>None of us should be so proud as to think that we do not need any shepherding or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Lambs are not the only ones in need of shepherding; even old sheep need to be shepherded.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In fact, the older a person is, the more he needs to be cared for and shepherded.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Furthermore, we need to have a mutual concern and care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christians are members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When one member suffers, all the members suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to have a concern and care for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This cannot be accomplished in large meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Even if only one hundred people gathered together, it would be hard to show much concern and care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, the concern and care that a member needs is easy to find in a group of ten or less saints.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When a small number of saints gather together, it is easy to understand the conditions and situations of the other saints, which brings in true concern and care.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This gives the Holy Spirit a great opportunity to grant us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Fifth, we need to avoid worldliness in the small groups, especially in matters of eating, drinking, and pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In a gathering of a certain group, everyone sat around the table eating from a hot pot.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They chatted as they ate, and a newly saved sister was stumbled and no longer wanted to gather with the small group.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is eating, drinking, and having pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Pleasures in the Bible is not a good word.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>James 4:3 says, You ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend it on your pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If a small group occasionally has a love feast, it should be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A small group also should avoid celebrations.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In a small group, those who gather together will become quite familiar with one another after a short period of time, and in their effort to render care to one another, some may think that occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries should be celebrated.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, we need to avoid mixing these occasions with the gathering of a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A small group gathering is not an occasion for celebrations.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We are members of Christ; hence, our coming together is for the purpose of fellowshipping with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should avoid worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Sixth, we need to avoid socializing.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>There is no place for vain talk or personal friendships in a small group, and even our fellowship should not be based on personal attachments.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There should only be fellowship and love in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Seventh, a small group is not an independent entity; it is only a small part of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>According to experience, some people like to be first, and they form small parties.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In his third Epistle, John spoke of Diotrephes, who loved to be first among them v. 9 . Using a small group to form a small party or a faction is not acceptable; there is only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>A small group is not an independent entity, a body ; it is only a small part in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It can never become an independent entity.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>A small group must be according to the following principles.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The saints in a small group are under the leadership of the elders in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the only leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Even if there are eight hundred small groups, they are all still under the leadership of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Furthermore, every small group must be open to the other groups in a local church, welcoming and accepting brothers and sisters from any other small group.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In addition, the saints in a small group should not exclude other brothers and sisters or compete with other small groups.</S>
