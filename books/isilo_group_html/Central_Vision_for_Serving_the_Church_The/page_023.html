and to Meet Our High Priest</h2>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.&rdquo; The beginning of this verse uses the conjunctive adverb <em>therefore,</em> showing that verse 14 is a continuation of the preceding verses. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace.&rdquo; This verse also uses the conjunctive adverb <em>therefore,</em> indicating that it is a continuation of the preceding verses. According to verse 14, our High Priest has passed through the heavens. How can we contact a high priest who is high above in heaven when we are still on the earth? Verse 16 says that we should come forward to the throne of grace. <em>The throne of grace</em> refers to God&rsquo;s throne in heaven. In order to contact Christ as our High Priest, we must come forward to the throne of grace; when we come forward to the throne of grace, we will surely meet Him. However, since both our High Priest and the throne of God are in heaven, how can we go there? It seems as though verse 16 is not related to the preceding verses.</p>
<p>However, our spirit is not only the place that God prepared as a rest for His people; it is also connected to heaven. Our spirit and heaven are connected. Hence, when we turn to our spirit, we enter into and enjoy the rest that God has prepared for His people. At the same time, we also come to God&rsquo;s throne of grace to meet our High Priest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Spirit Being the Gate of Heaven</h2>
<p>Our spirit is &ldquo;the gate of heaven&rdquo; in Genesis 28:17. Verses 17 through 19 say, &ldquo;This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob...called the name of that place Bethel.&rdquo; Bethel, God&rsquo;s house, is the gate of heaven. Ephesians 2:22 says that God&rsquo;s dwelling place is in our spirit. In other words, our spirit is Bethel; it is God&rsquo;s house, His habitation.</p>
<p>Genesis 28:12 says, &ldquo;There was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.&rdquo; At Bethel there was a ladder that reached to heaven. For this reason, Bethel was called the gate of heaven. In John 1:51 the Lord identified Himself as the ladder reaching to heaven: &ldquo;You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.&rdquo; On the one hand, the Lord Jesus is in heaven, but on the other hand, He is in our spirit. As a ladder, He reaches heaven at one end and our spirit at the other end. Through Him our spirit and heaven are connected. Now our spirit is the gate of heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Rest by Turning to Our Spirit<br />
to Enjoy the Care of Christ as the High Priest<br />
and the Supply of the Throne of Grace</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ, our High Priest, and the throne of grace are in heaven. At the throne of grace there is mercy and grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16). When we receive mercy from God and find grace to meet our timely need, we have rest. We experience this rest when we turn to our spirit, because our spirit is connected to heaven. Furthermore, Christ our High Priest is touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and supplies all our needs. He takes care of all our needs.</p>
<p>The throne of grace is the source of our supply. This throne is the throne of God and of the Lamb in Revelation 22:1. Out from this throne there proceeds a river of water of life, bright as crystal. The tree of life grows on this side and on that side of the river of water of life, supplying life as food (v. 2). We receive mercy and find grace so that we may have the supply of life. As a result, we enjoy rest.</p>
<p>The rest that remains for God&rsquo;s people is in our spirit. Furthermore, our spirit is connected to heaven. Hence, Christ cares for us as our High Priest, and God&rsquo;s throne of grace supplies us in our spirit. In our spirit we receive mercy, find grace, and enjoy the timely supply. This is our rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SPIRIT BEING THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>Hebrews 10:19 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus.&rdquo; The Holy of Holies is our spirit. We can say this because this verse says that we have boldness to enter the Holy of Holies. Bible expositors agree that the Holy of Holies is the third heaven. But if the Holy of Holies is the third heaven, how can we enter it? The Holy of Holies in this verse refers to our spirit. When we are in our spirit, we are in the Holy of Holies. Our spirit is connected to heaven; hence, when we are in our spirit, we are in heaven.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
