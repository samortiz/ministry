   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECOGNIZING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 9 is the case of a man blind from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The disciples had learned a certain amount of theology among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to their theology they reckoned that if a man is born blind, there must have been someone who sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They asked the Lord, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?" v. 2 . Jesus answered, "Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him" v. 3 . This case is a small one, but its principle is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we encounter a situation of blindness, we like to determine the reason for it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We consider whether it was due to our sin or due to others' mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Quite often we cannot find out whose mistake it was.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not know whether it was due to ourselves, our parents, or our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must realize that God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God allowed a man to be born blind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This was not due to his parents' sin or his own, but that God would use this blindness to show His mighty work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to come into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One needed to be born blind so that Christ might do something for him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If no one had been blind, there would have been no opportunity for the Lord Jesus to be manifested by healing such blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 4 the sinful and clever woman raised the question of worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter eight the scribes and Pharisees raised a question concerning the laws, the regulations, in their religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now in chapter nine the disciples raised a good question of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The question of who was at fault for the blindness of the man was a question of theology.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, theology is not adequate to answer this question.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many things happen to us which are not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To our realization and analysis there is no reason for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, these things did not happen spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They happened according to God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes young people who get married repent of their decision after three days.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some have come to me saying they made a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were told that they should be very careful in this matter, but they did not take the word of advice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, they repented.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is good that they repented, but what shall they do now?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They have to suffer for the rest of their life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may ask in a theological way, "Whose mistake was this?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot say whose mistake it was.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet, there was a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seems that there was no cause for this mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, deep within I have realized that the cause was the sovereignty of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is sovereign that you seem to have married the wrong person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a certain sense, there are not many right marriages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After being married for a certain period of time, whose marriage is still so right?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we have to admit that God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every marriage is under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is neither your mistake nor your spouse's. It is God's sovereignty that you were married.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By reading history and biographies we can learn that thousands of Christians received the greatest help through their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one can help you so much in seeking after God as your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank God for your dear wife.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many wives also would thank God for their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Along with all the suffering they may have received from their husbands, there has been something so profitable for them; by no other means could they have been so benefited.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our marriage is not up to our choice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regardless of how much we exercise in choosing our spouse, we may make a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more careful we would be, the more serious a mistake we might make.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every parent wants to have good children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, experienced parents do not dare to say that their children will be the best.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the matter of raising children, the experienced parents have been subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not up to us whether our children will be good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That is altogether up to the sovereignty of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you have good children, you have to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have some bad children, you have to worship God more because you will be much more benefited.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We might prefer that our first child obtain a Ph.D., that the second be a medical doctor, and that the third be the state governor.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We want a wonderful family with wonderful children.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We would say, "Look at this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Isn't this the blessing of God?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In actuality, however, our first child may have a very low IQ, the second one may be crippled, and the third one may be rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not one of them may be good.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Quite often it happens this way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We believe in God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Regardless of what kind of circumstance or situation we are in, it is sovereign of God that He might show His mercy upon us and give us more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The man in John 9 was blind from birth apparently without cause.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But this afforded Jesus Christ the best opportunity to manifest the works of God, to show that God can make a man who was blind from birth receive his sight.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This was something of God for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not talk about things according to our theology or knowledge, analyzing the cause.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must admit that God's sovereignty prevails.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whether you will get a better job or lose your current job is altogether up to God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do hope that many will have a pleasant church life, but only God knows whether or not our life will be pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, we can be assured that whatever turns out, we are under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God's sovereignty always results in His kindness, grace, peace, and security to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We all must learn not to analyze any situation according to "yes" or "no," but according to the very sovereign God.</S>
