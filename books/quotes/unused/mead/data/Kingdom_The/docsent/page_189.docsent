   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRSTFRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before the harvest was reaped in Revelation 14:14, there had been a reaping already.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 14:1 says, "And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Revelation 14:4, these are the firstfruit to God and to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are standing, not in the air, but upon the throne, upon mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This refers to mount Zion in the heavens where God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the firstfruit went, not to the air, that is, to the barn, but directly to the Father's home in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The harvest, however, will go into the barn, into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE MAN-CHILD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Revelation 12:5 says, "And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who was about to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The man-child, the overcomers, will not be caught up to the air, but to the throne of God in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The harvest goes to the air which corresponds to the barn, but the firstfruit goes to mount Zion to the throne of God which corresponds to the farmer's home.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The man-child is also raptured to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Old Testament presents a clear type of this principle in Exodus 23:19.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There it says that the firstfruits of the land shall be brought into the house of the Lord thy God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The firstfruits do not go into the barn, but directly into God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that the firstfruits are for the satisfaction of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By this we can see that the rapture of the Christians will not occur only at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First there is the rapture of the firstfruit, and then there is the rapture of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The firstfruit will be raptured to the third heavens, but the harvest will be raptured to the air.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE TIME OF</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE RAPTURE OF THE MAN-CHILD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to Revelation 12:5-6, after the rapture of the man-child, that is, after the overcomers have been caught up to the third heavens, there will still be another 1,260 days or three and one-half years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most Bible students realize that these three and one-half years will be the second half of the last week mentioned in Daniel 9.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the end of Daniel 9, there are seventy weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, there are seven weeks plus sixty-two weeks, altogether sixty-nine weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then eventually there is the last week.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A week here indicates seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This seven-year period is divided into two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first part is of three and one-half years, and the second part is of three and one-half years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The three and one-half years is mentioned both in Daniel and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes it is mentioned in this way: a time, times, and a half Dan 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That means one year, two years, and one-half year or three and one-half years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At other times it is designated as forty-two months or 1,260 days Rev 11:2-3; 12:6; 13:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The three and one-half years, the forty-two months, or the 1,260 days all refer to the same period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The man-child will be raptured in the middle of the last week, which means after his rapture there will be another three and one-half years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that there is more than one rapture of the saints just as there is more than one reaping of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, there will be the reaping of the firstfruit, and then the reaping of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely the reaping of the firstfruit will be earlier, and the reaping of the harvest will be later.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Leviticus 23:22, there will be even a further reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the reaping of the firstfruits, and the reaping of the general harvest, some of the grains will still not be ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These are the grains which are in the corners of the field and need more time to ripen under the hot sun.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Leviticus 23 these late-ripening ones are called gleanings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In principle, God's harvest will also be gathered in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some will be gathered as the firstfruit, most will be gathered as the harvest, and a few will be left in the world as gleanings in the corners to be harvested at a later time, after the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In a wheat field, the grains which ripen first are those nearer the center of the field, whereas the grains on the edges ripen last.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They have to be left for a longer time in the field to be scourged and burned by the bright sun.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then they too will be ripened and ready to harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we desire to ripen early, we need to be in the center of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not stay on the edges of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do, you may be left to ripen in the field.</S>
