<h2 class="head2">Making a List</h2><p>Fifth, why should we have the saints make a list? We do not want anyone to go to the extreme. It is wrong to overdo a matter or to come short in it. The church has to walk according to truth; it has to go on step by step in a responsible way. Those who act by their emotion tend to overdo. We should not act by our emotion. We want the brothers and sisters to fellowship with the responsible brothers in the process of their dealing. The purpose of making a list is to give room for consideration. Based on these lists, the responsible ones should carefully discuss the matter with the consecrated brothers and sisters. Some have too much land or too much of other things, and they can give it to the church. For example, some may own land that is suitable for building a meeting hall for the church. The church can accept this land. In Foochow we need at least four meeting halls. I hope we can find land for them. Some items may be useful to others and should not be sold. The practice of making a list is not recorded in Acts. But it is a measure to deal with the excess. This is a matter of doing things according to proper procedure. The purpose of doing this is to avoid mistakes. The saints should make a list and ask the responsible brothers in the church to go over it with them. The list is a means to facilitate our handling of the matter.</p><h2 class="head2">Continuous Offering</h2><p>Sixth, it is not the end once a man has handed over his all. Any income received after one has handed over his all should be kept only insofar as it is necessary to maintain his livelihood. The remainder should be handed over continually. Every month or every week, a person has to keep what he needs to sustain his living. He should place the rest in God's hand. After a man has handed over his all, he will certainly become richer because he who sows much surely will reap much. Our consecration must be a continuous act.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Those Who Are in Business</h2><p>Seventh, we have a question for the brothers and sisters who are still in business: "Do you have a heart to consecrate everything?" Some people can bring their Isaac home without any trouble. Others flounder in their consecration as soon as they bring home their Isaac. Before Abraham could apply a knife to his son, he first had to apply it to himself. If, at that critical juncture, after Abraham had offered up Isaac, you had handed back Abraham's son to him and moved him back to his former position, he would not have been disturbed at all. It would not have changed anything in him. If he had never applied the knife to himself first and if there had never been a wound in him in the first place, you would spoil him by applying oil to him. Without a wound, there can be no blessing. With the brothers who are engaged in business or commerce, whatever needs to be dealt with has to be dealt with. It is better to deal with it time after time than to keep it in one's possession continually. We would rather deal with a person's possession first and then return it back to him later. It is not too good to bind something up with oil before it has ever passed through a dealing. After one has passed through a dealing, he can go on with his business or he can change it. The choice is determined by the need.</p><h2 class="head1">PRINCIPLES OF THE PRACTICE OF SELLING ALL</h2><p>We are conducting an operation. But our operation is different from a surgical operation that a doctor performs. Before a doctor performs a surgery, he first applies anesthesia. Our operation, however, is for the purpose of hurting. Spiritual operations have no need of anesthetic. We are not after man's wealth; we are after men who will forsake all. Therefore, the principle of dealing with the disposed goods is to bring the maximum spiritual benefit to men. We will not and cannot uphold any other principles. You may say that I am cruel. Yes, I am cruel. I want to see wounds in the brothers and sisters. It is a great blessing to have wounds. I want you to deal with your possessions to the point that you have wounds. It has to be a consecration that brings tears, that hurts. It is all right to hurt; this is the only way blessing will flow. First, ask the consecrated ones to pour out the wine generously. Do not apply the oil on them too soon. The greater the wound, the greater will be the result.</p><p>Having said this, we have to give others the assurance that the church always makes the best provisions. Even if the church makes some mistakes occasionally, the saints should bear with them. The church can be wrong at times, but the discipline of the Holy Spirit can never be wrong. Our experience may tell us that an arrangement of the church is not that suitable, but at least we can experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit. We have to practice this conscientiously according to the revelation of God's Word. If we do this, we will receive the blessing.</p>
