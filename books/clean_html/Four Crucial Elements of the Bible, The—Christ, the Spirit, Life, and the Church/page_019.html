<h2 class=head2>Animals</h2><p>Now we come to the category of animals. This is even more mysterious. Christ is a lamb, an ox, a lion, an eagle, a dove, and a turtledove. As a lamb, He became an offering to deal with our sins for our redemption. As an ox, He was not only made an offering but also became lowly to bear our burdens as a slave of God for us. As a lion, He is the victorious One overcoming Satan on our behalf. As an eagle, He is the transcendent and heavenly One who carries us that we may rise above everything. As a dove, He is beautiful and guileless, and as a turtledove, He is lowly and poor. Furthermore, these types have their sequences. First there is the dove and then the eagle; first there is the Lamb which was slain and then the overcoming Lion of the tribe of Judah. Christ is not only the cattle and the fowl, but He is even the bronze serpent. He told Nicodemus, “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up” (John 3:14). This means that when He was crucified on the cross, He was the bronze serpent, which had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent’s poison. He had the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3) but was without the reality of sin (Heb. 4:15; 2 Cor. 5:21). Christ is One who is truly rich.<h2 class=head2>Plants</h2><p>Among the plants, there are even more types concerning Christ. The Lord said that He is the true vine (John 15:1). There is only one vine in the universe that is true, and this true vine is Christ. Song of Songs 2:3 says that He is the apple tree. Moreover, the Old Testament tells us that the different parts of a tree are also types of Christ: Christ is the root (Isa. 11:10; Rev. 5:5), the stem, and the stump; He is also the branch (Isa. 11:1) and the fruit (4:2; Rev. 22:2). Furthermore, the New Testament tells us that He is the fruit of Mary’s womb (Luke 1:42). The most mysterious thing is that Christ is the tree itself. He is the unique tree of life in the universe. He is also the acacia wood, which signifies that His humanity is noble and strong in quality and lofty and superior in standard. He is truly marvelous!<h2 class=head2>Minerals</h2><p>Now we come to the types seen in the minerals. Christ is the pure gold, silver, brass, and iron (Deut. 8:13, 9). He is different kinds of stone: the living stone (1 Pet. 2:4), the rock (1 Cor. 10:4; 1 Pet. 2:8), the cornerstone (v. 7; Matt. 21:42), the topstone (Zech. 4:7), and the foundation stone (1 Cor. 3:11). If we study the gold, silver, precious stones, and different kinds of stone that are mentioned in the Old Testament, we can see that Christ is not simple.<h2 class=head2>Offerings</h2><p>Furthermore, there are the types seen in the offerings, which are even more difficult to explain. We have covered these to a great extent in the life-studies of the Pentateuch. In the Old Testament, Exodus is an introduction to the offerings, Leviticus is the text, and Numbers and Deuteronomy are the supplements. There are five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. In addition, there are the wave offering, the heave offering, the voluntary offering, and the drink offering. These are all types of Christ.<h2 class=head2>Foods</h2><p>There are also the foods that are types of Christ. As food, Christ is the bread of life (John 6:35), the manna descended from heaven (v. 51), and the hidden manna (Rev. 2:17). He is also various kinds of choice fruits—grapes, figs, pomegranates, and olives (Deut. 8:8). He is the fruit of the tree of life (Rev. 2:7), as well as wheat, barley, milk, and honey (Deut. 8:8; 6:3), to be man’s supply and nourishment.<p>These six major categories in the Old Testament are all types of Christ. Even if you have read through the entire Old Testament, you do not understand it unless you know these six categories. If we thoroughly study these matters, the Old Testament will be transparent and open to us.
