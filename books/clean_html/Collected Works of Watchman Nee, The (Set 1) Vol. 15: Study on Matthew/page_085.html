<P>Verse 1:"And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple." When the disciples looked back to see the temple, they felt that it was most glorious. No nation had such a temple. The stones outside were brightly polished. It was most beautiful. Inside, the vessels were pure gold. It was precious, valuable, and shining.</P><P>Verse 2:"But He answered and said to them, Do you not see all these things?" Does this refer to the stones and the golden vessels? The Lord knew their hearts. "Truly I say to you, There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down." This is the Lord's spiritual insight. What man sees is just what is before the eye and what is outward. But the Lord's sight is penetrating. Man sees the world as beautiful and all the material things as cultured and refined. But according to the Lord's spiritual insight, all elements of material things will be burned away by fire. So why are we concerned with the things of the earth? The temple is a type of the church. But look at today's church. It has only a vain name and has lost its reality. Even though there are good worship services, they inevitably have become like the temple of that day.</P><P>Why did the Lord question the disciples? What the Lord meant is this: "Do you want to understand prophecy? If you want to understand it, you will need to adopt My attitude." Basically, when man looks at the world, he does not think about prophecy. If a believer cannot receive any light from prophecy, it is because he has been veiled by the light from the world. He does not realize that although the world is beautiful and good, eventually it will be burned away. That day will come. Why did the Lord leave such a wonderful temple desolate to them? It is because the glory of the temple is not in the gold, silver, and treasures but in the presence of the Lord. If the Lord has departed, even if there are the gold, silver, and treasures of the whole world, of what use is the temple? Hence, it should not remain. Let us beware of this ourselves, since we are the temple of God. Do we have the presence of God or do we have only the outward appearance?</P><P>"There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down." This verse was literally fulfilled in approximately A.D. 70. When the Roman prince Titus led his soldiers and conquered Jerusalem, he saw the overlaid gold in the temple and ordered all the gold to be stripped. He thought that since the outside was gold, the inside also must be gold. Thus, he turned over all the stones. And so the Lord's word was fulfilled.</P><P>Verse 3:"And as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, When will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming and of the consummation of the age?" The Lord sat upon the Mount of Olives. In the Gospel of Matthew, a mountain is mentioned eight times. Each time something special occurred. In particular, there were two times when the situations on the mountain were about the same: in 5:1 and 24:3. On the mountain in Matthew 5:1 (although it does not mention specifically the mountain's name), the Lord spoke concerning the law of the kingdom of the heavens, the prerequisite for entering into the kingdom of the heavens, for the future reigning with the Lord. In Matthew 24 what He spoke are the prophecies that concern the rapture, the tribulation, and the judgment.</P><P>Why were these things spoken on the mountain? Since they were spoken on the mountain, the listeners must labor to climb the mountain (to pay the price). All those who are not willing to pay the price cannot expect to understand the prophecies. The reason people do not like to listen to prophecies and the reason that they deny the things concerning the Lord's coming is that they are not willing to climb the mountain or to pay the price. Moreover, on the mountain it is quieter. The book of Revelation was received on a desolate island. All those who like excitement are not qualified to study the prophecies.</P><P>The disciples had three questions: (1) When will these things be? (2) When will the Lord's coming be? (3) What are the signs of the consummation of the age? We cannot mix these three questions together. The Lord's answer was also in three separate sections. Concerning the first question, there are records in Mark and Luke, and these records are very detailed. But the scope in Matthew is wider. For this reason we need the supplement from Mark and Luke. The remaining two questions are not recorded in Mark and Luke, although some of the teachings are there. The direct goal of Luke's writing is not the rapture.</P><P>The first question is, "When will these things be?" What are "these things"? Since it says "these things," they must be plural. Aside from the destruction of the temple, there must be other things. After considering the background in chapter twenty-three (remember that the division of chapters and verses was not inspired by the Spirit), we know that there are six things: (1) The Israelites will fill up the measure of their fathers' evil (Matt. 23:32). (2) The Lord will send prophets and wise men and scribes (v. 34). Note that the prophets here are not the prophets in the Old Testament, because the Lord said that they would kill and crucify them; yet in the Old Testament, the cross was never used. (3) The Lord will avenge the evil things the Israelites did (vv. 35-36). (4) The temple will be destroyed (24:2). (5) All the house of Israel will look on the Lord's coming and say, "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord" (23:39). (6) The Lord will gather all of Israel like a hen gathers her brood under her wings (v. 37).</P><P>Since the disciples referred to these six things in their question, the Lord's answer must have six aspects. We can see this in chapter twenty-four: (1) Israel will fill up their fathers' evil (vv. 10-12). (2) "You" equals those sent by the Lord (v. 9). In the future the Lord will send more prophets. (3) The Lord will avenge, and there will be tribulation on the house of Israel (vv. 21-22). (4) The temple will be defiled and destroyed, just as prophesied by Daniel (v. 15). (5) "All the tribes of the land" (v. 30) refers to the twelve tribes of Israel. (6) The Lord will gather them (v. 31).</P>
