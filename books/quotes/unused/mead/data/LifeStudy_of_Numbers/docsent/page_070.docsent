   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Because of Jealousy</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One of the germs hidden within Miriam and Aaron was jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both Miriam and Aaron were older than Moses, with Miriam probably being the eldest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being older than Moses, in their heart they regarded themselves higher than Moses and were jealous of the greater respect that Moses received.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Miriam and Aaron said, "Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Has He not spoken through us also?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Num 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Miriam might have said, "I am a prophetess, one who speaks for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has spoken not only through Moses but also through me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the real issue here concerned the question of who had God's oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You may be used by God to speak for Him, but you may not have God's oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At Moses' time the oracle of God was with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the Pentateuch, God spoke to Moses many times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever Jehovah wanted something to be done, He first spoke about it to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, neither Aaron nor Miriam was God's spokesman; only one, Moses, had the oracle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The jealousy concerning this was the germ that caused the "sickness" in Numbers 12.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the generations, the germs of jealousy and rivalry regarding speaking for the Lord have existed among God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In speaking against Moses, Miriam and Aaron were speaking against the deputy authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Moses was younger than Miriam and Aaron, God had appointed him to be His deputy authority, His representative authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God had called Aaron and had raised up Miriam, but there is no hint that God charged them to be His representative.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But God told Moses clearly that He had chosen Him to be His representative authority on earth Exo 3:10-17; 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of Moses' timidity, God gave Aaron to Moses as his helper Exo 4:10-16; 6:30 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this does not mean that He appointed Aaron to be His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to God's governmental administration, Miriam and Aaron should have submitted themselves to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But they rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Taking Moses' Apparent Mistake</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>as an Excuse</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Miriam and Aaron took Moses' apparent mistake in marrying a Cushite woman as an excuse to speak against him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the fact was that they were competing with Moses in speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They were in rivalry with Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This, not the Cushite woman, was the real factor in their speaking against Moses.</S>
