   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Excelling of Love</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 13:8-13 Paul speaks concerning the excelling of love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 8 he declares, Love never falls away; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be done away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For love never to fall away means that it survives everything, holds its place forever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Love never fails, never fades out or comes to an end. It is like the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the gifts, whether prophecies, or tongues, or knowledge, are means for God s operation; they are not life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, they shall cease and be done away.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are all dispensational.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only life, which love expresses, is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the following verses, all gifts are for the immature child in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They will all be done away in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only love is of a mature man and will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we live and act by love, we have a foretaste of the next age and of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing can shake love or remove it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the other gifts, including prophecy, will eventually be done away with, but love remains.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It never falls away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the coming age there will be love, but there will be no tongues, interpretation, or prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both tongues, the most childish of the gifts, and prophecy, a more mature gift, will be done away.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verses 9 and 10 Paul continues, For we know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is complete comes, that which is in part shall be done away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this age we know and prophesy only in part, not in full.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word when in verse 10 refers to the next age, the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word complete also means mature, in contrast with childish in the following verse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, that which is in part refers to such things as prophecies and knowledge, as mentioned in verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 11 says, When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this age the believers are children, having the childish gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word child here means an immature one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To reason as a child is to take account of things as a child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the next age the mature believers will become men, and all the childish gifts, especially the least ones, tongue-speaking and its interpretation, will be done away.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, we can have a foretaste of the next age by living a life of love in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Love matures us in life; gifts keep us in childhood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 12 Paul goes on to say, For now we see by means of a mirror obscurely, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I shall fully know as also I was fully known.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word now refers to this age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning the expression by means of a mirror obscurely, J. N. Darby says in his New Translation, That is, through some medium which, in degree, hinders vision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word means also a mirror, but it is used for window, made, not of clear transparent glass, as now, but of semi-transparent materials.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word then in verse 12 refers to the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 13 Paul concludes, But now abide faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word but here indicates a contrast between verse 13 and the preceding verses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faith receives the divine things John 1:12 and realizes the spiritual and unseen things Heb 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hope reaps and partakes of the things realized by faith Rom 8:24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Love enjoys the things received and realized by faith and partaken of by hope for nourishing ourselves, building up others 1 Cor 8:1 , and expressing God, thus fulfilling the entire law Rom 13:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Such a love causes us to grow in life for the development and use of the spiritual gifts, and is the excellent way to have the greater gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, it is the greatest of the three abiding virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>So we must pursue it 1 Cor 14:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Love cares for the Body and builds up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First love unites the Body and then builds it up.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we focus our attention on the love which builds up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should pursue love and remain in the Body to enjoy the Spirit.</S>
