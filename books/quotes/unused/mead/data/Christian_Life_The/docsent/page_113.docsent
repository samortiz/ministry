   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Christian life is a suffering life because we must do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the one hand, to do the will of God concerning our relationship with God is food to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In John 4:34 the Lord Jesus said, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, to do the will of God is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second reason for Christ's death is that He had to deny His human life in order to live by the Father's life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Like us, the Lord Jesus had a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He was on the earth He did not live by His human life; rather, He denied His human life to live by the Father's divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we are people who do God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, like the Lord Jesus, we are people who do not live by our own life but by God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This too is a real suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In every situation related to our daily living, we need to ask ourselves whether we are living by the divine life or by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do this, quite often we will realize that we are living by our natural life, our self.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At such times we need to go to the cross Luke 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To go to the cross is to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even while eating our meals we need to be conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At times we may be tempted to complain about the kind or quantity of food that we are given to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, to complain is to live by the self, not by God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are those who have been chosen, called, and sanctified by God to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Doing the will of God is altogether a suffering to our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, we are those who have been saved, regenerated, and separated to live not by our natural life but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a matter of whether we are doing something right or wrong; that is not the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The issue is, by what life are we doing it, by our natural life or by the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To deny our natural life is a suffering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every day and in every matter we struggle and fight with others to get what we desire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We like to do things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To do something not by our life but by the life of another is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the Christian life.</S>
