<H1 CLASS=TITLE>A PERSONAL LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 12</H2><P>To the brothers and sisters who have received the same heavenly calling in the Lord Jesus:</P><P>I have not met with all of you here for over a year. I believe that from other sources as well as through this magazine you all know that I have been ill. Indeed, since 1926, my body has daily grown weaker. I have been ill time after time, and in addition, I have suffered from lack of rest due to the many responsibilities which are still upon me. My health has been increasingly deteriorating. The writing of The Spiritual Man exhausted my strength, and since completing its writing, I have suffered continual illness even up till now.</P><P>I feel very sorry about one thing: During the past two years, I could not answer your letters on time. Some of them I have not been able to answer at all. Although one or two brothers and sisters have answered on my behalf during my illness, we have still missed many letters. I have to ask for your understanding in this. You are aware that normally I am busy enough. With my sickness, I became even weaker. I hope that you will not be offended by this.</P><P>I feel very grateful concerning this one thing: While I was perplexed on every side, a number of brothers and sisters in the Lord came to help me in my trouble. At the resurrection of the just, may the Lord reward them richly. Many brothers and sisters are aware that I do not have a constant livelihood. So for the Lord's sake, from the north and from the south, they deprived themselves, generously and voluntarily supplying me with abundant gifts, that I need not be anxious during my illness concerning my lack. Their excellent kindness and favor toward me have been overflowing. Surely I am not worthy. I am one of the most useless servants of the Lord. I quote Paul's words: "You sent both once and again to my need...I seek the fruit which increases to your account." My only prayer is that your kindness toward me would not be for nothing. I hope that when I am up again, I may be able to accomplish a small portion of my work in God's enterprise. Besides their financial supply, many brothers and sisters have written to show me their concern, and I express my thanks. I say to all who have ministered to me in such a way: Please accept my grateful, heartfelt thanks.</P><P>Of course, what I have experienced during my illness is most profitable. From the very beginning I prayed that I would gain from this illness what I needed, for I am not willing to be ill for nothing. As I look back over the past year, I can gratefully say that God's treatment is just right; not one single day could be omitted. Many of these experiences cannot be made public, but I fully believe that they are for my personal enrichment and for your gain as well.</P><P>Now, through God's unlimited and inexhaustible grace and through your ceaseless prayers, once again I have returned from the gate of death. I look to the Lord that in a time convenient to Him He would bring me to complete recovery. At present I rest and at the same time work. I now present myself once more to God to accomplish His will and to serve His saints. Many things concerning my personal future may have to change. There may need to be a change in direction concerning the literature work, the local work, and the work in other provinces. My co-workers and I are seeking before the Lord. We desire to have deeper obedience under greater light. When "the pattern on the mount" is clear, very clear, we will inform you as well. Since our conference last February, many have asked about the time for our next conference and would like to join us for such a conference. At present we cannot say anything. We will wait until the Lord's will becomes apparent.</P><P>Beloved brothers, the time of the Lord's coming back is fast approaching. We must be faithful. In the days ahead we may suffer more misunderstanding and more severe opposition; but since we have been destined for this, we should remain faithful. The apostate ones will increase, so will the backsliding ones. Darkness will increase, and we will encounter more evil treatment. But all these things only show that the Lord is near. During these days, God has said, "Let him who does unrighteousness do unrighteousness still; and let him who is filthy be filthy still; and let him who is righteous do righteousness still; and let him who is holy be holy still" (Rev. 22:11). Brothers, please continue to remember me in your prayers so that in all my afflictions I may be able to stand fast, faithfully bearing a good testimony for the Lord.</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Just a few more miles beloved;<br>And our feet shall ache no more;<br>No more sin, and no more sorrow;<br>Hush thee, Jesus went before;<br>And I hear Him sweetly whispering,<br>"Faint not, fear not, still press on;<br>For it may be ere tomorrow;<br>The long journey will be done.</P><P>The peace of the Lord be with you.</P><P>A servant of Christ,<br>Watchman Nee<br>December 1929</P>
