<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 13:1-38</h1><h2 class=head1>THE IMPORTANCE OF CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2><p>With this message we come to chapter thirteen of the Gospel of John. It may seem to us that what is recorded in this chapter is not of great importance. Actually, this chapter is crucial, for it is a link that connects chapters one through twelve with chapters fourteen through twenty-one.<h2 class=head2>A Brief Sketch</h2><p>Chapters one and two of John’s Gospel give us a brief sketch of the entire book. Chapter one may be considered a prologue to the Gospel of John. Then in chapter two we see that the principle of life is to change death into life (2:1-11) and that the goal of life is to raise up the house of God that had been destroyed and enlarge it into the mysterious and mystical Body of Christ (2:12-22). Hence, in these two chapters we have the prologue to the entire Gospel, and we see the principle and goal of life.<h2 class=head2>Nine Cases</h2><p>In chapters three through eleven we have nine cases. These cases indicate that all of our needs have been met by the One who came that we may have life (10:10). The first case, that of Nicodemus, is a case of regeneration, and the last case, that of Lazarus, is a case of resurrection. Regeneration is actually the first step of resurrection. These nine cases depict one complete person who is in the new creation, a person who has gone from regeneration to resurrection.<h2 class=head2>The Way for the Church to Be Enlarged</h2><p>In chapter twelve we see that these nine cases result in a house at Bethany, which represents the church life in miniature. This indicates that out of the nine cases the church life is produced. However, the church life in John 12 is too small. In quality it is adequate, but in quantity it is too limited. With the miniature of the church life in Bethany we see service with Martha, love with Mary, and the testimony with Lazarus. Through the testimony of the resurrected Lazarus, many people were drawn to the Lord Jesus.<p>In chapter twelve of John a large crowd was drawn to the Lord (v. 18). However, He told His disciples that He was not willing to accept exaltation from the crowd. The Lord Jesus knew that exaltation cannot multiply the church life. The church life can be multiplied only through death and resurrection. Therefore, the Lord refused to take the opportunity to be exalted. Rather, as a grain of wheat, He said that He would fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains for the enlargement of the church life: “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit” (v. 24).<p>The Lord’s death was also for His glorification and for the glorification of the Father. This was the reason the Lord said, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified” (v. 23). It was also the reason He prayed, “Father, glorify Your name” (v. 28).<p>Furthermore, the Lord’s death was the judgment of the world and its ruler, Satan: “Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out” (v. 31).<p>Regarding His death, the Lord went on to say, “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself” (v. 32). This reveals that through His death many would be drawn to the Lord in order to be regenerated and resurrected into the church life. It is in this way that the church is enlarged.
