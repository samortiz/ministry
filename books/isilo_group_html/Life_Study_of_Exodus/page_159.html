AMALEK VERSUS KINGSHIP</h2><p>The second picture of the flesh is that of Amalek in the book of Exodus. In this picture we see how to deal with the flesh, a subject we covered in the foregoing message. If we would deal with the flesh, typified by Amalek, we must be identified with the interceding Christ in the heavens and join ourselves to the fighting Spirit within us. In this message we need to see that the flesh is not only versus grace, but that it is also versus kingship. For this reason, the flesh must be thoroughly dealt with before the kingdom of God can come. Where the flesh is, there can be no kingdom of God. Only when the flesh is dealt with is it possible for the kingdom to come.</p><p>In Romans 8:7 Paul says that it is not possible for the flesh to be subject to God. The kingdom of God denotes the authority of God by which all things are made subject to God. But it is not possible for the flesh to be subject to God. It is utterly opposed to God&rsquo;s throne.</p><h2 class="head2">A. A Hand against the Throne of Jehovah</h2><p>In Exodus 17:16 we see that Amalek is a hand against the throne of Jehovah. In the eyes of God, Amalek was considered a hand against God&rsquo;s throne. This indicates that Amalek tried to overthrow God&rsquo;s throne, just as Satan once tried to do. Exodus 17:16 says that because there is such a hand against the throne of Jehovah, God will have war with Amalek from generation to generation (Heb.). By this we see that Amalek is versus God&rsquo;s authority.</p><p>Every aspect of our flesh, whether good or evil, is an enemy of God&rsquo;s authority. The flesh does not care for God or for His authority. Whenever we are in the flesh, we regard ourselves as individuals who are not obligated to submit to God&rsquo;s throne. We think that we have a position and rights of our own. Such a rebellious attitude has its source in Satan. Satan, however, is one with our flesh. Satan&rsquo;s principle is not to come to us directly, but to come through others or through something in ourselves. For example, Satan came to Eve in the form of a serpent. In Matthew 16, Peter, a disciple who loved the Lord Jesus very much, was utilized by Satan. Satan came to the Lord in Peter and through him. Often our flesh serves as a cloak for Satan. Whenever we exercise our flesh, Satan is hidden within us. Therefore, like Satan himself, the flesh is against God&rsquo;s authority. According to the portrait in Exodus 17, Amalek is a hand against the throne of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Hur of the Tribe of Judah<br />Staying Up Moses&rsquo; Praying Hand against Amalek</h2><p>When Moses&rsquo; praying hand became heavy, there was the need of the support by the priesthood, represented by Aaron, and by the kingship, represented by Hur, who was of the tribe of Judah. Because Amalek is a hand against God&rsquo;s throne, there is the need for the praying hand to be supported by the kingship in the warfare against Amalek. The kingship is a support to our prayer life. If we are not under God&rsquo;s authority, but are rebellious, our prayer life is finished. But the more we are subject to God and His authority, the greater will be our desire to pray. When we rebel against God and reject His authority, our appetite for prayer disappears. Suppose concerning a certain matter you disobey the inner anointing. As a result, for a period of time, perhaps several days, you have no desire to pray. Thus, it is crucial for us to learn to honor God&rsquo;s kingship, to honor God&rsquo;s authority. Our attitude should be to say, &ldquo;Lord, I don&rsquo;t want to do anything without You. I need You as my grace. The flesh is simply myself doing things apart from You. I don&rsquo;t want to live without You as my grace.&rdquo; We all need to pray with such a spirit.</p><p>We should also pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me to honor Your authority, Your kingship, and to always be subject to You. Lord, You have the authority. I need to obey You and be subject to You.&rdquo; If we maintain such an attitude, our appetite and desire to pray will increase. If, for example, we are led of the Lord to go shopping, we shall be filled with prayer as we go shopping. Whereas rebellion kills our appetite for prayer, obedience increases the desire for prayer.</p><p>Because Amalek is involved with God&rsquo;s kingdom, we need the support of both the priesthood and the kingship in order to fight against Amalek. If we try to deal with the flesh without caring for God&rsquo;s authority, we are wrong. In principle, we ourselves are against God&rsquo;s kingdom. We need the support of the kingship, of Hur, in our prayer life. Continually we should look to the Lord for grace to be subject to His authority. In this way we honor God&rsquo;s authority and strengthen the kingship in our experience.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_158.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_160.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Exodus &nbsp; pg 159</div><br></body></html>
