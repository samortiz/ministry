[3]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS AN INTRODUCTORY WORD THE VITAL GROUPS AND THE OVERCOMERS Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9; Eph 1:23; Gen 3:24; 6:3a, 17; 19:24-25; 12:7; Exo 3:8a; Num 14; Josh 13:1-7; Judg.
[4]  2:11-15; Matt 21:43; John 3:16; 1 Cor 1:9; Eph 1:23; 3:19b; Gal 1:6; 4:9; Matt 13:33; Col 2:20-21; John 15:2a; Rev 5:6; Phil 1:19b; Eph 4:12-13; Rev 2:7b; 3:12; 2 Tim 2:12a; Rev 20:4, 6; Matt 25:21, 23, 30; 24:51a OUTLINE God's move on the earth for the accomplishment of His eternal economy: Through the Adamic race: With the tree of life as the center and the goal Gen 2:9.
[5]  In this series of messages, we want to speak concerning the vital groups.
[6]  In order to see the importance of the vital groups, we need a clear view of the entire Bible.
[7]  The first crucial point of the major items of the Lord's recovery is the participation in the processed Triune God.
[8]  We need to participate in, to partake of, to enjoy, the very Triune God who has gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.
[9]  These are the processes of the Triune God, and today we enjoy Him according to what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 13:14: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."
[10]  God's Intention a. To Consummate the Building Up of the Body of Christ
[11]  The overcomers of the Lord should pay full attention to the building up of the Body of Christ.
[12]  According to Matthew 25, the Lord has given each one of us at least one talent of money for us to deposit with the money changers so that we can make some interest v. 27 . The money changers are the sinners and the young ones whom we perfect to grow in Christ.
[13]  Matthew 25 tells us that the Lord will come back and ask us to give Him an account v. 19 . We do not want to be the evil and slothful slaves who are rebuked by the Lord.
[14]  Once we contact sinners and make them the members of Christ, they become young babes in Christ.
[15]  All of those in that corporate man-child overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul-life unto death v. 11 . Second, there are the living overcomers, the 144,000 raptured to the third heaven to stand with the Lord on Mount Zion Rev 14:1 . They follow Christ wherever He goes v. 4 . They are the overcomers living up to the time before the tribulation.
[16]  Still the Lord says to them, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne" v. 21 . Regardless of the condition of a local church, as long as it is set up on the proper ground of oneness, it is still the church.
[17]  Eventually, God's judgment will be applied to all the believers at the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 . a. The Reward of the Full Enjoyment of Christ in the Kingdom
[18]  The degradation of the church: The church in general: Having left her first love for the Lord Rev 2:4.
[19]  In this message we want to see how to be vitalized.
[20]  In this life we have been saved, we are being saved, and we are to be saved to the extent that we can even reign as kings in this life.
[21]  They are neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, and because of this the Lord says that He is about to spew them out of His mouth Rev 3:15-16 . b.
[22]  These points are the participation in the processed Triune God, the rich enjoyment of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, the full experience of the consummated, compound Spirit, the absolute living by the eternal life, the building up of the Body of Christ, the practice of the churches on the local ground, and the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ.
[23]  The practice of the local churches is on the local ground in the oneness of the unique Body of Christ by four steps. a. Saving Sinners to Be the Members of Christ
[24]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWO THE THREE ENEMIES TODAY Scripture Reading: Rev 3:1-2; Rom 12:1-10; Rev 3:14-18, 20; Rom 12:11; John 15:2a; Matt 25:24-30 OUTLINE The deadness of Sardis Rev 3:1-2: To be conquered in the Body life Rom 12:3-10.
[25]  By: Presenting our bodies a living sacrifice to God Rom 12:1.
[26]  We saw in the previous message that the way to be vitalized is to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers, to make a thorough confession to the Lord, to have close, intimate, and thorough fellowship with the Lord and with the seeking saints, and to reconsecrate yourself to the Lord.
[27]  In this message we want to see three particular enemies which we have today.
[28]  This is why we feel desperate that we need to look to the Lord for Him to vitalize us.
[29]  We may feel there is nothing wrong with us, but based upon the fact that we have not borne fruit, we must realize that something is wrong with our enjoyment of Christ.
[30]  We may think that we have seen a number of saints who have not borne fruit for quite a long time, but we did not notice that they were cut off from the enjoyment of the Lord.
[31]  I. THE DEADNESS OF SARDIS A. To Be Conquered in the Body Life
[32]  If you are not living in the Body, you are through.
[33]  We may say that we have already offered ourselves to the Lord, but we need to repeat our consecration every day and even many times throughout the day.
[34]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE THREE HOW TO START YOUR VITAL GROUP Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:16-27; Rom 1:14-15 OUTLINE By fellowshipping with your companion through desperate prayers for the Lord's blessing.
[35]  To start from the first step of the God-ordained way to get sinners saved to make them the members of the Body of Christ.
[36]  I. BY FELLOWSHIPPING WITH YOUR COMPANION THROUGH DESPERATE PRAYERS FOR THE LORD'S BLESSING
[37]  In this message we want to fellowship about how to start your vital group.
[38]  If the Lord has mercy upon us and we would receive His mercy, our vital group will do well, and after six to nine months, we should split our group to have a new start.
[39]  V. TO ALSO KEEP YOURSELF OPEN TO THE LORD FOR HIS LEADING TO VISIT PEOPLE OTHER THAN YOUR ACQUAINTANCES
[40]  So you should keep yourself open to the Lord for His new leading to visit new people other than your acquaintances.
[41]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE FOUR WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF YOUR VITAL GROUP TODAY?
[42]  Scripture Reading: Matt 25:4; 2 Tim 1:6 OUTLINE Have you started your vital group?
[43]  In the preaching of the gospel, we need to get people convicted and subdued.
[44]  The ones who get saved should have the sensation and realization that they are sinful and need the Lord's forgiveness.
[45]  When an unbeliever prays with sincerity, "Oh, Lord, I am sinful," this means he is being touched by the Lord.
[46]  The way to be vitalized is to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers.
[47]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE FIVE THE NEED FOR A NEW GENERATION BEING BROUGHT OUT OF EVERYTHING THAT IS ROUTINE
[48]  In this series of messages, I have the burden to help us get out of all kinds of formality and routine.
[49]  We hate any kind of form; we hate formal meetings; we hate rituals; we hate routine meetings, routine prayer, routine speaking, routine reading, routine sharing, and routine prophesying.
[50]  We want to be vitalized overcomers in the church life who are one with the Lord to conquer deadness, lukewarmness, and barrenness.
[51]  When we visit new persons, they will wonder who we are and what we believe in. We can give them the tract entitled Our Faith to show them what we believe.
[52]  God, Christ, the Spirit, and the eternal life are for producing the Body of Christ, the Body of Christ is expressed in local churches, and all the local churches should keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.
[53]  Now I would like to ask, "What is a vital group?"
[54]  You may say that a vital group is a group that is living, burning, and bearing fruit.
[55]  In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul said that we should all desire to prophesy, to speak for the Lord v. 1 . Paul told us that we can all prophesy v. 31 . To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 means to speak for the Lord and to speak forth Christ.
[56]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SIX BUILDING UP A HABIT OF CONTACTING PEOPLE Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 9:16-27; 1 Tim 1:16 OUR BURDEN IN PREACHING THE GOSPEL
[57]  Paul said, "For if I preach the gospel, I have no boast, for necessity is laid upon me; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.
[58]  Verse 24 says, "Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize?
[59]  In verse 25 Paul said, "And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; they then, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible."
[60]  If you are disciplined, coached to contend, you must learn how to exercise self-control in everything in drinking, in eating, in dressing, in combing your hair, in putting on your tie, and even in your laughing or weeping.
[61]  We may wonder how we could ever compare to the apostle Paul.
[62]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SEVEN THE NEED IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY TODAY TO BUILD UP THE HABIT OF CONTACTING PEOPLE Scripture Reading: John 21:15-17; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:1-2; S. S. 1:8 THE NEED FOR SHEPHERDS IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY
[63]  We have to build up a habit of contacting people.
[64]  In Song of Songs 1:8 the Lord said to His follower, "Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents."
[65]  This verse indicates that we have to run after the Lord.
[66]  After the Lord asked him this the third time, Peter could only say, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You" v. 17 . After each of Peter's three responses, the Lord told him, "Feed My lambs.
[67]  In the past we may have thought that we need to shepherd people's spirits.
[68]  We stress the spirit of man, and we tell people to reject the soul.
[69]  This is why I encourage you all to open up yourself to your fellow brothers so that the Lord can have a way to shepherd your soul.
[70]  If we are hot for the Lord to the extent that we are burning, we will pick up the burden to contact people.
[71]  You may think that you do not know that many people, but when you make a list, you may find out that you have over a hundred people whom you know.
[72]  First, we must pick up the burden and make a definite resolution to contact people.
[73]  We need to be adjusted by the Lord in the way that we talk and in our gestures so that we can reach people.
[74]  Eventually, you can let him know that you are a Christian, not a preacher, and that you love the Lord Jesus.
[75]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE EIGHT AWAKE, SLEEPER, AND ARISE FROM THE DEAD, AND CHRIST WILL SHINE ON YOU Scripture Reading: Eph 5:14
[76]  Even though we have released a number of messages concerning the practice of the vital groups, my burden has not yet been discharged.
[77]  We may feel okay about what we have shared and what we have heard, but the speaking Spirit says, "No, the burden is still not discharged."
[78]  I have said that you have to get a companion.
[79]  But you should not go to get a companion before going to the Lord.
[80]  You must have a start by going to the Lord until He enlightens you, until He shines on you.
[81]  Then you will fully realize where you are and what you are.
[82]  While you are saying you are dead, the Lord will say, "You are dead because you are sinful.
[83]  The Lord will shine on you and show you that you are like a person buried under the earth with layer upon layer of dirt.
[84]  You have to get out of that by making a thorough and detailed confession to the Lord so that you can be forgiven, washed, and released to emerge from the depths of your fall.
[85]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE NINE HAVING A LITTLE POWER AND HAVING CONSTANT CONTACTS WITH PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Rev 3:7-8 "YOU HAVE A LITTLE POWER"
[86]  Recently I have been wondering before the Lord why our start with the vital groups seems to be so slow.
[87]  Most of us love the Lord and are seeking after Him in this age.
[88]  As I was considering this matter before the Lord, He reminded me of Revelation 3:7-8.
[89]  These verses say, "And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens: I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name."
[90]  SOME POINTS TO HELP US GO ON WITH THE LORD
[91]  I would like us to take note of a few points to help us go on with the Lord:
[92]  We are used to analyzing, to lingering, and to doubting about what we have experienced, and we would not forget about what we have experienced and be brought on to maturity, to perfection.
[93]  You should try your best to always keep four or five new ones under your care.
[94]  If you do have four or five, you do not need to be in that much of a hurry to contact others.
[95]  The Lord then said, "What do you want Me to do for you?" v. 41 . This blind man did not pray in the natural way that we do.
[96]  If we know someone is not clear that the Lord is his Savior, we can send him Christ the Savior, a tract concerning Christ's status as the Lamb of God John 1:29 , the bronze serpent 3:14-15 , and the grain of wheat 12:24 .
[97]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TEN OUR NEED TO RISE UP AND TAKE ACTION Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:3; 1 Cor 15:58
[98]  In this message I want to point out two verses from the Scripture for our encouragement to go on in the vital groups.
[99]  Then 1 Corinthians 15:58 charges us to be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.
[100]  But we have to learn that after we seek the Lord for some time by contacting Him, repenting to Him, confessing our shortcomings to Him, and abiding in the fellowship with Him and with His children, we are ready to take action.
[101]  We should learn that when we wake up and rise up to labor in the Lord, Satan will try to frustrate us, so we should not trust in our feelings.
[102]  Some may think that when they become a servant of the Lord, everything will be wonderful.
[103]  You may say, "I don't know whom the Lord wants me to contact; I prayed about some people, but it seems not one is ready for me to contact."
[104]  The only thing is this: when you take action, you should not do anything by trusting in yourself.
[105]  You should not think that I can do something in the Lord but you cannot.
[106]  CONTACTING PEOPLE IN A SPIRIT OF PRAYER WITH ENDURANCE
[107]  I realize that we all are busy and do not have that much time.
[108]  You may not have much opportunity to separate time to pray to the Lord.
[109]  But even while you are driving to work, you can pray, "Lord, I don't know whom I should contact today.
[110]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE ELEVEN ABIDING IN THE LORD AND WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT TO FLOW RIVERS OF LIVING WATER Scripture Reading: John 15:5; 7:38-39; Rom 8:4b; Acts 4:31; 1 Thes 5:17-19 OUTLINE Abiding in the Lord John 15:5.
[111]  In John 15 the Lord Jesus unveiled God's economy in this universe in a very simple way, in the way of a parable concerning the vine tree, the true vine.
[112]  In this message my burden is to show us that in this parable the Lord points out what our status is.
[113]  To be a Christian, a believer in Christ, and to be a follower of Christ, what kind of persons should we be?
[114]  The Lord says that our status in Him is to be a branch of Him, a part of Him to branch Him out v. 5 .
[115]  The only distinction between Him and us is this: He needs us to branch Him out, and we need Him to be our supply and to be our everything.
[116]  If we are apart from Him, we have lost our status, we have annulled our function, and we can do nothing.
[117]  But we have to admit and confess that we do not live a life like a branch of the vine tree to abide in Him all the time that we may flow Him out, branch Him out, to have an issue in bearing fruit.
[118]  Our walking according to the spirit will spontaneously have an issue, and that issue is to flow out Christ to bear fruit, and to bear fruit is to transmit Christ into others.
[119]  According to the revelation given to us in the New Testament, a person who abides in Christ, who walks according to the spirit, always flows by speaking.
[120]  If from the first day of the year to the last day of the year you never speak to anybody concerning Christ, you do not flow Him.
[121]  Regardless of how much you feel you are enjoying Christ, participating in His riches, the flow of life within you has been stopped.
[122]  When we are filled with the Spirit, we are full of Christ, and our uttering organ will be open to speak forth Christ.
[123]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWELVE THE LABOR OF LOVE Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:3; Col 1:28-29; 2:1; 1 Cor 3:8; 15:10, 58 OUTLINE The vital group should press on according to the apostle Paul's prayer in 1 Thessalonians 1:3: Concerning the work of faith.
[124]  Prayer: Thank You, Lord, that You are altogether what we need.
[125]  Tonight, at this moment, we need You to cleanse us with Your precious blood.
[126]  In 1 Thessalonians 1:3 the apostle Paul wrote, "Remembering unceasingly your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father."
[127]  THE INCREASE OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY IN NEW ZEALAND THROUGH THE SAINTS' LABORING
[128]  After visiting me for a number of months, at the end of the year, in December, he told me, "Mr. Lee, I will not come again until after the new year, because you have many things to do." He stopped coming, but on New Year's Day, I do not know why I had a thought to go to church, but I went.
[129]  Our visiting people is a preparation for the Holy Spirit to sanctify them.
[130]  OUR VISITING PEOPLE BEING A RESPONSE TO CHRIST'S TRANSCENDING
[131]  No one in Hades, on the earth, in the air, or even in the third heaven can defeat the Lord Jesus.
[132]  On the day of Pentecost the church was formed not by the crucified Christ nor the resurrected Christ, but by the transcending Christ who passed through and surpassed the power of darkness in Hades, the opposition on earth, the rulers and authorities in the air, and even God's abode in the third heaven.
[133]  THE TRAINING AND THE PRACTICE OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE THIRTEEN HAVING ENTERED THROUGH THE NARROW GATE AND WALKING ON THE CONSTRICTED WAY Scripture Reading: Matt 7:13-14 OUTLINE In the decree of the kingdom's constitution, Christ displayed the two possible ways of people's life and work before God Matt 7:13-14: The broad way: Through the wide gate.
[134]  We remember, Lord, that this is not our recovery but Yours.
[135]  Lord, we have fully experienced and realize that we are nothing.
[136]  BEING REGULATED ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF LIFE IN ORDER TO BE HEALTHY, NORMAL, VITAL BELIEVERS
[137]  If we are not well regulated, we can never be living and vital.
[138]  If you ask a healthy person why he is healthy, he will tell you that it is because he takes care of the principles of life.
[139]  We might think that the apostle Paul would bring thousands to the Lord, but we can see in Paul's history that this was not the case.
[140]  In Colossians 1:28-29 Paul said that he labored to announce Christ, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that he might present every man full-grown in Christ.
