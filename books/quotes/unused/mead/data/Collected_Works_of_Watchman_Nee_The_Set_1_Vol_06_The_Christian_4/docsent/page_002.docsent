   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a very important question!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Salvation or perdition depends on whether or not you are at peace with God.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fighting against heaven is not the meaning of being at enmity with God; you do not have to fight against heaven to be at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you walk according to the flesh and ignore God's demand, caring only for living in your lusts, you are at enmity with God.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Can you keep His law?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How many times have you walked according to your flesh and the lusts of your flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How mild is the expression "the mind set on"!</S>
