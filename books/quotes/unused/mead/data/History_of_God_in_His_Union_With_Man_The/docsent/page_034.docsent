   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We want to continue to see God's history in time in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in time God worked to restore the judged universe and create man Gen 1:2 2:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then He saved man from his fall Gen 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will see how God worked on His saints from Abel to Noah and judged the world from Cain to Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The record of this history is from Genesis 4 through the first part of Genesis 11.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This portion of the Word is only about seven and a half chapters, but all of the items recorded in this short part of the holy Word are very, very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My burden is to help us to know, to realize, to enter into, and to experience the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, this line on the history of God in His union with man is still on the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not know what God did with Abel, with Seth, with Enosh, with Enoch, with Methuselah, and with Noah, we still do not know what the Christian life is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All of these persons lived the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may ask, "Was Abel a Christian?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was not a Christian, but the life he lived was a Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His life was a model, a type, of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abel was a shepherd of sheep, and sheep at Abel's time were used for sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were not used for food because at that time, God had not ordained that people eat animal meat Gen 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was not until after the flood that God said that man could eat meat Gen 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sheep at Abel's time were not for food but for offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Have you ever realized that the first full-time co-worker was Abel?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He raised up sacrifices for God's offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was his job, his work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was also his kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abel was a person doing nothing on this earth but offering to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Genesis 4:4 says that God had respect unto Abel and his offering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How good it was that Abel was a full-timer doing nothing but living for God!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was not in the line of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was in the line of the tree of life, living for God and living to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those of us who are serving the Lord full time should compare our full-time service with Abel's. When we compare ourselves with Abel, we probably need to say that we are part-timers, not full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abel was living a life that was absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His living was for God, not for food, for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His elder brother Cain was the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Cain was living for his daily necessity, for food.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Abel lived on God in a spiritual sense, and he lived on what God did, on what God provided, in a physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are full-timers we should live as Abel did.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not live on anything worked out by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Cain was different from Abel because he lived on what he did.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was a farmer producing food for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, we can see that it is not too much to say that Abel lived a Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we live the Christian life merely according to what the New Testament teaches, that is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to come back to the Old Testament to see the first typical full-timer for God Abel.</S>
