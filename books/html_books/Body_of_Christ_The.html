In this chapter we want to see that the church as the Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FATHER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Choosing Us in Christ</H2><P>Ephesians 1 shows us that for God's purpose of gaining a Body for Christ, He chose us in eternity past. The purpose of His choosing us in Christ was that we would be holy and without blemish (vv. 3-4). To be holy according to the New Testament is not to be perfect, to be good, or to be right. To be holy is to have the divine, holy nature of God permeate and saturate our entire being to make our entire being as holy as God is. To have God's holy nature wrought into us that we may be holy in nature like God is a matter of dispensing. God has dispensed Himself into our being so that we can have His holy nature. This holy nature has become ours to saturate our entire being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Predestinating Us unto Sonship</H2><P>Within the matter of God's choosing, He has also predestinated us unto sonship through Christ to Himself (vv. 5-6). "Unto sonship" simply means to be born of God as God's sons to have God's life. In God's choosing and predestinating, we can see how God intended to have His nature wrought into us that we may be holy and to have His life born into us that we may become His sons. God's choosing and predestinating indicate one thing&#151;God's desire is to dispense Himself into our being that we may have His nature and life. Eventually, as His sons, we will fully express Him in His eternal holiness. This is the issue of God the Father's dispensing of the divine element into our being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SON</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Redeeming Us through His Blood</H2><P>Ephesians 1 also shows us that following the Father's choosing and predestinating us, the Son, Christ, came to redeem us. In Christ's redemption there is not only His redeeming us out of our sin. Christ's death for our redemption also released the divine life out from Him, and in His resurrection He has imparted Himself into us as our very life, which is the life of God. Thus, in Christ's redemption He has taken away our sin and sins and has also imparted Himself into our very being as the divine life for us to live a life of the sons of God. We were "sick" in sin, in sins, and in death. We were dead persons (Eph. 2:1), but Christ in His redemption has healed us of all sicknesses that we might be brought back to Him and to His headship. Before we were saved, we were not under the proper headship. But through Christ's redemption we were healed, and in His salvation we were brought back to Christ's headship for the purpose of God heading up all things in Christ for the accomplishment of His eternal economy (Eph. 1:7-10). God has an eternal economy to have all the things created by Him headed up in Christ. This heading up could only be accomplished if we as the church were redeemed, healed, and brought back to Christ. His redemption also implies the dispensing of Himself into our being. In His death and resurrection, Christ has imparted Himself into our being that we may have His divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Making Us an Inheritance of God</H2><P>When He redeemed us, He also made us an inheritance of God for God's enjoyment (vv. 11-12). We are one with Christ in His divine life to be God's inheritance so that God can enjoy us as His enjoyment. This is the result of the dispensing of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Sealing Us as God's Inheritance</H2><P>Ephesians 1 goes on to tell us that the Holy Spirit sealed us as God's inheritance for His enjoyment (v. 13). The Holy Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. God the Father is embodied in God the Son (John 14:10; Col. 2:9), and God the Son is realized as God the Spirit (John 14:16-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). The Spirit of God is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us to dispense all that God is and has into our being. To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. When a piece of paper is sealed with ink, the seal, the ink, and the paper all become one. The ink in the form of the seal will be absorbed by the paper, and they will be mingled and blended together as one entity. The paper is now a sealed paper, a paper with a seal. Before we received the Lord, we were blank sheets of paper. After Christ's redemption, we were cleansed and the consummated Spirit of God came to seal us with the very element and essence of the Triune God as the ink. Now in this universe there is a group of people who have been sealed by the consummated Spirit of the Triune God. We sealed ones are one entity with the entire Triune God. This is the dispensing of the divine Trinity in all the divine elements into God's chosen people redeemed by Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being a Pledge to Us of God as Our Inheritance</H2><P>The sealing Spirit is also a pledge to us of God as our inheritance for our enjoyment (Eph. 1:14). God has not only gained us, acquired us, as an inheritance, but He has also given Himself to us as our possession, as our inheritance, for our enjoyment. On the one hand, we are God's acquired possession, God's inheritance, for His enjoyment. On the other hand, God is a possession to us as our inheritance for our enjoyment. Again, this shows us that we redeemed ones and the Triune God, the redeeming One, become one entity through His divine dispensing of His divine essence and element into our very being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ISSUE OF THE DISPENSING<br>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</H2><P>The issue that flows out of the dispensing of the divine Trinity is the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:17-23). The unique God is triune&#151;God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. The divine Person, the Triune God, has dispensed Himself as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit into all God's chosen and redeemed people, making them an issue out of His very essence, His very element. The issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity is the church as the Body of Christ. The dispensing Triune God becomes the Head, and the issue that comes out of His dispensing becomes the Body. This is a great, universal Man. The Head of this Man is the Triune God, the dispensing One, and the Body of this Man is His issue, the issue of the dispensing God. The church is the Body of the dispensing Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Called into a Hope without Limitation</H2><P>We, the chosen ones of God the Father, have been called into a hope without limitation&#151;the Triune God as the unlimited hope to us (v. 18b). The unbelievers do not have any hope, but we, God's chosen ones, have an unlimited hope. This hope is the unlimited God Himself. We are hoping for what God has promised to give us, which is He Himself. His unlimited self has been given to us as the unlimited hope, into which we, God's chosen ones, have been called. We are living in America, and we may say that we have been called into America to explore the riches of America for our enjoyment. Likewise, we have been called by the Triune God into the Triune God. We have to declare that we are now in the Triune God, but the Triune God is unsearchably rich. We have only enjoyed Him to a small extent. There is a vast territory of His riches to be possessed. We have not exhausted Him. We have been called into the vast territory of the Triune God. We are in the Triune God as our hope and we are exploring Him as our hope.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having Been Made His Inheritance</H2><P>We, the predestinated ones of God the Father, have been made His inheritance with the glory of His riches&#151;the very Triune God expressed in the riches of all that He is (v. 18c). God has given Himself to us as an inheritance in hope. He has also made us His inheritance with the glory of His riches. The hope into which we have been called is God Himself, and the glory into which we will enter is also God Himself. God is both our hope and our glory. This glory is the very Triune God expressed in the riches of all that He is. God is life, light, love, and many other items. Each item is one of His riches. All of these riches will bear different degrees of glory to express God in different degrees. Ephesians 1 presents a picture of where we are and where we shall go. We are in God as our hope, and we shall go to Him as our glory (1 Pet. 5:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having Been Healed and<br>Brought Back to the Headship of Christ</H2><P>We, the redeemed ones of Christ the Son, have been healed and brought back to the headship of Christ that all things might be headed up in Christ for God's economy and made an inheritance of God for His enjoyment (Eph. 1:7-12). The purpose of the universe is to have all things headed up in one unique Head, and this one unique Head is our Redeemer, the very Christ, the second in the divine Trinity. At the present time, the entire universe is in a heap of collapse, but the day will come at the fullness of the times when all things will be headed up in one wonderful Person. In order for this to be carried out, there is the need for a group of people in God's creation to be firstly gained by this Head. The way for this Head to gain this group of persons is through His death and resurrection. Through His death our sins are taken away, and through His resurrection His life is imparted into us. We are now taking the lead among the created things to be headed up in this one Head. We have received Him, and He has wrought Himself into us to make us one with Him, making us a group of headed up people. The headed up Body of Christ is a living organism with absolutely nothing related to organization. In bringing us back to the headship of Christ, God made us His inheritance for His enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having Been Transfused<br>with the Great Power of God</H2><P>At the end of Ephesians 1 is God's great power, which is the power of resurrection (vv. 19-20), and this resurrection power is the processed Triune God. We, the members of Christ, have been transfused with the great power of God, which raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavenlies, subjected all things under Him, and gave Him to be the Head over all things (vv. 20-22). This great resurrection power has accomplished so much with Christ and in Christ. God's great power that operated in Christ gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, making it the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (vv. 22b-23). Whatever this great power has accomplished with Christ and in Christ is to the church. "To the church" implies a kind of transfusion or transmission. Christ as the great power of resurrection is transmitted into our being, making us the Body of Christ.</P><P>Many Christians have heard something about the church, but not many know the real significance of the church as the Body of Christ. The word for church in Greek is ekklesia, which means the called-out assembly. The church is a congregation of God's called ones. But this is not the ultimate revelation concerning the church. Ultimately, the church is the Body of Christ. The church is the Body of a wonderful Person. Because this Person is wonderful, His Body is wonderful. The Body matches the Head. Christ as a wonderful, all-inclusive, Triune Person needs a wonderful Body, the church. The church is the Body. It is not an organization, but an organism. This Body of Christ is the fullness, the expression, of the One who fills all in all. Christ needs an expression, and this expression is His Body. If a person does not have a body, he does not have an expression; he is not complete, or full. His body is his fullness, the very expression of his being. God desires to have a church as the very Body of Christ to match Him as the universal Head for His full expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being under the Continuous Sealing of the Spirit<br>and with the Pledge of the Spirit</H2><P>The church as the Body of Christ is under the continuous sealing of the consummated, compound, all-inclusive, and life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God (v. 13). An unceasing sealing is going on in us. It is like the circulation of our blood because it is continuous. Such a Spirit as the seal is sealing us all the time with all the ingredients, elements, and essence of the processed Triune God. The all-inclusive Triune God has a consummation, and this consummation is the compound, all-inclusive, and life-giving Spirit.</P><P>On the one hand, we are under the sealing of such a Spirit. On the other hand, we are with this Spirit as the pledge of the all-inclusive, processed Triune God for our foretaste during the church age and our full taste in the coming age for eternity (v. 14). We have not only a sealing but also a pledging going on within us. The Spirit has been given to us as a pledge, as a guarantee that God is ours. He is our inheritance for us to enjoy both in the church age and in the coming age for eternity. The processed, all-inclusive Triune God has given Himself to us as such an inheritance for our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MEMBERS OF AN ORGANISM,<br>THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>We have to see that the church as the Body of Christ is an organism. I have the burden to point this out because when many Christians talk about the church, they have the understanding that it is an organization. We have to reject this concept. We are not a part of an organization. We are members of an organism, the Body of Christ.</P><P>If we go to visit another local church, do we consider ourselves as being one with the saints in that locality? We may unconsciously feel that we belong to the organization in our locality and that now we are guests in the church which we are visiting. Humanly speaking, the saints we are visiting are the hosts and we are their guests. But spiritually speaking, as Christians, believers in Christ, we are members of the one Body of Christ. If we go to visit the saints in London, are we merely a group of Americans in London? Humanly speaking, we are Americans in London. But in the Body of Christ there are no human members; there are only divine members. In the Body of Christ as a divine organism, we all are members in life. When we go to visit any local church, we should not consider that we are foreigners.</P><P>Today we practice the administration of the local churches according to the Bible. A local church is comprised of the saints with the elders, deacons, and deaconesses (Phil. 1:1; Rom. 16:1). Do you consider yourself as a saint, an elder, a deacon, or a deaconess in the local church where you are? My point in asking this question is this&#151;in the local churches, we should not consider ourselves in an organizational way, considering ourselves as a part of an organization. We should only consider ourselves in an organic way. Wherever we are and whatever we do, we should consider ourselves as living members of the organic Body of Christ. When we gather together in the Lord, we all should function as living members. Wherever we go, we are the living members of the Body of Christ. When I go to Anaheim, I go there as a member of the Body of Christ. When I go to Taipei, I go there as a member of the Body of Christ. I never consider myself as someone who belongs to an organization. As the members of the organic Body of Christ, we should live in an organic way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A MASTERPIECE AS THE NEW MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:4-22</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH BEING AN ORGANISM,<br>NOT AN ORGANIZATION</H2><P>In chapter one we saw from Ephesians 1 that the church is the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity. I stress this matter because not many of the Christians throughout the generations have entered into this realization. We may think that the church is just a collection, or a gathering, of all the believers as a kind of collective entity which can be considered as an organization. This is absolutely wrong. The concept of the church being an organization has led the Christians throughout the centuries into confusion, misunderstanding, and a deceived condition. Our burden today is to point out, according to the pure, divine revelation in the New Testament and especially in the book of Ephesians, that the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity is the church as an organism, the Body of Christ.</P><P>I hope that you would study our fellowship in chapter one in light of the first chapter of Ephesians. That fellowship can be a great help and an opener to your understanding of that portion of the Word. The main thing that Ephesians 1 shows us is the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity. Although the word issue is not in Ephesians 1, the fact and the reality of the issue is there. The divine Trinity issues out through His dispensing. In everything that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit accomplished are the dispensing of the Father, the dispensing of the Son, and the dispensing of the Spirit. These dispensings issue in one thing&#151;an organism, the church, which is the Body of Christ.</P><P>A wooden stand is organized with pieces of wood, but a living person with a body is something organic. A robot is an organization of lifeless material, but a living person is an organism. The church should be an organism not an organization. The teaching of Ignatius in the second century gave the ground for organization to come into the church. Ignatius taught that an overseer, a bishop, is higher than an elder. But in Acts 20, Luke made it clear that the overseers and the elders are the same persons. Paul sent for the elders to come to him, and then he told them that the Holy Spirit had appointed them to be the overseers (vv. 17, 28). The elders are the overseers (see note 283 in Acts 20 and note 21 in 1 Timothy 3&#151;Recovery Version). Due to the erroneous teaching of Ignatius, hierarchy came into the church. The episcopal system of ecclesiastical government comes from Ignatius's mistaken teaching as well as the entire hierarchical system of the Roman Catholic Church with the bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. The principle of hierarchy and organization is also among the Protestant denominations and the free groups. Today's Christianity is under the influence of this concept of hierarchy and has been corrupted by it. The teaching, practice, and concept of hierarchy has led many Christians away from the church as an organism to an organization. We were warned when we studied the history of the church in this matter, and Brother Nee helped us to realize that we had to be careful about the matter of organization. The Lord enlightened us to see that such an organizational system annuls the organic Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ, there is no organization. But the fallen and deformed Christianity is full of organization. It is a religious, organizational system.</P><P>Every aspect of the church must be organic because the church is the issue of the living Trinity. The Bible tells us that the embodiment of God, Christ, is life. Christ told us in the Gospel of John that He is the life (John 14:6). Christ is not something organizational. As the embodiment of the Triune God, He is the totality of the divine, eternal life. The totality of life, the living Triune God, issues in one thing&#151;the Body of Christ. Since the Triune God is the totality of life, the Body of Christ is altogether a matter of life. We should put anything that is not of life under our feet. We do not like hierarchy because it is altogether a matter of organization and has nothing to do with the organic Body of Christ.</P><P>The Body of Christ is an issue of the divine Trinity in the same way that Eve was an issue of Adam. God created Adam from the dust of the ground, but He built a woman with a rib out of Adam's side (Gen. 2:22). Adam dispensed himself in the sense that a rib, a part of his being, came out of him. That part of his being became a woman, Eve. What was Eve? Eve was an issue of Adam. Eve was identical to Adam in life, in nature, and in appearance. This is why Adam and Eve could be one flesh, one couple. In like manner, the church is the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity. We have to see the church to such an extent. When we have such a vision, this vision will govern us, protect us, regulate us, and keep us from being misled into a kind of teaching concerning organization. Any thought concerning organization should not be brought into the church life. Any teaching concerning the church in the sense of organization is absolutely wrong, and we must abandon it. It is deceiving, misleading, and of the evil one. The thought of organization related to the church cannot be seen in the entire book of Ephesians, a book on the church. Ephesians reveals that the church is an organism, the Body of Christ.</P><P>We studied the history of the Brethren, who practiced the church life under the leadership of John Nelson Darby in the early part of the nineteenth century. Soon after they were raised up by the Lord, they fell into the snare of organization and were divided. Some of them, the so-called Open Brethren, taught that each of the churches was autonomous. The so-called Closed Brethren were accused of trying to form all the churches into a federation. Both autonomy and federation are outside of the biblical revelation according to the teaching of the apostles.</P><P>Because the United States is an organized government, we can see the matters of autonomy and federation to a certain extent. The fifty states are autonomous to a certain degree but the federal government forms them into a federation. Thus, we can see autonomy to a certain degree in the states and federation in the country as a whole. The individual states, though, are not absolutely independent from one another or from the federal government. Each state does not have its own currency. There is only one currency in the United States. We citizens of the United States pay more tax to the federal government than to the state government. If a case in a court of law cannot be decided by the state court, it eventually goes to the Supreme Court, a federal court. The defense of our nation, for the most part, is a federal matter. Diplomatic relations with other countries are also a federal matter. There are highways that span the continental United States from state to state. What if Oregon had the attitude that only its residents could travel on its highways? The above examples show us that even the states of the United States are not absolutely independent from one another or from the federal government.</P><P>In God's economy and in the Body of Christ, independence is a devilish word. We Christians should never be independent. We should not be independent of God or of one another. We cannot go on in the Christian life if we isolate ourselves from one another. Furthermore, no local church can be absolutely independent from the other local churches. The local churches should be dependent on one another. The church in Seattle should be dependent on the church in Spokane, and the churches in the United States should be dependent on the churches in England. We must be careful concerning the creeping in of different teachings related to matters such as autonomy and federation.</P><P>Could any member of a person's physical body be autonomous in relation to the other members? If one member is in pain, the entire body suffers. Likewise, each member of the Body of Christ is dependent on the other members. Concerning the Body of Christ, Paul tells us, "If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it. Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular" (1 Cor. 12:26-27). The church is the Body of Christ, and as the Body of Christ, no part of the church can be autonomous. My burden for us to see and enter into the reality of the church as the Body of Christ is very heavy because concepts and teachings related to organization, such as the teaching of autonomy, have corrupted, misled, and deceived the Christians and have created many divisions. We are not in any kind of organization. We are in the issue of the Triune God, which is the unique, universal organism, the Body of Christ. We all must declare: "We are in an organism, not in an organization!" Ephesians 1 shows us that the church is the issue of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH BEING A MASTERPIECE AS THE NEW MAN</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>What We Were and Where We Were<br>before Our Salvation</H2><P>Ephesians 2 goes on to show us that the church is a masterpiece as the new man. This chapter begins with the word "and." This indicates that Paul's thought in chapter one has not been completed. He has something further to say. In chapter one Paul shows us that we became the Body of Christ by God's dispensing into us. In chapter two Paul tells us what we were and where we were before our salvation. Verse 1 of chapter two tells us that we were dead persons; we were dead in our offenses and sins. Because we are descendants of Adam, we were born into a kind of life that walks "according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is operating in the sons of disobedience" (Eph. 2:2). "The age of this world," according to which we walked, refers to the modern appearance, the present course of the world, the satanic system. "The ruler" in verse 2 refers to Satan, the prince of the aerial authority. "The spirit" in verse 2 is in apposition with "the authority of the air" and refers to the aggregate power, a personal aggregate of all the evil angelic authorities, over which Satan is the ruler. In the past we walked according to Satan, the ruler of the evil spiritual power, and this evil spiritual power operated in us. Actually, this evil power is the evil one himself, Satan, the enemy of God. According to verse 3, we also behaved ourselves "in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts." Thus, as dead persons, we were in three things in our past: we were walking according to the age of this world, we were walking according to the ruler of the authority of the air, and we were behaving in the lusts of our flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Made Alive, Raised Up, and Seated Together<br>in the Heavenlies in Christ</H2><P>Because we were in such a pitiful condition, we needed God's salvation. The salvation in Ephesians 2 does not stress the forgiveness of sins. Because we were dead persons, the stress in this chapter is on making us alive. A dead person needs life. We needed to be quickened, enliv-ened. The salvation brought to us made us dead persons living. We were made alive, raised up, and seated together in the heavenlies in Christ (vv. 4-10).</P><P>To be enlivened is one thing. To be raised up from among the dead is another step. When Lazarus was buried in the tomb, the Lord Jesus said, "Lazarus, come forth!" (John 11:43). Lazarus was made alive. This was the first step. Secondly, Lazarus was raised from among the dead. After we were raised up, we were seated together in the heavenlies in Christ. Now we are no longer dead persons, but we are living persons seated in the heavenlies. We are living and heavenly. This is the result of the divine dispensing. It was in Christ that God seated us together, once for all, in the heavenlies. The phrase "in Christ" indicates that the Triune God, through the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, has been dispensed into our being. Without Christ we were dead. But the Triune God in Christ came into us and put us into Him. This was the dispensing of the divine Trinity into fallen man. The dispensing of the divine Trinity saved us, quickened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies, making us all living persons in the heavenlies. This took place in Christ's resurrection and ascension (1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 4:8).</P><P>Such a dispensing work made us the masterpiece of God. Ephesians 2:10 tells us that we are His "workmanship." The Greek word for "workmanship" is poiema, which can also be translated into "poem" or "masterpiece." A poem shows the wisdom and design of the composer. We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are also a poem, expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design. We may not think that we are so wonderful, but we have to see the divine fact that Christ is in us and that we are in Christ. In Christ we have been made alive, raised up from among the dead, and seated in the heavenlies. Now we are God's masterpiece because God has dispensed His very Being into our being. There is Someone within us more precious and wonderful than anything in the universe. We have God in us. This makes us wonderful, and this makes us God's masterpiece.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Created in Christ into One New Man<br>through His Death to Be<br>God's Household and Kingdom,<br>Growing and Built into a Temple as<br>God's Dwelling Place</H2><P>In the second part of Ephesians 2, Paul covers another aspect of the church. He tells us that in the past we were "apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world" (v. 12). As those who were apart and away from all these positive things, we were in a miserable condition. In verse 13 Paul continues with two big words&#151;"but now": "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ." We were pitiful persons, "but now!" Now through God's redemption in Christ, we have been brought near to Christ, to Israel, and to God's promise. This equals being near to God and all His blessings. We have been put into Christ, we have become citizens of a divine commonwealth, we have a part in the covenants of the promise, and we all have hope. What a wonderful hope we have been called into! We have God in Christ as our hope.</P><P>In the past we were in a terrible realm, but now we are in a divine realm. How did we experience such a great transfer into the divine realm? We were transferred by being re-created. To be regenerated is to be re-created. We were born into an old realm of sin and death, but the Triune God came to do something for us. He came in His incarnation to die in the flesh. In that death He terminated us, and through that death He released His divine life. Then in resurrection He imparted that divine life into us as the very essence with which He created a new man. When God created the heavens and the earth with thousands of items including man, He never used His essence, His very Being, as the material to create any item. But in this new man, God used Himself as the creating essence.</P><P>Ephesians 2:15 says that through His death on the cross, Christ created us into a new man. In the old man, we were divided. There was a middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles (v. 14). But Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, breaking down the middle wall of partition, and created these two peoples into one new man with a new essence, a new element. This new element is the very divine Trinity dispensed into us. As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; as the new man, the church needs Christ not only as its life but also as its person. The Body is for the expression of the Head, and the new man is for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose. Both the Body and the new man are organic. They have nothing to do with organization.</P><P>We individual believers have been created into one new man. We must be impressed with such a vision so that we could never be independent. We cannot be independent because we all are part of this great, universal new man. God does not want millions of individual Christians. What God wants is a corporate man. All the local churches on this earth are not only the Body of Christ for His expression but also the one new man on this earth to carry out God's will. The local churches cannot be independent from one another. If they were independent from one another, the one new man would be cut into pieces and death would be the result. We must see the awful result of the wrong teaching that the local churches are autonomous.</P><P>In all the local churches, there are some local affairs. But many times the churches need to fellowship with one another to help each other in their affairs. The church in one locality may be wealthy, whereas the church in another locality may be poor. The poor local church may not be able to afford to pay for certain things. The wealthy local church may have the attitude that all the local churches are autonomous in their business affairs and that the poorer local church should endeavor to do something without depending on them. This understanding and attitude are not right. A certain financial matter may be a local administration affair, but even in such a matter, the churches should depend on one another. Sometimes a certain church should communicate, fellowship, with another church even in the matter of material needs. Sometimes the churches in Taiwan should have fellowship with the churches in France in the financial help. Even in material things, we cannot say that the churches are independently autonomous.</P><P>The churches should not be absolutely independent of one another. All the believers should depend on one another, and all the local churches should depend on one another. Especially in spiritual things, we should depend on one another. The church in a certain city may need help from the other churches in life and in its building up. The local churches should be in a situation of mutual dependence. The concept of autonomy is awful because it makes the churches separate from one another. We should not forget that all the believers in this entire universe are one man. This one man includes the believers at Paul's time, the believers at our time, and the believers who will be born in the future. This one new man includes all the local churches. The one new man is doing God's will, carrying out God's eternal purpose.</P><P>We have been created in Christ into one new man through His death to be God's household and kingdom, growing and being built into a temple as God's dwelling place (vv. 11-22). This masterpiece as the new man is a collective entity, a household, a family. It is also a kingdom, a commonwealth. We are no longer strangers and sojourners but God's household, participating in the divine life and enjoying the divine riches. We are also God's kingdom, sharing the kingdom right and bearing the kingdom responsibility (v. 19). Furthermore, this new man as the household of God and the kingdom of God is growing into a temple as God's dwelling place (vv. 20-22). To grow into a temple is to be built together into the dwelling place of God.</P><P>If the local churches were independently autonomous, our enjoyment of the one new man as God's household, God's kingdom, and God's dwelling place would be annulled. We have to grow and be built up together into a temple as God's dwelling place for His purpose. All the saints and all the local churches need to grow together and be built up with one another. Then we can be one temple, one dwelling place, in the one kingdom and for the one family. Thus, the Father will accomplish His heart's desire. We need the proper apprehension of what the church is. The church is the Body of Christ and the new man to accomplish God's eternal purpose by being God's family, God's kingdom, and God's dwelling place.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SUPPLIED WITH THE RICHES OF CHRIST<br>UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:2-21</H1><P>Ephesians 1 discloses to us God's good pleasure in His heart's desire. God desires to have a Body prepared for Christ to be the full expression of the Triune God. He carries this out by dispensing His divine Trinity into His chosen people. Ephesians 2 shows us that God remade, re-created, regenerated, us by Christ passing through death and resurrection and entering into ascension. We were dead persons, but in His death, resurrection, and ascension we have been remade, re-created. Through this re-creation, we have been transferred out of our old realm and into a new one. We have been made a new man in God's new creation. This new man is God's family and God's kingdom, growing into God's temple and built up into a dwelling place for God in our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S DISPENSATION</H2><P>In Ephesians 3 Paul unveils God's heart's desire from another angle. Ephesians 3 shows us that God, according to His heart's desire, made a plan, and this plan is His economy. God's plan, or economy, is also His arrangement, His dispensation. This dispensation was hidden in God, who created all things, as a mystery until the New Testament age. This hidden plan, this mystery, was revealed to the apostles and prophets in spirit (v. 5). They received a revelation of this mystery, and they spoke concerning it. The Apostle Paul saw God's plan. He came to know this mystery, which is called the mystery of Christ because it is altogether concerning Christ (v. 4). The New Testament is a record of the New Testament ministry that has released what was hidden in God's heart to unveil the mystery of Christ. When we read the book of Ephesians, however, we may pick up outward matters such as husbands loving their wives and wives submitting to their husbands. We do not focus on "the dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God" (v. 9). Our fellowship in this chapter may be considered as a master key to open the doors in Ephesians 3.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STEWARDSHIP OF GOD'S GRACE<br>TO DISPENSE THE RICHES OF CHRIST</H2><P>God desires to dispense His divine Trinity into His chosen people. He wants to distribute the untraceable or unsearchable riches of Christ into us (v. 8). We can enjoy the riches of Christ by eating Him. The first time I released a message on eating Jesus was in Taipei in 1958. A brother who was a professor came to me after the meeting and told me that the expression eating Jesus was too wild and rough. I pointed this brother to the Lord's word in John 6:57&#151;"He who eats Me shall also live because of Me." I told him that since the Lord Jesus said that we should eat Him, we must say the same thing. To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life. Then we live by Him whom we receive. As our spiritual food, He is unsearchably rich.</P><P>Ephesians 3 is a chapter on the distribution of the riches of Christ. God has a plan to distribute the unsearchable and untraceable riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are firstly what Christ is to us. Christ is the life, the light, the way, and the truth (John 8:12; 14:6). Christ is righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (1 Cor. 1:30). Christ is typified by many items in the Old Testament. He is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham (Matt. 1:1). The riches of what Christ is, what He has accomplished, what He is doing now, what He shall do, what He has attained, and what He has obtained are unsearchable. The riches of Christ are exhaustless.</P><P>Colossians 2:9 says that Christ is the embodiment of all the fullness of the Godhead. "Fullness" refers to the expression of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead, but also the expression of the riches of what God is. When a cup is filled with water to the extent that it overflows with water, the overflow of the water is the fullness of the water. What comes out of the cup is the fullness of its contents. Ephesians 3 reveals that we are supplied with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God. The riches of Christ are for the fullness of God and the riches of Christ will result in the fullness of God. God's plan as a mystery hidden in Christ was to distribute all His riches stored in Christ as His very embodiment into His chosen and redeemed people in order to make the church the very fullness of God, the expression of God.</P><P>To carry out His plan, God needs an arrangement, a dispensation, and He also needs some stewards. If we want to prepare a great feast for many people, we need to have a plan to serve them with many rich dishes. We also need some stewards, or waiters, to dispense this rich food. The serving of the waiters is a kind of distribution. If they did not serve the food, the people would have nothing to eat. In Ephesians 3 is God's dispensation, which is His hidden plan (v. 9). This chapter also tells us of the "stewardship of the grace of God" which was given to Paul (v. 2). The Greek word oikonomia may be translated into economy, dispensation, or stewardship. With God it is an economy, or a dispensation. But with Paul it was a stewardship. His ministry was a stewardship. In Paul's time, great families with many riches hired stewards to dispense, to distribute, those riches. God made a plan as a dispensation within Himself. This plan was hidden in God until the New Testament age. God raised up apostles whom He commissioned to carry out His distributing plan, and this commission is the stewardship. The apostles' stewardship is to distribute to His chosen people what Christ is, what Christ has done, what Christ is doing, what Christ will do, and what Christ has attained and obtained. This stewardship is the stewardship of grace to dispense, to distribute, the riches of Christ (vv. 2, 7-9). The distribution of the riches of Christ results in the church.</P><P>The apostles' commission is to distribute the unsearchable riches of Christ to God's chosen people. Gospel preaching is a kind of distribution. Paul tells us that he received God's grace to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel (v. 8). Our preaching the gospel is a distribution to the God-chosen sinners of what Christ is and of what Christ has done. After we preach the gospel to them, we must continue to work with them like the apostles did. The apostles preached the gospel, taught the truth, set up churches, and then labored to build up the churches. Everything that they did was a distributing work. What we are doing in the Lord's ministry is to distribute the riches of Christ to all the God-chosen and Christ-redeemed people.</P><P>The riches of Christ may be likened to all the rich foodstuffs produced in America. America has many rich foodstuffs such as eggs, chicken, beef, fish, vegetables, and fruits. To distribute these riches of America, a plan is needed. Then some stewards are needed to do the distribution work. When these riches are eaten, digested, and assimilated by us, they become a part of us, and they even become us. A husky American man who assimilates so much of the American foodstuffs is the fullness, the expression, of the riches of America. This man is the totality of the rich food of America. The riches eventually result in a person and become the constituents that constitute that person. In like manner, the riches of Christ result in a corporate person, the church. The church is the mystery of Christ, which is the Body of Christ constituted with the untraceable riches of Christ (vv. 3-6, 8b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH DISPLAYING<br>THE MULTIFARIOUS WISDOM OF GOD</H2><P>The church as revealed in Ephesians 3 is mainly for the display of God's multifarious wisdom to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies, especially to Satan and his angels (vv. 9-11). God had a plan that He kept within Him for many years as a mystery until the day came when He showed His plan to some of His apostles, making them stewards to distribute all the unsearchable and untraceable riches of Christ to God's chosen ones. The result of these chosen ones' enjoyment of the riches of Christ is that they are constituted the church. Thus, the church becomes the wise exhibition of all that Christ is, displaying the multifarious wisdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</H2><P>We may have enjoyed Christ in His riches, but we need to enjoy Him more. Christ is in us, but how much is He in us? Because of God's heart's desire for the church to be constituted with the riches of Christ, Paul prayed for the church. He prayed that the Father would grant us, "according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man" (v. 16). When the time for my dinner is near, I may be very hungry and even exhausted. But after I eat, the food that is within me strengthens and upholds me. I am strengthened and upheld according to the riches of American food. Paul's prayer is that we would be strengthened according to the riches of the Father's glory.</P><P>We need to be strengthened with power through the Spirit into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts (v. 17). The phrase "make His home" is only one word in Greek, katoikeo. Kata, the prefix of this word, means down. Christ is making His home deep down in our hearts. Christ is in us, but is He settled in us? When a person moves into a new house, he needs to get settled in that house. In other words, he needs to make his home there. Then every room of that house becomes inhabited by him. When I am a guest in someone else's house, I do not have the freedom to go into every room. A guest in a house is limited to certain rooms. Christ does not want to be a guest in our hearts by being limited to certain rooms. He desires to settle down in our hearts, to make His home deep down in our hearts. Christ has to be added into us. The very Christ who is in us has to increase within us.</P><P>How much of Christ do we have within us? According to my observation, Christ is within some believers as a prisoner. He is limited within them in a small area, that is, imprisoned within them in a small cell. Is Christ free to occupy our mind? Sometimes we may say, "Lord, at least tonight, give me the freedom in my mind." When the sisters go to a department store, they may want to buy something, but the Lord would not agree. Then they might say, "Lord, allow me to buy it this time." We would not allow the Lord to make His home deep within our hearts. This is why Paul prayed that the Father would grant us to be strengthened according to the riches of His glory with power through His Spirit into the inner man. When we get strengthened into the inner man, this opens the way for Christ to get Himself settled in our entire being. Christ is in us, but He needs to saturate and permeate every part of our entire being. We need to enter into the reality of what verse 7 of #501 in Hymns says:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Thy Spirit will me saturate,<br>Every part will God permeate,<br>Deliv'ring me from the old man,<br>With all saints building for His plan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Christ making His home deep down in our hearts is an organic matter full of life and has nothing to do with any kind of organization. The church is not an organization but an organism. With an organism, the growth in life is what counts. The more we grow in life, the more we are in this organism. The more we grow in life, the more Christ will be able to make His home deep down in our very being. As Christ makes His home in our inward parts, we are filled with His untraceable riches resulting in all the fullness of the Triune God&#151;the Body of Christ as the full expression of the Triune God (v. 19b).</P><P>In Paul's prayer the word "that" is used four times: "that He would grant you..to be strengthened..into the inner man"; "that Christ may make His home in your hearts"; "that you..may be strong to apprehend..and to know"; and "that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God." The second "that" is the result of the first, the third is the result of the second, and the fourth is the result of the third. Here we see several steps. From Paul's prayer we are strengthened; from being strengthened we proceed to Christ's making His home in our hearts; and from this we progress to apprehending the dimensions of Christ and knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ until we are finally filled unto all the fullness of God. Paul's prayer reveals that we are supplied and filled with the unsearchable and untraceable riches of Christ unto, or resulting in, the fullness of God. In other words, these riches will become the very fullness of God in us through our experience and enjoyment of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE AND<br>OUR SERVICE IN THE CHURCH LIFE BEING ORGANIC</H2><P>On the one hand, we may talk about enjoying Christ and eating Christ. But on the other hand, we may talk about matters in the church life in the realm of organization. If we talk about organization in relation to the church life, we are off from the central lane of God's New Testament economy. Our practice of the church life and our service in the church life must be organic. Even our practical service, such as the cleaning of the hall, should be organic. We could clean our meeting hall in three ways. First, we could hire some janitors to do the work. Second, we could make some organizational arrangement to appoint some brothers and sisters to be responsible for the cleaning of different areas of the hall. The third way is the organic way. If some saints are living organically in Christ, enjoying Him all day long, they will become burdened to clean the hall. When the church realizes their burden, they may announce that Saturday morning is the time for all the burdened ones to come to the hall to serve. Then the saints serve, not by being hired or organizationally arranged, but by being organically one with the living Christ.</P><P>About forty years ago in Shanghai, there was a sister in the church who was the wife of the manager of a big bank. Although she had servants in her home, this sister was burdened to clean the hall every Saturday morning. After her husband's chauffeur drove him to the bank, she would ask him to drive her to the hall. Because the hall was not on an open street but in a narrow lane, the chauffeur dropped her off near the hall and drove away. One day he decided to follow her because he wanted to find out why she was going to this part of town every Saturday morning. When she got out of the car on Saturday morning, he parked the car and followed her from a distance. He was shocked to see her cleaning the hall. He wondered why she would do this. She was the wife of a rich man who had servants cleaning his home, but every Saturday she went to the hall to do the cleaning work. Her service was something organic. She did not clean the hall because she had been hired or assigned. She cleaned the hall organically.</P><P>Some people told us that if we were going to attempt to build the church organically, nothing would be accomplished. They asked how the hall would be cleaned without hiring anyone or without making some arrangements. Our answer is this&#151;God is able. God is able to accomplish superabundantly according to the power which operates in us (v. 20). We must believe God's word in the Bible. He is able to accomplish whatever He has spoken concerning us. The more that we minister Christ to people, the more they will come to serve. This service is organic.</P><P>The entire Body of Christ is an organic matter. In the book of Revelation, the leading ones in the churches are not referred to as elders but as the stars, the messengers of the churches (1:20). The messengers are the spiritual ones in the churches bearing the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus. They should be of the heavenly nature and in a heavenly position like stars. The eldership is not a positional matter in an organization. An elder is a person of maturity. We have to respect the elders in their life maturity. Thank the Lord that there are some dear saints among us who have more stature in the growth of Christ. We respect them because of their growth in life. We do not regard them as ones in a certain position. The Lord Jesus told us that we are all brothers (Matt. 23:8). No one has a position to control the other saints. The difference among the saints is not in organization but in their organic situation. If a brother is more experienced, more matured, and has more measure in the growth of Christ, he is more useful in the church.</P><P>A little babe of five months would not be assigned to do anything in his home. But when he grows up to be five years old, his parents might assign him a small task. Without his organic growth, his parents would not arrange for him to do this. Their arrangement would be according to their son's organic situation. If I did not have the adequate growth in Christ, the brothers might arrange for me to speak and I might have the burden to speak, but what could I speak? I would not be able to speak because of my limited growth in Christ. To bear more responsibility in the church, we have to eat more and grow more so that we possess a greater measure of the growth in life. The church is not like a worldly club, organization, or society. Everything related to the church is a matter of the organic growth in life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ONE BODY<br>BUILT UP BY THE ONE MINISTRY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:3-32</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STEWARDSHIP<br>TO DISTRIBUTE THE RICHES OF CHRIST</H2><P>We have seen that the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity is the Body of Christ for God's full expression. God made a plan, an arrangement, to carry out His dispensing, and this arrangement was hidden in Himself as a mystery. In the New Testament age, He revealed this mystery to His apostles, making them stewards with a stewardship to distribute the untraceable riches of Christ. Their distributing work is the divine dispensing. To distribute the riches of Christ is to dispense the divine Trinity into God's chosen people that God may have a church for the exhibition of His multifarious wisdom to the angelic rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, especially to Satan and his angels. On the one hand, God made a plan, a divine arrangement. On the other hand, He commissioned His apostles with a stewardship to carry out His plan to distribute all the riches of Christ.</P><P>The apostles distribute the riches of Christ by preaching the unsearchable riches of Christ to the God-chosen sinners. These chosen sinners, after hearing the good news and believing in the Lord Jesus, received Him as their Savior, Redeemer, forgiveness, justification, and reconciliation. They were regenerated to participate in the divine life as one item of the unsearchable riches of Christ. When these believers come together, outwardly, they are the called-out congregation, the church. Inwardly, they are the organic issue of the Triune God to be the Body of Christ.</P><P>For these new believers to hear only the initial preaching of the riches of Christ so that they could receive Christ and become His members is not complete. This is why the apostles continued to teach the truth to the saved members of Christ. The apostles established them and raised them up as local churches in different localities. After establishing the churches, the apostles then returned to perfect the saints that they might grow in the life of Christ in order to participate in the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ. The apostles must minister more and more riches of Christ into the living members of the Body of Christ in order to perfect them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE APOSTLE'S PRAYER IN EPHESIANS 3</H2><P>The Apostle Paul prayed that the saints would experience Christ in all of His riches for the building up of His Body. In Ephesians 3, he prayed that the Father would grant these members of the Body of Christ to be strengthened through the Spirit into their inner man (v. 16). The inner man is our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God to become a mingled spirit. Now we are one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). How wonderful this is! But we must confess that we do not spend most of our time in our spirit. Although we are the organic members of Christ, we still spend too much time in our mind, emotion, and will. After becoming members of the Body of Christ, we have been bothered, troubled, and confused by our ugly mind, emotion, and will. Because we spend so much time in our mind, emotion, and will, we are troubled by anxiety. The brothers are mostly in their mind, the sisters are mostly in their emotions, and all of us exercise our independent will.</P><P>Our inward being is like a building composed of four rooms: our mind, our emotion, our will, and our spirit. The spirit is the unique room, the wonderful room, the room that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth. It is the room that makes us one with the Lord. We all have to admit, though, that we do not spend much time in this room. This is why Paul was so burdened to bow his knees to the Father to pray that the Father would grant us to be strengthened with His divine power through His Spirit into the inner man. Because we are mostly in the rooms of our mind, emotion, and will and not in our spirit, the wonderful room, we need to be strengthened into our inner man. To turn to our spirit is to come back to our inner man. Whenever we turn to our spirit, everything is ready for Christ to move, to work, to spread, and to root Himself in our entire being. Christ desires to spread within us, to work Himself and to root Himself deep down into every part of our inner being, our heart (Eph. 3:17a).</P><P>The three main rooms of our heart are our mind, emotion, and will. Christ is now in our spirit, but our heart may be devoid of Him. The rooms of our heart are short of Christ. They are full of other things such as anxiety, vain thoughts, imaginations, and self-decisions. What is in our heart? Things other than Christ, such as department store sales, a Master's degree, a better car, or modern fashions, may fill up our heart. You are a Christian, a member of Christ, but what are you thinking about? Do you have Christ in your mind, in your will, and in your emotion? Where is Christ? He may be imprisoned in your weakened spirit. You may be so strong in your mind, emotion, and will but so weak in your spirit. After rising up in the morning some may immediately be thinking about a sale at a certain department store. Their spirit is weakened by all of the things in the other rooms&#151;their mind, emotion, and will. This is why Paul prayed for us. His prayer was unique.</P><P>Not only did Paul pray for us but also our High Priest in the heavens is interceding for us and within us (Heb. 7:25-26). While you are thinking about other things, something is there reminding you to turn to the Lord and to call on Him. You may say, "O Lord Jesus, I do not love You, but Lord, make me willing to love You." Then you may continue to pray, "Lord Jesus, have mercy upon me. Lord, fill me with Yourself. Take me over, Lord. Occupy me and spread Yourself within me." If you prayed in such a way for ten minutes, you would be strengthened into your inner man. You would no longer be in your mind, emotion, or will but in your spirit. Your prayer would make a way for Christ to make His home deep down in your heart. In your prayer you have the sensation that you are rooted for growth and grounded for building up in the divine love, the nobler love, the very agape (Gk.) of God (Eph. 3:17b).</P><P>When you are strengthened into your inner man through prayer, Christ has a way to make His home in your heart and you are strong to apprehend the dimensions of Christ, not individually but with all the saints (v. 18). You have to come to the meetings of the church to meet with all the saints so that you can apprehend the dimensions of the universally extensive Christ&#151;the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth. No one knows how broad, how long, how high, or how deep Christ is. His dimensions are the dimensions of the universe! They are immeasurable. We need to be strong to grasp with all the saints the extensiveness of Christ. We need to explore the universally extensive field of the Christ whom we are in. When we apprehend the extensiveness of this universal Christ, we are led to know the knowledge-surpassing and unlimited love of Christ that we may be filled with the extensive Christ unto all the fullness of the Triune God (v. 19), which is the church as the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ, the church, is the result of our being filled with the extensive Christ to be the very expression, the manifestation in full, of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>BEING THE ISSUE OF THE WONDERFUL,<br>MARVELOUS, EXCELLENT DIVINE TRINITY</H2><P>The church as the Body of Christ is like a wonderful gem without any foreign particles, or blemishes. Matters such as autonomy, federation, organization, regulation, and control are foreign particles in the church, the wonderful gem. We should not bring in any foreign particles to the Lord's recovery. The church as the Body of Christ is a gem as the issue of the wonderful, marvelous, excellent divine Trinity. Who can tell of the excellency of this gem? It is shameful to bring in foreign particles to this gem such as autonomy, federation, organization, regulation, and control. We need to reject these foreign particles. "Lord Jesus, thank You for such a gem, the Body of Christ as the very issue of the wonderful, marvelous, excellent divine Trinity, the fullness of the Godhead embodied in You."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>In Ephesians 1 and 2, Paul tells us what the church is. The church is the desire of God's good pleasure that issues out of Himself as the divine Trinity. The materials of the church were sinners, dead in offenses and sins. But God, through His incarnation, went to the cross to accomplish an all-inclusive death, passed through resurrection, and entered into ascension. Through these processes, these chosen sinners were remade, re-created, regenerated, to be persons who were made alive, resurrected, and ascended with Christ to be seated with Him in the heavenlies in Christ. They were made into God's masterpiece as the new man. In Ephesians 3 Paul shows us that this masterpiece comes out of God's plan with God's stewardship. Now in Ephesians 4, Paul shows us another aspect of the church. He talks about the Body of Christ from another angle, the angle of the building up of the Body of Christ. This organic Body of Christ needs to be built up.</P><P>We must understand the Bible in an organic way. The church needs to be built up organically in the same way that a newborn child needs to be built up. The child needs to be perfected, completed, and developed. This babe is built up by growing. Mothers know that they cannot build up their children by organization. A child's growth does not depend on any outward arrangement or organization. It depends upon life and the growth in life. For a child to grow adequately he needs sunshine, fresh air, and proper food and water. As long as he is regularly fed with the proper food, he will grow. When he grows, he is being built up. A child cannot be built up without growing. In like manner, the basic factor, the basic element, that is needed for the building up of a young church, a baby church, is for it to grow. The church cannot be built up by organization or arrangement. The church can only be built up by being fed, not with doctrines but with the riches of Christ.</P><P>Before the Lord's recovery came to the United States, we had not heard about such things as enjoying Christ, experiencing Christ, or Christ's becoming a life-giving Spirit in His resurrection. We did not know that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in our spirit. We did not even know that we had a human spirit. We also did not know about God's dispensing, the mingling of God with man, or the crucial revelation of life in the Scriptures. The Lord has brought us into the realization and enjoyment of His unsearchable riches, and we are still on the way in the Lord's ministry to distribute more and more of His riches.</P><P>We studied church history and the biographies of many spiritual saints. We spent many years to study the teachings of the church fathers and the top teachings throughout the history of the church. The Lord has granted us a merciful discernment to discern what we should receive that matches the divine revelation in the holy Scriptures. We have picked up the top positive, scriptural, and spiritual things to present to the Lord's children. Some have gone back to past writings and have picked up G. H. Lang's teaching of autonomy from his book The Churches of God. We were warned in the past concerning this erroneous teaching of autonomy. Is any part of a living person autonomous? Can we say that his eyes, ears, or nose are independently autonomous from the rest of his body? Of course not. There is no possibility of either autonomy or federation in a person's body because they are organizational matters. The initial aspect of the church is that it is the called-out congregation, the assembly, the ekklesia. The church is also the kingdom, the family, and the temple, the dwelling place of God. But these aspects of the church are not the peak of the revelation concerning the church. The peak is that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, and a masterpiece as the new man. The church is the new man! The parts of a man's body are not federated together nor are they independently autonomous. Autonomy and federation have nothing to do with the church, the organic Body of Christ and the new man. We need to be warned concerning teachings that distract us away from God's central purpose to build up the organic Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE UNIQUE BODY WITH ONE SPIRIT, ONE LORD,<br>AND ONE GOD AND FATHER OF ALL</H2><P>The Body of Christ is one unique Body with one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all (Eph. 4:3-6). This one Body is the expression of the all-inclusive Christ (1:23). The one Spirit is the essence of the one Body. The Triune God expresses Himself in the one Body, and the essence of this Body is the one Spirit. The one Lord is the object of our faith and baptism. We believed into Him and we were baptized into Him. Now we are in Him. The one God and Father of all, who is over all, through all, and in all, is the source of life and the object of our worship. We came out of the Father and now He has to be our unique object of worship. The thought of the Trinity is implied in the fact that the Father is over all, through all, and in all. "Over all" mainly refers to the Father, "through all" to the Son, and "in all" to the Spirit. One Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all are the elements of the very oneness of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BUILT UP BY ONE MINISTRY<br>OF MANY GIFTED PERSONS PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br>TO DO THE SAME ONE BUILDING UP WORK</H2><P>The Body is built by one ministry of many gifted persons perfecting the saints to do the same one building up work (4:7-16). The ministry mentioned in Ephesians 4:12 is referred to by Paul in 2 Corinthians 3 where he also told us that the Old Testament had one ministry, the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of death, which is the ministry of the law (vv. 7-9). In the Old Testament age, there were many priests, prophets, and kings, but they all participated in the one ministry of the law, which was the ministry of condemnation unto death. In the New Testament there is another ministry, the ministry of grace, which is the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness unto justification of life (2 Cor. 3:8-9; Rom. 5:17, 21). All the ones who served the Lord and ministered Christ for the building up of His Body throughout the centuries had different ministries which were all a part of the unique New Testament ministry. The Body is built up by one ministry, the unique New Testament ministry.</P><P>For the building up of the Body, the Head has given some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11-12). Their work is "for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ" (4:12). Therefore, the saints are perfected by the gifted ones to do the work of the ministry also. In Ephesians 4:12 "unto the work of ministry" is in apposition to "unto the building up of the Body of Christ." Thus, the work of the ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ. The gifted persons have the same one ministry to build up the Body of Christ. The one Body is built up by one ministry.</P><P>In today's Christianity, so-called ministries that are different from the apostles' ministry build up denominations. One so-called ministry builds up the Presbyterian denomination. Another so-called ministry builds up the Baptist denomination. Still other so-called ministries build up the Episcopalian and Methodist denominations. In Christianity there are many different ministries outside of and other than the one unique ministry, and these issue in division after division.</P><P>When I refer to "one ministry," I do not mean that this one ministry is my ministry. But I would say that my ministry is a part of the one ministry. Each member of the Body of Christ has a ministry that is a part of the unique New Testament ministry. Some sisters may be burdened organically to clean the hall. This cleaning of the hall is their ministry, which is a service for the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. The saints who go out to preach the gospel are carrying out their ministry as a part of the New Testament ministry to build up the Body of Christ. The Head has given all the gifted persons to perfect the saints so that they may participate in the ministry which the gifted persons are carrying out for the building up of the Body of Christ. To perfect the saints is to develop their organs, equipping and furnishing them with functions through the growth in the life of Christ. Eventually, all the saints do the same one building up work as the gifted members. The saints are perfected to do the work of the ministry for the direct building up of the Body of Christ by their growth in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LIVING A LIFE THAT CAN CARRY OUT THE WORK<br>OF THE MINISTRY TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Verses 17-32 of Ephesians 4 is another section showing us how to build up the Body of Christ by the growth in Christ. Verse 15 says that we need to grow up into Christ in all things, and then the rest of chapter four unveils the details of this growth in Christ to have a life that is suitable and adequate for the building up of the Body of Christ. Paul tells us that we should no longer walk as the nations who walk in the vanity of the mind, estranged from the life of God (vv. 17-18). When we walk according to the life of God within us, we do not have a hardened heart, we are not in darkness, we care for the consciousness of our conscience, and we would not give place to the Devil (v. 27). We also need to walk in truth, that is, in the reality as it is in Jesus (v. 21). God is the truth, the reality. Ephesians 4 also says that we have put off, regarding our former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit (v. 22). Deceit is personified. It refers to the deceiver, the Devil, from whom are the lusts of the corrupted old man. For the building up of the Body of Christ, we need to put off the old man and be renewed in the spirit of our mind (v. 23). This renewing is for our transformation to the image of Christ. Our regenerated spirit is mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God. Such a mingled spirit spreads into our mind, thus becoming the spirit of our mind. It is in such a spirit that we are renewed for our transformation.</P><P>In our baptism we put off the old man and the old manner of life, and we put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth (4:24; Rom. 6:6, 4a; Col. 2:11-12). Righteousness is being right with God and man according to God's righteous way, while holiness is being separated unto God from anything common and being saturated with God's holy nature. We need to live a life of righteousness and holiness. This is the way that Jesus lived on this earth to set up a pattern of One who lived a life of always doing things in God, with God, and for God, ministering Himself as grace to others. We learn from Him, according to His example, not by our natural life, but by Him as our life. We need to live a life that gives grace to others for the needful building up. This is a life that ministers Christ to others as their enjoyment and supply for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:29). We should not let any corrupt word proceed out of our mouth but only the words that give grace to others. In all of our speaking, we should distribute the riches of Christ.</P><P>To build up the Body of Christ, we must also learn not to grieve the Holy Spirit so that He can keep sealing us for the day of the redemption of our body (v. 30). We should always make the Spirit happy. Everything in our behavior should be pleasant to Him. The sealing Spirit is continuously sealing us with the essence and element of the Triune God. When a piece of paper is sealed with a seal, the paper receives the ink essence and also the likeness and the shape of the seal. The sealing Spirit brings the essence of the Triune God into us and causes us to bear the likeness of the Triune God.</P><P>A life that builds up the Body of Christ is also a forgiving life. To practice the Body life we need to forgive one another, forgetting one another's offending, as God in Christ forgets our offenses (v. 32b; Heb. 8:12). To forgive means to forget. Because we are still in our old man much of the time, we make mistakes and offend others. This is why we need to forgive others by the life of God in the Spirit of God.</P><P>Ephesians 4:17-32 gives us a picture of a life that can carry out the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ. There is much, much hope, promise, and potential that all the churches in the Lord's recovery could be built up in this way. May the Lord bring us into the reality of the one Body built up by one ministry with thousands of saints perfected to live a life that is adequate and qualified to do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CHILDREN OF LIGHT<br>TO BE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:1-32</H1><P>In the previous chapter, we saw from Ephesians 4 that the church is one unique Body which is built up by the one New Testament ministry. To participate in this building up ministry we need to live a life that is full of God's reality and God's grace. Reality is God realized by us in the Son, and grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment. We need to live a life of reality and grace through which we can build up the Body of Christ. To live such a life we must realize that through baptism we have put away our old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the personified deceit, Satan himself (Eph. 4:22), and that we have also put on the new man which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the personified truth, the Triune God Himself (v. 24). We need to be daily and continually renewed in the spirit of the mind, the wonderful mingled spirit which fills, occupies, and directs our mind (v. 23). Daily and hourly we should be under this renewing, that we might be transformed to be the proper materials for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>Ephesians 4 also shows us that such a life requires that we no longer walk in vanity (v. 17) and that we give no place to the evil one, the Devil (v. 27). We also should never grieve the Holy Spirit, who fills us and is continuously sealing us, making us full of the very nature of God and causing us to bear the very likeness of the One whom we love and to whom we belong (v. 30). Such a life is always willing to forgive others, to forget others' trespasses or offenses toward us, just as our Father God in Christ has forgiven and forgotten our offenses (v. 32). Such a life qualifies us and enables us to participate in the building up of the organism of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The book of Ephesians tells us that the called ones of God as a congregation are the church (1:1, 22), the assembly, and that this church is God's kingdom (2:12-13, 19), God's family (2:19), and God's temple (2:21), His dwelling place (2:22). Moreover, the church is the Body of Christ (1:23; 4:4) and the new man (2:15). Eventually, the Body of Christ and the new man become the bride of Christ (5:23-32). The assembly and the kingdom apparently are not something organic. But the family, the Body, the new man, and the wife, the Bride, are all organic. For the church to be the Body of Christ there is the need of life. In the Body the most crucial matter is life. When life is gone, the Body is finished. For the church to be the new man there is the need of a person. A man must have a person, and the person of the new man is Christ Himself. Furthermore, for the church to be the bride of Christ, there is the need of love. For a wife, a bride, the most important thing is love. Christ is our love because He is our husband. He is our life, our person, and our love.</P><P>Each chapter of the book of Ephesians unveils the mystery of the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God from a particular point of view. Chapter one shows us that the Body of Christ is the issue of the dispensing of the divine Trinity. Chapter two shows us that this Body is a masterpiece as the new man. In chapter three Paul unveils that we are supplied with the riches of Christ to be the fullness of the Triune God. In chapter four is the one Body built up by the one ministry. In Ephesians 5 Paul goes on to tell us something further concerning the Body of Christ from another angle or point of view. If we read Ephesians 5 in a superficial way, we will not be able to see its point of view. We must dive into the depths of the truth unveiled in this chapter to see something further. This chapter reveals the children of light for the preparation of the bride of Christ. The children of light and the bride of Christ are the two crucial matters in Ephesians 5. To be the children of light who walk in love and light is to be prepared to participate in the bride of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WALKING IN LOVE AND LIGHT</H2><P>According to Ephesians 4, we need grace and truth for the life that qualifies us to participate in the building up of the Body of Christ. Chapter five of Ephesians is higher and deeper than chapter four. It goes on to show us that we need to walk in love and light (vv. 2, 8). Love is the source of grace, and light is the source of truth. When love is expressed, it becomes grace. When light shines out, it becomes truth. Christ came from God to express God, to manifest God. When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace and His light becomes truth. When we receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior and our life, we are brought into fellowship with the Father to enjoy Him as love and light (see note 2l in Ephesians 5&#151;Recovery Version). The Son is the expression of love, which to us is grace, and this grace brings us to the source of grace, which is the Father as love. In the Gospel of John there is grace (John 1:14), but in the first Epistle of John there is love (1 John 4:8, 16). Christ also came to bring us the truth, the reality. When we have the truth, the truth brings us to the source of truth, the Father as light. Jesus Christ brings us to the Father, who is love as the source of grace and who is light as the source of truth. In Ephesians 5 we are children of light walking in love and light.</P><P>In writing the book of Ephesians, Paul was much higher than any philosopher, such as Confucius or Socrates. What human being could compose this book? Where did Paul pick up these points? Many of the terms he used, such as the Body of Christ, cannot be found in the Old Testament. Paul was one who was gained by the Triune God to be mingled with Him. In 1 Corinthians 7:40 he said, "I think that I also have the Spirit of God." He was living in the principle of incarnation as a God-man when he wrote the wonderful things in his Epistles. All these things were unveiled to him and were written by him, and they are in our hands. If there were not such a book as the Bible on the earth, what darkness we would be in! But since we have this book, what light we are in! We are really the children of light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHILDREN OF LIGHT</H2><P>Ephesians 5:1 says, "Become therefore imitators of God, as beloved children." To live a life of love and light we have One whom we may imitate. We have a Father who is love and who is light. As children of the Father, we have His life and nature. The children are spontaneously the imitators of the Father. Every child as an imitator of God is a "xerox copy" of the Father. We are not strangers to God trying to imitate Him. We are children of God, possessing God's life and enjoying God's nature. By our Father's divine life we can be imitators of Him.</P><P>We also have Christ as our pattern. Ephesians 5:2 says, "And walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor." An offering is a gift for fellowship with God, whereas a sacrifice is for redemption from sin. Christ loved us (vv. 2, 25) and Christ shines upon us (v. 14). He is our pattern for us to live a life in love and in light. By ourselves we could not love others as Christ loved us. We can love as He loved because He is our life. We have Him as our life and as our person. We have a person in us who loved us, and now by this person, in this person, and with this person we can love as He loved. This is organic, something of life.</P><P>The life of the children of light qualifies us to participate in the preparation of the bride of Christ. Revelation 19:7 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready." When the wedding of the Lamb comes, we, the children of light, will be a bride to satisfy the One who loves us. To be ready requires preparation. The way to prepare ourselves to be the bride of Christ is to be the children of light always walking and working in love and light as our Savior did. We can imitate our Father God and take Christ as our pattern to walk and work in love and light.</P><P>As light in the Lord, we should walk as children of light (Eph. 5:8). God is light, and when we are in Him, we are in light. As those in the light we become children of light. Verse 15 tells us to walk not as unwise but as wise. Foolishness is a kind of darkness. When we walk foolishly, we are walking in darkness. When we walk wisely, we are walking in light. The children of light should walk, not as unwise but as wise, redeeming the time because the days are evil (v. 16). To redeem the time is to live in the church by Christ, to live Christ in the church life. If we do not live the church life, we will waste our time. Before we came to the church life, we wasted many years. To live outside the church life is to waste our time by living in vanity. You may consider that you do not have the time to pray for half an hour, but if a telephone call comes, you may talk for forty minutes in the vanity of your mind. Why would you not spend this time to pray for a certain brother who has been backsliding for years and never comes to the meetings? To pray for such a brother is to redeem your time. To talk on the telephone in the vanity of the mind is to waste your time. Time flies; it never waits for you. You have to redeem it by behaving wisely. To avoid unnecessary talk on the telephone is to redeem the time. Shopping may also be a waste of time. To live Christ for the church life is the unique way to redeem the time.</P><P>Verse 17 says, "Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is." The reason we might be foolish to waste our time by unnecessary shopping is that we do not know the will of the Lord. The will of the Lord is that we should visit the sinners. Why would we not use Saturday morning, afternoon, or evening to go to visit sinners? One brother among us told us about the practice of his grandfather, who was a baker in Germany working twelve hours a day starting from four in the morning. At four in the afternoon his grandfather would return home, wash and dress up, and go to visit people concerning Christ nearly every day. Wasn't that wise? Wasn't that the will of God? If we separated half of every Saturday to the Lord, forgetting about shopping, and went out to visit sinners, we could bring at least two or three to the Lord each year. Before going out, we should pray desperately, "Lord, I believe that in this city there are some dear ones chosen by You before the foundation of the world. Yet they still have not been called by You because there has been no one to sound Your call to them. Lord, send me to speak the gospel to them. Lord, be with me." If some of the saints did this, there would be an increase in the church.</P><P>In the past years, the poverty in fruitbearing has been among us in many places. After studying this matter for more than three years, I discovered that the best way to gain people is to go to them, to visit them by knocking on their doors. This practice has stirred up opposition in some places. This must be the attack of the enemy. Do you not believe that the Lord's will is for us to go out? The Lord Jesus charged us to go preach the gospel (Matt. 10:6-7; 28:19; Mark 16:15). He set up the pattern. He did not stay in the heavens, calling people to Himself. He came down to man and even became a man. He lowered Himself in position and status to go to Samaria to meet a sinful woman (John 4:1-42) and to go to Jericho to meet the sinner Zaccheus (Luke 19:1-10). He was always visiting people. Peter, Andrew, James, and John were also caught by the Lord's coming to visit them.</P><P>Two great heretical groups, the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses, also practice door-knocking. We must realize, though, that Satan always tries to copy what God is doing. It is regrettable that God's children do not go out to visit people. Instead, they may stay at home on Saturday to watch television and talk on the phone, or they may go shopping. After ten years, many Christians may not have brought one person to the Lord. Is this the Lord's will? We are the branches of the vine. The Lord's will is for all the branches to bear fruit. In John 15:16 the Lord said clearly, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain." He warned us that as the branches, we will be cut off if we do not bear fruit (John 15:2, 5-6). This is not to perish but to lose the very enjoyment of the rich vine. If we mean business with the Lord, our enjoyment of the Lord will bring forth fruit. However, where is the fruit today? We need to come back to the Word to read what the Lord's will is concerning this matter. If you read what the Lord's will is, you will be one who goes out to visit people.</P><P>Ephesians 5:18 says, "And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit." Every worldly thing that satisfies us is like wine. To go shopping to buy unnecessary things is wine. We should not be drunk with wine but be filled in our spirit with the dispensing Triune God. He is dispensing and we are drinking. When we are filled in our spirit with the dispensing Triune God, we speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and we are full of thanks and praises (vv. 19-20). Many have found out that when they went out to knock on people's doors and baptized someone, they were filled in this way.</P><P>Verse 21 says, "Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ." Christ as our Savior is the Head. Since He is the Head, we must learn to be subject to one another. Do not be the head over others. If we all take Christ as our Head and subject ourselves to Him, we will also subject ourselves to one another. The young ones should subject themselves to the older ones, and the older ones to the young ones. The older ones may feel superior and feel that the younger ones should listen to them. This is to not be subject to one another. This is to lord it over others, to be the head. All the older ones have to learn to subject themselves to the dear young ones. Children of light walking in love and light would surely be subject to one another. The older ones should consider that they would still like to learn something from the young ones, and that the younger ones may know more than they do.</P><P>In any society there is the age barrier. Teenagers may prefer not to be with those who are over twenty. Even among the teenagers, the seventeen and eighteen year olds may prefer not to be with the thirteen and fourteen year olds. There is the elementary school level, the junior high school level, and the high school level. If we are separated by age levels in the church, we are defeated. We all need to be like little children (Luke 18:17). The younger ones do not need to be afraid of the older ones. As an older one, I like to live, meet, and serve with the younger ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BECOMING THE BRIDE OF CHRIST</H2><P>As children of light walking in love and light, we will be prepared to be the bride of Christ. Christ is the Head of the church in authority and the Savior of the Body in love (Eph. 5:23). Christ's being the Head is a matter of authority, while His being the Savior is a matter of love. The church is subject to Christ as wives are to their husbands in everything (v. 24).</P><P>Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her (v. 25). Because He loved the church, Christ gave Himself up for her for the purpose of sanctifying her, not only positionally but also dispositionally, from without and from within. He sanctifies us by entering into us to be the sanctifying life and the holy nature that saturates us, cleansing us every day, even every moment, by the washing of the water in the Word (v. 26). In the Word, the Bible, there is the water. We know this by our experience. When we get into the water, it washes us. Every morning we need to wash in the Bible.</P><P>Christ sanctifies the church that He might present the church to Himself not only holy but also glorious for expressing God (v. 27). Glory is God expressed. A holy church is to express God, the holy One. A glorious church is to glorify God, to show God to others. Christ will present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things. Wrinkles are a sign of oldness. To have no wrinkles is a sign of youth. Spots represent wounds. Only the life from within can wash away the wrinkles, spots, and any such things. Verse 27 says that the church should be holy and without blemish, as a gem which bears a beautiful expression and has no foreign particles, or blemishes.</P><P>Christ nourishes and cherishes the church as His Body of which we are members (vv. 29-30). To nourish is to feed, and to cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care. When a baby is in the bosom of its mother, it is cherished. The baby enjoys the nurturing with tender love and the fostering with tender care. Christ is nourishing and cherishing us in the same way.</P><P>Christ and the church are one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17) as husband and wife are one flesh (Eph. 5:31). That Christ and the church are one is a great mystery (v. 32). The church came out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam (Gen. 2:21-22). Eve was the very issue, the enlargement, of Adam. The church has the same one life and nature as Christ and has become one with Him, as Eve became one flesh with Adam as his counterpart (Gen. 2:24), having the same life and nature as Adam had. According to life and nature, Adam and Eve were one. It is the same with Christ and us.</P><P>As we have seen, the church as the Body of Christ needs Christ as its life, and the new man needs Christ as his person. Moreover, the bride of Christ needs Christ as her love in the oneness of the two. Two can only become one in love. If there were no love between the two, they could never be one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WRESTLING FOR THE CHURCH AND<br>LOVING CHRIST IN INCORRUPTIBILITY</H2><P>Chapter six of Ephesians shows us that we need not only to wrestle for the church, but also to love Christ in incorruptibility (Eph. 6:11-18, 24). In the last chapter of Ephesians is the spiritual warfare. The church not only has to fight but also has to wrestle. If I did not wrestle, I would not be free to minister to you. We have to wrestle for the church. As the church we have to wrestle, to fight the good fight (2 Tim. 4:7). We must also love Christ in incorruptibility. The Triune God, God's dispensing, and the issue of this dispensing&#151;the church, the Body of Christ, the new man, and the bride&#151;are in incorruptibility. All other things in the universe will be corrupted. We must fight for the church and love Christ in this incorruptibility.</P></body></html>
