<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XII. THE PRAISE OF THE SAINT IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION<br>CONCERNING HIS HUMBLED HEART<br>AND QUIETED SOUL BEFORE JEHOVAH</H2><P>Psalm 131 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning his humbled heart and quieted soul before Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. His Heart Not Being Proud,<br>nor His Eyes Being Haughty</H2><P>In verse 1 the psalmist says that his heart is not proud, nor are his eyes haughty. He also says that he does not go about in things too great or too wondrous for him. Certain things are too great and wondrous for us, and we should not go about in these things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. He Having Calmed and Quieted<br>His Soul within Him</H2><P>The psalmist continues by saying that he has calmed and quieted his soul within him, like a weaned child with its mother (v. 2). He had been weaned, or stripped, of everything except the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Advising Israel, God's Chosen People,<br>to Hope in Jehovah</H2><P>The psalmist then advises Israel, God's chosen people, to hope in Jehovah from now to eternity (v. 3). When we have become like the psalmist, humble, calm, quiet, and weaned, we can advise others to hope in God.</P>
