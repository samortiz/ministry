<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Saying That God<br>Had Stripped His Glory from Him<br>and Had Taken Away the Crown on His Head</H2><P>In verse 9 Job said, "He has stripped my glory from me/And taken away the crown on my head." This was true. Job's glory was his perfection and uprightness, and his crown was his integrity. Job was right in saying that God had stripped his glory, his perfection and uprightness, from him and had taken away his crown, his integrity, from his head.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Saying That God Had Broken Him All Around</H2><P>Job further complained that God had broken him all around. Job was gone (dying), and his hope had been plucked up like a tree (v. 10). Job's hope had been to build up the "tree" of his integrity, but God would not allow such a tree to grow within Job. Rather, God had plucked up this tree, this hope.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Saying That God<br>Had Kindled His Anger against Him</H2><P>Job claimed that God had also kindled His anger against him and that in Himself He considered Job as His adversary. Job then said that God's troops had come together and had cast up their highway against him and had encamped all around his tent (vv. 11-12). Although God was stripping Job, He surely was not angry with him; neither did God consider Job as His adversary but as His intimate friend. Moreover, Job was not correct in saying that God had sent a troop against Job. For God to do such a thing would be against the principle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Saying That God<br>Had Removed His Brothers Far from Him</H2><P>Job continued his complaint by saying that God had removed his brothers far from him, and that those who knew him were wholly estranged from him. His relatives had failed him and his acquaintances had forgotten him, and those who sojourned in his house and his maids considered him a stranger. He was a foreigner in their eyes. Job said that he called out to his servant, but his servant did not answer (vv. 13-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Saying That His Breath Was Strange to His Wife</H2><P>Job said that his breath was strange to his wife, and his supplications, to the children of his mother's womb. Job complained that even little children despised him; he arose, and they spoke against him. All the men with whom he took counsel abhorred him, and those whom he loved had turned against him (vv. 17-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Saying That His Bones Cleaved<br>to His Skin and to His Flesh</H2><P>Job went on to say that his bones cleaved to his skin and to his flesh and that he had escaped by the skin of his teeth. He asked his friends to pity him, for, according to his feeling, the hand of God had touched him and God was persecuting him. Then, using a figure of speech, he asked them why they were not satisfied with eating his flesh (vv. 20-22).</P>
