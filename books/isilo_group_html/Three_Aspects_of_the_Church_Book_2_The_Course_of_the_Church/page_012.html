<p>Paul&rsquo;s old concepts were revealed not only in his second ministry journey but also in his third. When Paul was in Corinth during his third journey, he wrote a letter to the church in Rome and spoke of his feeling to go to Rome to visit the church there and from there to go to Spain (Rom. 1:15; 15:23-24, 28). This feeling is also mentioned in Acts 19:21. This was the will of the Holy Spirit related to the spread of the church. The Holy Spirit revealed to Paul that he should go west for the spread of the church.</p>
<p>On his third trip Paul went to many of the same places in Asia Minor, Macedonia, and Greece. He went back and forth to these few places and then returned to Antioch. Thus, in principle, Paul did not accomplish much for the spread of the church in his third journey. On his return from his third journey, he decided to pass through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem, and from there he would go to Rome. We must know that this was the will of the Holy Spirit. In Jerusalem he encountered some problems and was seized by the Jews (21:27-30).</p>
<p>Macedonia and Achaia were two Roman provinces on the Greek peninsula, in the eastern part of Europe. Further west were the peninsulas of Italy and Spain. The Greek culture was prevailing in the Roman Empire, but the center of the government was in Rome. The strongest influence was in Rome. Thus, Paul had an inward feeling that he should go to Rome. Moreover, Romans 15:23-24 and 28 show that he wanted to go to Spain. The word in Romans 15 and the word in Acts 19:21 were recorded around the same time; Paul felt he should go to Rome, and that after passing through Rome, he should go on to Spain. At that time, Spain was the uttermost part of the earth. If he had reached Spain, Paul would have been to all three major peninsulas in southern Europe.</p>
<p>We cannot lightly pass over these things; we must seriously consider them until we understand. The sense of the Holy Spirit in Paul was related to not merely arriving in Europe but spreading across Europe. Paul definitely had an inward feeling to cross over the Greek peninsula to Rome. Making such a trip would not be so difficult today, but in those days transportation was inconvenient. Consequently, the thought of making such a trip would not be common for Paul; it surely was the work of the Holy Spirit within him.</p>
<p>Before the apostles went to Macedonia, there were no churches there, but there was a church in Rome before Paul came. Many Bible scholars acknowledge that the church in Rome came from the Roman pilgrims in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. After they believed in the Lord, they returned to Rome and established the church there. Thus, the church in Rome probably began earlier than the churches in Macedonia. In other words, before the apostles came to Europe, there was already a church in Rome. The book of Romans was written by Paul on his third journey while he was in Corinth. At that time, Paul had the feeling that he should formally preach the gospel to the people in Rome. Romans 1:14-15 says that Paul wanted to go there to pay his debt of the gospel to the Gentiles. However, he still went from Corinth back to Jerusalem. On his third journey Paul did not merely fail to spread the churches; he did not carry out the feeling he had concerning the spreading. Whether or not Paul was right to return to Jerusalem, we will not say here, but once the spread of the church falls into human hands, it meets with difficulties. According to Acts 20 through 22, the church in Jerusalem was still in error. When Paul returned to Jerusalem, the believers exhorted him to return to the Jewish religion (21:23-25). Not long after, Paul was arrested while he was in the temple (v. 27). Paul should not have been in the temple; this was his weakness. This mistake was like Peter&rsquo;s weakness in Galatians 2. Paul was sympathetic with the weakness of others and thought that by going to the temple to make some offerings, the problems would pass away. He never thought that by going there, he himself would meet with difficulties.</p>
<p>The Bible records these things to show that in the matter of the church&rsquo;s spread, man and the Holy Spirit are frequently not in coordination with one another. Paul had the feeling to go to Rome and to Spain. He had a burden to go to the Gentiles and to not accommodate the Jewish religion. However, even Paul was weak. The church in Jerusalem in Acts 21 was full of the Jewish thought. In chapter 15 Paul fought a victorious battle for the church and solved the problem of Judaism. However, in chapter 21 he was still influenced to accommodate human weakness.</p>
<p>Our intention is not to condemn Paul but to clearly see the purpose of such a record in the Bible. The will of the Holy Spirit is for the church to continually spread. In Acts 1 the Lord&rsquo;s word is very clear: &ldquo;You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (v. 8). This verse shows what the extent of the church&rsquo;s spread should be. However, at every step the Holy Spirit encountered problems with man. On Paul&rsquo;s third journey he was undoubtedly weak; at the very least, it seems that there was not much glory. He should not have gone back; this was a great problem. On the one hand, he wanted to return to Jerusalem, but on the other hand, he had the inward feeling to go to Rome and Spain. Therefore, when Paul went to Jerusalem, it seems that it was not according to the Holy Spirit; rather, it was Paul&rsquo;s own idea.</p>
<p>There are differing views regarding Acts 21 and 22, and there are conflicts concerning their interpretation. Some say that Paul was right; others think that he was wrong. It is difficult to say for certain, but it is certain that the work of the Holy Spirit encountered problems with men. There are many twists in Paul&rsquo;s actions, and these twists are the result of human opinion. In studying church history, we should apply what we learn to ourselves, for today the same problems hinder the spread of the church. James spoke a word to Paul in Acts 21:20: &ldquo;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law.&rdquo; This word shows the extent of the influence of human opinions and viewpoints.</p>
<p>In Romans 15 Paul was clear that he should go to Rome and Spain. In Acts 19 Paul said again that he wanted to go to Rome. His feeling was very much related to the spread of the church, because the next step in spreading to Europe&mdash;after reaching Macedonia and Greece&mdash;was to go to Italy, and specifically to Rome. Then the following step would be to Spain. If the apostle had arrived in Spain, he would have thought that he was at the uttermost part of the earth.</p>
<p>Why, then, did Paul not go west but instead return to Jerusalem? Was his turning back to Jerusalem according to God&rsquo;s revelation? Acts does not record any revelation from the Holy Spirit telling him to go back; rather, it seems that in this move of the apostle there was some weakness. Romans 15:25-28 indicates that Paul went back because he was carrying the offerings from the churches in Macedonia and Greece to the saints in Jerusalem. Even though he said that he was going to Jerusalem and from there to Rome, for him to travel east from Corinth to Jerusalem and then west to Rome would have been very inconvenient.</p>
<p>When Paul wrote the book of Romans, he was full of care for Rome, and the Holy Spirit wanted him to go. However, he was held back by the inward entanglement of his fleshly relationship to the Jews. In Romans 9:3 Paul said, &ldquo;I could wish that I myself were a curse, separated from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.&rdquo; Perhaps his trip to Jerusalem was for his kinsmen according to the flesh. In other words, he had not entirely abandoned his Jewish concepts.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Paul was taking offerings to Jerusalem, he was seized soon afterward. This indicates that the offerings need not have been taken or distributed by him personally. In returning to Jerusalem, Paul took a step backward. It was not the way to Rome, where he really felt that he should be. Was there truly a need in the work for him to go to Jerusalem? We cannot see such a need for it in the Bible. The responsibility for the work in Judea had been entrusted to another group of apostles from the beginning. Paul&rsquo;s ministry was to the Gentiles. As an apostle to the Gentiles, he went backward, returning to his own country on behalf of his kinsmen according to the flesh. Humanly speaking this may be praiseworthy, but in the eyes of God it was absolutely not acceptable.</p>
<p>Paul wanted to arrive in Jerusalem before Pentecost (Acts 20:16), a Jewish feast. At Pentecost all the Jewish males had to go to Jerusalem to keep the feast; this was a very important feast. This feast was representative of Judaism. Although Paul was not going to Jerusalem to keep the feast, perhaps he wanted to use the feast as an opportunity to distribute the offerings to the believers from many places who would be in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>If this was the case, it shows that many Jewish believers of that time were still in the Jewish religion. Paul should have argued with them, telling them that it was wrong for Jewish believers to keep the Jewish ordinances, whether they lived in Gentile lands or in Jerusalem. Regardless of where they lived, none of them should have kept the Jewish ordinances. This is not a small matter. In any event, Paul had some weakness at that time. He should have rejected the environment of Pentecost, but he did not. The portion beginning in Acts 21:20 completely exposes his weakness.</p>
<p>At that time, the Jewish believers were in the temple making vows and offering sacrifices. With James and all the elders present (v. 18), Paul was persuaded to participate in things that he had condemned in the book of Galatians. Paul taught people not to keep the law, but he pretended to keep it in front of others. From Acts 21 the work of spreading the church met with difficulty from the old, nationalistic concepts of men.</p>
<p>After the conference in Jerusalem in Acts 15, it seemed as if the church had settled things once and for all concerning the matter of Judaism, but in chapter 21 the church opened a back door to again accept Judaism. The Jewish believers were still keeping the law; in the morning perhaps they prayed by virtue of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood, but in the afternoon they could still offer up sacrifices of bulls and rams. They wanted both Christ and the law. They wanted the Spirit and the ordinances.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, it was wrong for Paul to go to Jerusalem. We dare not say that it was a sin, but it was certainly a weakness. If Paul had not been seized at that time, his offering of sacrifices would have confused the Gentile brothers when they heard about it. The line between the Old and New Testament dispensations, between the law and grace, would have been blurred. Therefore, it was certainly wrong for Paul to go back there.</p>
<p>Paul felt bound in his spirit before this matter (20:22). Positively speaking, he knew in his spirit what would happen to him when he went ahead. In 21:11 the Holy Spirit warned him through Agabus&rsquo;s prophecy not to proceed. However, Paul did not listen to the warning. Even when the saints pleaded with him, he did not listen (vv. 4, 12). This was an independent action. In this instance Paul went against his own feeling and the feeling of the Body. He ignored the warning from the Holy Spirit, and he did not receive the exhortations of the saints. This was wrong. The Holy Spirit told him to go west, but he turned and went east. For the sake of his kinsmen according to the flesh, he was willing to be cut off from Christ, Rome, and Spain (Rom. 9:3). This was because of Paul&rsquo;s old, human concept.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s return to Jerusalem went against five instances of feeling and teaching concerning the matter. First, the Holy Spirit gave him a positive feeling, but he did not obey it. Second, the Holy Spirit gave him a restricting feeling, but again he did not listen. In every move, if we do not feel the flow, there is a problem with what we are doing. Third, Agabus gave him a prophetic warning, but Paul did not listen. Fourth, he went against the feeling of the Body. Fifth, he went against the clear word of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. The Lord said that if there is persecution in one city, we should leave it and flee to another city (Matt. 10:23). Paul did not need to return to Jerusalem, he did not have any great purpose in going there, and there were sufferings awaiting him there. His insistence on going was related entirely to his old, natural concepts.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
