   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CHRIST AND THE BELIEVERS BECOMING ONE ORGANISM Scripture Reading: John 15:1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 16 THE VINE AND THE BRANCHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 15 is a most mysterious chapter, yet because the illustration is so simple, we may not really catch its significance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus said, "I am the vine, you are the branches" v. 5 . Such a statement implies that He and we are one tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could this be possible?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is God and we are sinful human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How could we be one with the almighty God?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To liken the relationship between the Lord and us to a vine and its branches is to imply a living, organic relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A vine is not constructed by man; it grows and develops according to its life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man may build a chair, for instance, in whatever style suits him; he is free to choose the material to be used, the shape, and the way the parts will be attached.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John writes of a vine, however, something which is not designed nor arranged by man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul writes of a Body, also a living organism not subject to man's rearranging.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do we have a better place to locate our nose?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Can we assign it a different function from what it has?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you ever thought of the Lord Jesus as a vine and of yourself as a branch?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is time to consider this!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How could you be one with the Lord Jesus in life?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is without sin; you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is divine; you are human.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You were a poor branch from a poor tree, but one day you believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through believing you were grafted into this better vine!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You were not merely attached in some outward way by joining.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are not like a denture, fitted in but not really belonging.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are like a living tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Years ago I had a denture of two teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After using it for a few weeks, I threw it away.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every time I ate I had to be on guard lest the teeth come loose and fall into my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was afraid I would swallow them along with my food!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have been grafted into Christ, not artificially added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will never discard you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>HOW THE LORD MADE US ONE WITH HIM</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are to understand how we and the Lord Jesus could be the same in life and nature as a vine and its branches and could indwell each other, we must relate John 15 with the foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These earlier chapters tell us that the Lord Jesus was the Word in the beginning and that the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day this One who in eternity past was God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He lived on this earth and went about with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For three and a half years they had Him with them and enjoyed His company.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then to their surprise they heard Him say that He was going away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He would die and be resurrected so that He might become the Spirit and be able to enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Christ entered into the disciples, He made them the same as He.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He imparted into them the divine life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By His death and resurrection He became the living Spirit, able to enter into all those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We ourselves can testify that this is not a superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we had a sense of something entering into us and of our having been put into something.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be saved is more than to have our sins forgiven and be justified by God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is to have something living, holy, and divine the Spirit come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It made us feel as happy as the birds flying in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also sensed that we no longer belonged to this earth, even though we were still living here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We were put into a living One, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can we be the same as He?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How can we be in Him and He in us?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider again the illustration of grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To attach a branch to another tree and have them grow together and become one is possible because they are both living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They do not stay together because of nails or glue.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as they are brought together and attached, they will grow together into one organism.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This comes about by life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can grow into Christ and have Him grow in us by life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is by this Spirit that we have been grafted into Christ and that Christ can be worked into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now deep in our spirit we sense that Christ is one with us and that in spirit we are one with Him.</S>
