   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RAISING UP OF MEN WHO TURN THE AGE FOR THE RECOVERY OF GOD'S AUTHORITY AND EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It was at this juncture that Daniel was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through Daniel's being raised up, God's people returned from Babylon to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who returned to Jerusalem were of two lines.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One was the line of authority, which included men like Nehemiah and Zerubbabel who were David's descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among them were also some governors.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The other line was the line of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These men expressed God's glory in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Men like Ezra and Joshua, the high priest, were Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, their return was a recovery of authority and expression as at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One matter was to rule for God, because among David's descendants rulers such as the governors were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The other was the expression of God, because there was a return to the priestly and Levitical services of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In relating these matters, it is not my intention to tell some Bible stories.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My only wish is that among the young brothers and sisters here, some would realize what is happening in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we realize what is happening in the universe, we will easily receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will realize that in the present age also, God needs someone to rise up and to turn the age as Samuel and Daniel did.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should agree that the condition of today's age is like that of Babel and Babylon and that God's authority is denied on earth and His expression torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In these days the whole world is celebrating Christmas.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Look how they celebrate!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Outwardly, they are celebrating the holy birth of Jesus Christ, but actually, they are in the flesh and indulging in their lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No dancing in the world is worse than the dancing on so-called Christmas Eve!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>People even call such a dancing party "the holy party"!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is how men celebrate Christ's "birthday"!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only do the Gentiles behave this way, but even many Christians also are carried away by the tide of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many send Christmas cards to each other, greet each other with "Merry Christmas," set up trees at home, and hang little light bulbs on them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems that if they do not do these things, they will not be fashionable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am afraid that among the young brothers and sisters, some have also done this in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please remember that all these are fallen things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today all of Christianity has fallen into Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is not a trace of God's ruling, not a trace of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is altogether a condition of men forsaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In such a desolate age, God needs young people to rise up to turn the age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>MEN WHO TURN THE AGE BEING THOSE WHO CONSECRATE THEMSELVES VOLUNTARILY</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let us now take a look at Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How did God use Daniel to turn that age?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is an important principle with Daniel as also with Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is voluntary consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Samuel was a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A Nazarite was a person who consecrated himself voluntarily Num 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can see the same principle in Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Apparently Daniel was not a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually he was, because a Nazarite was a person who did not drink any wine or strong drink.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is the meaning of not drinking wine or strong drink?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It means not to enjoy any pleasures of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the principle with Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Daniel would have said, "I do not want anything that the world considers sweet, joyous, or satisfying."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why did Daniel drink neither wine nor strong drink, nor partake of the king s diet?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is because all these things were related to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What the king of Babylon drank, as well as his meat and grains, must have been offered to the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At least those meals were not clean according to the ordinances on cleanliness in Leviticus 11; it was defiled food.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Daniel said, "I will not be defiled by that food.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The young people of the world may participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But I will not have a part in it."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In principle, Daniel and Samuel were the same; both were Nazarites.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Daniel refused everything that men enjoyed and boasted of.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He refused everything that would offer him some position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He was a voluntarily consecrated one.</S>
