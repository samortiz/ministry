<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(63)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 22, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY BROTHER G. R.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family. When I was young I became sick and sought for healing from the idols. After I became well, I was given to one idol to be its adopted son. Later I learned the trade of dressmaking. I became tired of life and considered becoming a monk. I saw many nominal Christians whose walk did not deserve their name, and I despised Christianity, refusing to believe in Jesus. Our entire family worshipped idols. When my first two sons became ill, I prayed to the idols. But both of them died. I became angry with the idols and gave them up. I burned all the images and things related to the idols. Once I went to a gospel meeting and heard that there is God and that man has a soul. I accepted the Lord Jesus. When the Japanese invaded China, I moved inland. Once, I received the promise of Psalm 91.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Spiritual Understanding Not Yet Opened</h2><p>You should ask why your spirit is so weak. You have experienced many things but have learned few lessons. You are still very weak. You must not only find the reason for your weakness but the way of deliverance. If you remain self-assured, self-justifying, and hard, your experience will not result in God's breaking, and you will not receive any good. Perhaps you are unable to have much spiritual knowledge and understanding and are unable to take advantage of your environment because of the lack of supply from the ministry. In all your experiences in your environment, you only found yourself related to the things themselves, not to the God who ordered the environment. This is the reason all of your experiences have flown away one by one in a meaningless fashion. Those whose spiritual understanding is opened will reap spiritual result in everything they encounter.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lack of Supply<br />from the Ministry of the Word</h2><p>Our brother's experiences are merely outward events to him; they have not become spiritual lessons to him. If a man's spiritual understanding is enlightened, he may not know what an event means at the time it happens. After a while, however, he will know that God's hand is behind it. The problem with our brother is that he is short of the supply of the ministry of the word. He has encountered many things, but he remains weak and has not learned many spiritual lessons. We can see that the ministry of the word is very much related to the way a man runs the race. If a man has spiritual understanding, he can turn worldly things into spiritual things. In order to understand the discipline of the Holy Spirit, a man first must have spiritual understanding. Only then can he be brought into the spiritual realm.</p><p>I hope that from now on our brother will see God's mighty hand in everything great or small. I hope that he will not oppose the Lord but submit to Him instead. Once he submits, his spiritual understanding will be enlightened, and his spirit will be strong. Our brother must also learn to accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit. As soon as our spiritual understanding is enlightened, our experiences will turn into spiritual blessings. Otherwise, we will waste our experiences and live our life in vain.</p>
