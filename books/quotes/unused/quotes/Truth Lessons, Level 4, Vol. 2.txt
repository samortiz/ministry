After one thousand years Satan will be released from the abyss to deceive the nations, which are in the four corners of the earth
The deceived nations will surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire will come down out of heaven and will devour them
The devil, who deceived them, will be cast into the lake of fire, thus eternally clearing up the rebellion of Satan
We will begin by looking at Enoch's prophecy and Noah's prophecies concerning his three sons-Shem, Ham, and Japheth-in Genesis
His prophecies have also had a far-reaching effect on God's elect, Israel and the church, and on the development of the world situation
By naming his son Methuselah, Enoch prophesied of the coming of the flood to destroy the living things on the earth
Methuselah begot Lamech when he was one hundred eighty-seven years old , and Lamech begot Noah when he was one hundred eighty-two years old
By naming his son Methuselah, Enoch prophesied concerning the flood that came in the year that Methuselah died
Verse 14 says, 'Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied also of these, saying, Behold, the Lord came with myriads of His saints'
Enoch's prophecy must have influenced his living and caused him to live a godly and holy life by faith in midst of an ungodly generation
According to the record of Genesis, after the flood Noah became the leader on the new land and the father of all mankind on the earth
Noah's offering satisfied God, so 'God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth
Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon their shoulders, and they walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father
Since God had established him as the leader, Noah had to speak, not according to his feeling of conviction but according to God's government
He took care of God's government and God's economy on the earth and represented God to speak a strong governmental word
Japheth became the forefather of the Europeans, and according to Noah's prophecy, Japheth would be enlarged by God
Over five hundred years ago, Columbus ventured to sail across the Atlantic, and he reached a new continent, America
The Jewish land of Palestine is in the center of these three inhabited sections Europe to the north Africa to the south and Asia to the east
Babylon followed Assyria to conquer Israel, destroy Jerusalem, burn down the temple, and exile the great majority of the children of Israel
All the things concerning God, concerning God's gospel, concerning Christ, and concerning salvation have come out of the Jews
On the one hand Rome conquered and captured Palestine but on the other hand Rome prepared a good environment for the Lord Jesus to be born
On the one hand, the strong nation of Rome persecuted and even crucified Christ, and it also persecuted and martyred the apostles
On the other hand, through this strong empire the way was prepared for Christ to be born and crucified and for the gospel to be preached
Imperialism is the policy and practice of maintaining an empire through the conquest and domination of weaker countries
According to God's sovereignty, regardless of how much Japheth has been enlarged, he still needs to dwell in the tents of Shem
For Japheth to worship God, he must believe in the God of Shem and receive rest, peace, enjoyment, and salvation in the tents of Shem
When he was sixty-five years old, he bore a son and named him Methuselah, which means 'when he is dead, it will be sent'
The coming of the flood was the first fulfillment, and the second fulfillment will be at the manifestation of the Lord's parousia
His prophecies have also had a far-reaching effect on God's elect, Israel and the church, and on the development of the world situation
Because Shem and Japheth respected God's government, they did not see their father's nakedness; rather, they covered their father's failure
He prophesied that Jehovah would be the God of Shem and that Japheth would be enlarged and would dwell in the tents of Shem
Abraham was a definite beginning for God's people, and the nation of Israel was also a definite beginning for God's people
Without Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, there would not be the nation of Israel, and there would not be a people of God in the Old Testament
The New Testament believers, both Jews and Gentiles, who become sons of Abraham through faith in Christ 'are blessed with believing Abraham'
Since the Spirit is God Himself, this means that God promised that He would give Himself to Abraham as the blessing
In His promise God made another turn from Abraham to all the families of the adamic race through Christ, the seed of Abraham
God not only gave Himself to Abraham as a blessing, but He also made Abraham a blessing to all the pitiful people of the adamic race
In this way, all the called ones from among the Gentiles have been brought back to God and have gained God as their blessing
The three items of Gods promise were to make Abraham a great nation to bless him and to make him a blessing to all the families of the earth
After a person repents for the kingdom, he needs to believe so that he may have eternal life, which is in the Spirit
The nation is a matter of dominion to represent God, and the blessing is a matter of image in the Spirit to express God
In these verses, however, God promised in a definite way that the seed would be Isaac and that Isaac would be born of Sarah
The land was also a place in which Abraham could defeat all his enemies so that God could have a kingdom on earth
Eventually, the kingdom of God was established, the temple was built for God's habitation, and the glory of God was manifested in the land
We, the Christians, are the stars, the heavenly descendants of Abraham, and the genuine Jews, God's earthly people, are the sand, the dust
Although the Jews are an earthly people, they are not the dust under the sea, but the dust, the sand, on the seashore
The people represented by the apostles are the heavenly stars, and those represented by the twelve tribes are the sand on the seashore
Ishmael's mocking of Isaac was the beginning of the affliction of Abraham's seed that was to continue for four hundred years
Before the children of Israel were tested in the wilderness for forty years, they already had been tested for four hundred years
From Ishmael's persecution of Isaac, the promised seed, until the exodus out of Egypt was a period of four hundred years
God promised that Abraham's seed would be given a spacious land, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates
In typology this means that after all the experiences of affliction, God's people will be expanded and become spacious
God's blessing of Abraham eventually issues in Christ as the unique seed in whom all the nations of the earth will be blessed
Ultimately, all the descendants of Abraham, including the heavenly stars and the sand on the seashore, will be in Christ
In this kingdom God can be fully expressed in the seed, into which He will impart Himself and which will be transformed into His image
Through the enjoyment of grace the kingdom of God will be realized, and God in Christ will be fully expressed for eternity
God promised that Isaac, the promised seed of Abraham, would be the one in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed
After a certain amount of time there will be thirtyfold, then sixtyfold, and then a hundredfold increase in the church
God made another promise to Jacob saying A nation and a company of nations shall come from you And kings shall come forth from your loins
God promised Abraham that He would make of him a great nation, make his name great, and make him the father of a great nation
Although this seed would suffer affliction, being afflicted for four hundred years, they would return to the land of Canaan
The first item that God promised Jacob is that God would be the All-sufficient God and that Jacob would be fruitful and multiply
God also promised Jacob that a nation and a company of nations would come from him and that kings would come out of his loins
According to the record in Genesis, the human race began with Adam and continued with Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Jacobs words to his twelve sons are what their father spoke to them when he blessed them he blessed them each one according to his blessing
Jacob's first six prophecies concern Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, and Issachar-the sons born of Leah, Jacob's proper wife
In verse 3 Jacob said Reuben you are my firstborn My might and the firstfruits of my vigor Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power
Because Reuben was corrupted and defiled, in his prophecy with blessing Jacob specifically changed Reuben's status by birth as the firstborn
Anyone among the people of Israel who killed a person by mistake could easily flee to one of these cities of refuge
The phrase from the prey, my son, you have gone up means that the lion has gone up the mountain to devour his prey
Isaiah 2:2-3 and 11:10 indicate that from the beginning of the millennium, at the Lord's second coming, all the nations will obey Christ
Although a donkey is usually used for labor in travel, the donkey in Genesis 49:11 is not laboring; it is bound to the vine
Not only so, after His resurrection He met with the disciples again in Galilee and said to them, 'Go therefore and disciple all the nations'
Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the sea, and he will be a shore for ships to ship out the gospel of the kingdom
The early preachers all sailed from the Holy Land to Asia Minor and then across the Aegean Sea to Greece, Rome, and Spain
The history of preaching the gospel to the Gentile world in Acts fulfills the prophecy that Zebulun's 'flank will be toward Sidon'
Through the enjoyment of these riches they become willing to bow their shoulder take up a burden and serve for tribute rendered to the King
These prophecies are the conclusion of the book of Genesis and are developed in the remainder of the Old Testament and in the New Testament
Jacob's prophecies are not related only to his twelve sons; they are also closely related to the experience of the New Testament believers
The first six sons mentioned in Jacobs prophecies are Reuben Simeon Levi Judah Zebulun and Issacharthe sons born of Leah Jacobs proper wife
By birth Reuben was the firstborn, but because he was corrupted and defiled, Jacob prophesied that he would not have the preeminence
Eventually, the double portion of the land was given to Joseph, the kingship was given to Judah, and the priesthood was given to Levi
Judah would also be rich in wine and milk; his labor would be over, and his rest in rich enjoyment would begin
Zebulun would dwell at the shore of the sea and would be a shore for ships to ship out the gospel of the kingdom
Jacob's word meant not only that Dan would remain as a tribe but also that Dan would be a scepter, an authority
The tribe of Dan not only set up a divisive center of worship in the good land but also appointed and hired their own priests
Because of the failure of Dan, Jacob prophesied in Genesis 49:19, saying, 'Gad, raiders will raid him, / But he will raid at their heel'
After Christ was risen, He gathered the disciples together and charged them, saying, 'Go therefore and disciple all the nations,
Genesis 49:22 says, 'Joseph is a fruitful bough, / A fruitful bough by a fountain; / His branches run over the wall'
At that time in Egypt Joseph was not simply branching out personally; he was branching out God's administration with seventy people
Throughout the centuries, all those who have loved the Lord and who have been occupied with Him have also been fruitful
Joseph, a type of Christ, as part of Jacob the fruitful father, was a bough of the fruitful tree and also a branch that branches out
Joseph was not limited to the good land; he ran over the wall into Egypt, spreading beyond the limits of the good land into another region
In typology this indicates that the children of God are spreading Christ over every restriction and magnifying Him in every circumstance
Genesis 49:25 says, 'From the God of your father, who will help you, / And from the All-sufficient One, who will bless you'
The One who dwelt in the bush dwelt in the temple; now He dwells in the church, and eventually, He will dwell in the New Jerusalem
Christ, typified by Joseph, was the One separate from His brothers , and as such, He has received the blessing of the whole universe
His father changed his name to Benjamin, which means 'son of the right hand' and signifies the ascended and exalted Christ
Genesis 49:27 says, 'Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, / In the morning devouring the prey / And in the evening dividing the spoil'
The ascended and exalted Christ is not only the overcoming One but also the tearing One, the One who eats His enemy
The fact that Jacob could prophesy in such a way is a strong sign and manifestation that he was matured in life
Opposers and the enemy have raised up walls to restrict the fruitfulness of God's children, but the branches run over the wall every time
Concerning Benjamin Jacob prophesied that he was a ravenous wolf In the morning devouring the prey And in the evening dividing the spoil
The ascended and exalted Christ is not only the overcoming One but also the tearing One, the One who eats His enemy
After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel were formed into an army to fight for God on their journey
After the children of Israel defeated these three kings, they were ready to cross the Jordan and enter into the good land
Balak, the king of Moab, joined with Midian and sent elders to induce Balaam to come and curse the children of Israel for them
Balaam had the desire and intention in his heart to curse Israel so that he might please Balak and receive money
As the One who was watching and ruling, however, Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and Balaam had no choice but to speak God's word
In the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the Bamoth-baal, and he saw from there the edge of the people'
He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar'
One of the most striking lines in this parable is in verse 21: 'He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, / Nor has He seen trouble in Israel'
It is obvious that the children of Israel had many iniquities, but God does not look at what His redeemed people are in themselves
The second parable concludes in verse 24, saying, 'See, a people rises up like a lioness, / And like a lion they lift themselves up
When Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go as at the other times to meet with enchantments'
Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him
In this age the Jews are not welcomed by the nations, but they will be welcomed by the nations after the Lord Jesus comes back
Aloe is a plant known for its healing effect; the Lord Jesus was buried in linen with a mixture of myrrh and aloes
After the coming back of the Lord Jesus, Israel will be a healing to the nations, and that healing will be a great blessing
As the New Testament indicates, this prophecy will be fully fulfilled in the coming days, that is, in the millennium
Balaam spoke four parables to Israel in which there are many prophecies concerning the house of Israel, the nations, and the Messiah
The first parable speaks of the children of Israel being a people who live alone and who do not reckon themselves among the nations
It is obvious that the children of Israel had many iniquities, but God does not look at what His redeemed people are in themselves
In God's eyes His people have been redeemed and forgiven; therefore, God can say that they are without iniquity
In the third parable Balaam said that the tents of Jacob are fair, and the tabernacles of Israel are beautiful
Israel will be like valleys that spread forth, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by Jehovah, and like cedars beside water
Because of their unbelief at Kadesh-barnea, God caused them to turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea
By so doing, they would be able to gain the victory, riches, blessings, and inheritance in the promised good land
As commanded by God, Moses also made a covenant with the children of Israel who were about to enter into the good land
Finally, they would be cursed in being scattered among all the nations and in living a life of captivity, full of terrors
They would also be brought back to Egypt, where they would offer themselves for sale to their enemies, but no one would buy them
He would put all the curses upon their enemies, give them an excess of prosperity in all their undertakings, and exult over them for good
Moses called heaven and earth to witness against the children of Israel because he had set before them life and death, blessing and curse
He was to be their life and the length of their days so that they might dwell upon the land which He swore to their fathers to give them
After the children of Israel entered into the good land, they forsook Jehovah their God by rebelling against the covenant of God
God will renew His blessing on the land and send the early and late rain so that the land changes from desolateness to fertility
When we see these things taking place, we will know that the summer, which signifies the age of the restoration, is near
He knew that after He brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, they would eat and become satisfied and grow fat
Jehovah saw their actions and held them in contempt because He was provoked to anger by His sons and daughters
They were not wise and were unable to comprehend that it was Jehovah their Rock who sold them and delivered them up to their enemies
He would avenge the blood of His servants, repay His adversaries with vengeance, and cover the guilt of His land and of His people
Even today, many of them are still turned away from God to the idols of money, advanced technology, weapons, and skills in fighting
She will remain until the Lord Jesus comes again as the lightening comes forth from the east and shines to the west
God also used these thirty-eight years to produce a new generation, training them and preparing them to enter into the good land
At the same time, God also commanded Moses to write a song to review the past and prophesy concerning the future
Moses called heaven and earth to witness against them because he had set before them life and death, blessing and curse
He also exhorted them to choose life in loving Jehovah their God by listening to His voice and holding fast to Him
Deuteronomy 33 speaks of the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death
Moses' prophecy concerning Reuben in Deuteronomy 33:6 says, 'May Reuben live and not die, / Nor his men be few'
As the firstborn son of Jacob, Reuben should have received the birthright, but he sinned and lost the birthright
In Deuteronomy 33:7, concerning Judah, Moses said, 'Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, / And bring him to his people'
Moses said that Jehovah's Thummim and Urim would be with His faithful men, with whom He contended at the waters of Meribah
Concerning his father and mother, Levi said, 'I do not regard him,' and he did not acknowledge his brothers nor recognize his children
God's Thummim and Urim were with him, and he had the privilege of coming into the presence of God to serve Him
Although the double portion of the land inherited by Joseph is rich, the privilege of entering God's presence enjoyed by Levi is intimate
In the entire Old Testament there is no higher, greater, or sweeter blessing than the blessing of God's dwelling place
In the New Testament the Lord Jesus became flesh and tabernacled among God's people, full of grace and reality
The expression Him who dwelt in the thornbush refers to God, who in Exodus 3 appeared to Moses from within a burning thornbush
For centuries the inhabitants of cold regions have been trying to spread south to the Mediterranean Sea, including Jerusalem
Eventually, Christ at His coming back as the strong ox will come with two horns and push them back to the northern region
The crucial center of international relations today is the Middle East, and many nations want to spread into that region
Most of the apostles who were sent forth to disciple the nations were produced from Zebulun, which was in the region of Galilee
The Galileans went out with the glad tidings of the victory of Christ, bearing the word of the victorious, restful, and productive Christ
Verse 19 says, 'They shall call peoples to the mountain; / There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness'
In the millennial kingdom all the peoples, the nations, will be called through preaching to God's kingdom in Mount Zion

In Deuteronomy 33:19 Moses also said that Zebulun and Issachar would 'suck the abundance of the seas / And the hidden treasures of the sand'
Because the tribe of Gad was rather small, when Moses blessed them prophetically, he said, 'Blessed be He who enlarges Gad'
Concerning Gad verse 21 says, 'He provided the first part for himself, / For there the portion of a lawgiver is reserved'
In their journey into the good land, the twelve tribes first entered the land that was on the east side of the Jordan
Although Moses agreed, he charged them not to enjoy their land while their brothers had not yet obtained their portion of the land
Moses charged them to fight the battle for the rest of the good land , after which the remaining tribes would receive their inheritance
Deuteronomy 3321 also says He came with the heads of the people He executed the righteousness of Jehovah And His judgments with Israel
In blessing Naphtali, Moses spoke of this tribe as being satisfied with favor and filled with the blessing of the Lord
According to Moses' prophecy, Asher would be blessed above the sons; he would be the one favored of his brothers

When the children of Israel were about to enter into the land of Canaan, God charged them through Moses to slaughter all the Canaanites
After entering into the good land, they failed God and eventually were divided into the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel
Most of these prophecies have an initial and partial fulfillment as well as a further and complete fulfillment
God asked the elders among the people of Israel to hear this message, and He asked all the inhabitants of the land to give heed to it
They were to tell their children about it, their children were to tell their children, and those children were to tell the next generation

Throughout the entire human history, these four empires have always been the center in God's dealing with Israel
Joel prophesied that a nation would come up against the land of Jehovah, devour the people, and make the land a desolation
Until today, this devastating from the nations is still happening to God's chosen people, the nation of Israel
The ministry of Amos the prophet was during the end of the reign of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, about 787 B
Amos was not a prophet originally, nor was he the son of a prophet; rather, he was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamores
Jehovah sought out their transgressions and punished them, sending fire upon Judah and devouring the palaces of Jerusalem
Even when the reign of Uzziah the king of Judah was strong, Amos perceived that the tabernacle of the family of David would fall
He reigned for forty-one years and restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of Arabah
The sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat had not been removed, the standard of morality was poor, and sins and transgressions increased
Sadly, even though Jeroboam the son of Joash was successful in politics and military affairs, he failed in spiritual matters
Though not much happened during his reign, fifty years later the judgment of God came, and the kingdom of Israel was destroyed
He wanted to show Israel that the prophet's taking a wife of harlotries symbolized the relationship between God and His apostate people
God was forced to declare 'Lo-ruhamah' and 'Lo-ammi,' meaning 'she has not obtained compassion' and 'not My people'
After Hosea took Gomer as his wife she bore a son called Jezreel then a daughter called Loruhamah and after that another son called Loammi
The name Jezreel indicated that in yet a little while Jehovah would avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu
Gomer the wife of Hosea conceived a second time and bore a daughter whom Jehovah called Loruhamah meaning she has not obtained compassion
The prophecies included in these two names were fulfilled in the fall of the kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Hoshea
From that time Israel has been without king, without prince, and without their worship of offering sacrifices to God
God needed a man to defeat His enemy Babylon, who had taken His people captive and had destroyed His holy temple

The first four nationsAmmon Moab Edom and Philistiaform the first group Tyre and Sidon make up the second group and Egypt stands alone
These nations are divided into these three groups because Ezekiel saw three separate visions at three different times concerning them
His first vision covers the first four nations; his second vision, Tyre and Sidon; and his third vision, Egypt
In addition, they exercised their wisdom to develop their natural resources in order to become rich and have an abundant supply
Egypt represents persons who exercise their natural wisdom and develop their natural resources in order to be rich and have a supply
The first result of Gods judgment upon the nations was that all the nations as well as Israel would come to know that He is the Lord Jehovah
Sidon was a pricking briar or a painful thorn to the house of Israel, and they damaged the life of God's people

Daniel 2:34-35 says, 'A stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the image at its feet of iron and clay and crushed them
Christ will come with His bride, composed of the overcomers, and Antichrist will be with the ten kings and their armies
The great human image will be replaced with a great mountain, which signifies the eternal kingdom of God that will fill the whole earth
When Christ comes to crush the totality of human government, He will usher in the eternal kingdom of God on earth
If God's people see this controlling vision, they will be kept from the world and prepared for Christ's coming
In Nebuchadnezzar's dream human government on the earth was signified by a great human image full of glory and splendor
The eagle wings signify that the beast was in the air, which belongs to Satan, the ruler of the air, and that its move was swift

According to biblical interpretation, in verses 24 through 27 one week does not refer to seven days but to seven years
If the seventy weeks were to refer to seventy times seven days, there would not be an appropriate explanation for this portion of the Word
In the middle of that week, that is, after three and a half years, Antichrist will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease
In His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit to germinate those whom God has chosen and make them a new creation
If we see the issue of Christ's death on the cross, we will realize that the word in Daniel 9:26 about the death of Christ is good news
The last part of Daniel 9:26 says, 'The end of it will be with a flood, and even to the end there will be war; desolations are determined'
Between the sixty-ninth week and the last week, there is a gap, which has already lasted for nearly two thousand years
The history of Israel is physical, with nothing of a mysterious nature, but the history of the church is altogether mysterious
In this gap the children of Israel have been suffering, having lost their fathers' homeland and having been scattered to all the earth
In the middle of the seventieth week Antichrist will change his mind, fight against God, and cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease
During the great tribulation, both the faithful Jews and the Christians still on earth will suffer Antichrist's persecution
After he causes the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, Antichrist will replace them with the abominations of the desolator
The end of Daniel 9:27 says, 'Until the complete destruction that has been determined is poured out upon the desolator'
Daniel understood the seventy weeks, but because we are near to the end of the gap, we understand this matter even better than Daniel
By studying the vision of the seventy weeks in relation to Gods economy we know where we are who we are and what we should be doing today
Even though the environment would be extremely distressful, Jerusalem would be rebuilt, with street and trench

Eventually, the last week of seven years will come, and Antichrist will make a firm covenant with the people of Israel for one week
In the middle of the seventieth week, Antichrist will change his mind, fight against God, and cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease
During these three and a half years, Antichrist will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with the abominations of the desolator
Eventually, as prophesied by Daniel, the complete destruction that has been determined will be poured out upon the desolator, Antichrist
In this lesson we will begin to study the prophecies concerning God's promise to restore Israel, starting with the prophecies in Isaiah
The northern kingdom of Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, the southern kingdom, nor will Judah be hostile toward Ephraim
He will also change the situation on the earth and open the way from Assyria to the Holy Land for the children of Israel to return
The tongue of the sea of Egypt, that is, the Gulf of Suez, which frustrates the traffic from Egypt to the Holy Land, will be destroyed
God will use scorching heat from the wind to dry up the Euphrates into seven streams so that the children of Israel can walk through it
Isaiah was burdened for the arm of Jehovah to do the same thing in his day so that the captives of Israel could be brought back
Isaiah 52:8 says that Jehovah will restore Zion, and 62:6-9 says that Jerusalem will be established and made a praise in the earth
According to Isaiah 61:4-9 and Zechariah 8:20-23, during the millennium, the thousand-year kingdom, the restored Israel will be priests
Salvation will come to the daughter of Zion, and the people will be called the holy people, the redeemed of Jehovah
In the coming restoration the all-inclusive Christ will be beauty and glory in His divinity to the children of Israel
He will also be their excellence and splendor in His humanity that expresses the beauty and glory of His divinity
Previously, the children of Israel were not faithful, but Israel will become a righteous nation that maintains faithfulness
The heart of the hasty will understand knowledge, and the tongue of those who stammer will hasten to speak elegantly
The work of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever
During that time, righteousness will work out peace, and the result of righteousness will be quietness and assurance forever
Isaiah 60:15-18 reveals that in her restoration, Israel will be made an eternal excellency and a joy for generations
Even God Himself will exult in Jerusalem and rejoice in His people, and there will no longer be heard in her the voice of weeping and crying
In the restoration an infant will not die before reaching maturity, and one who dies at the age of a hundred will be regarded as a youth
Isaiah 6019 refers to the time of Israels restoration when Christ as the Servant of Jehovah will be the glory of Jehovah arising upon Israel
Today we offer sinners as sacrifices to God but in the restoration the nations will bring the scattered Israelites as a meal offering to God
Just as in the Old Testament time, some will be appointed to serve as priests, and others will do the Levitical service
Jehovah will glean the children of Israel from the flowing stream of the River unto the brook of Egypt, like the beating out of the grain
Jehovah will create a canopy over Zion and her convocations and will provide His chosen people with a tabernacle
In His days Judah will be saved And Israel will dwell securely And this is His name by which He will be called Jehovah our righteousness
Jeremiah prophesied that Christ would come as a Shoot, who is Jehovah Himself, to be the righteousness of God's chosen people
We are justified by standing on the redemption of Christ and by receiving Christ as God to be our righteousness
With Him we have the life-giving Spirit and the riches of life, including the element of life, the law of life, and the sense of life
The life we have in Christ as the Shoot of David and as Jehovah our righteousness is the processed and consummated Triune God
Verse 24 says, 'Judah and all its cities will dwell together in it, the farmers and they who wander with the flocks'
Jehovah will multiply Israel so that they will not be few, and He will cause them to be honored so that they will not be small
If this order departs / From before Me, declares Jehovah, / Then the seed of Israel will also cease / From being a nation before Me forever'
Just as the heavens cannot be measured and the foundations of the earth cannot be examined, the descendants of Israel will never be cut off
According to the Bible, the new covenant is first for the Jews, the people of Israel; it is not first for the Gentiles
God has put us in His new covenant today and has given us the blessings of the new covenant because we have believed into the Lord Jesus
The first blessing of the new covenant is that God will put Himself into His chosen people as their life, and this life is a law
The second blessing of the new covenant is also in verse 33: 'I will be their God, and they will be My people'
Eventually, there will be no need for outward teachings, for Israel will know God by the function of the divine life
He has solved the problem of sin, and now in Him we have been justified by God, and God has forgiven our iniquity and our sin
When Jehovah makes the new covenant with Israel, there will be communication, fellowship, between Israel and God
Jehovah will establish the good word which He has spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah
He will cause to shoot forth a Shoot of righteousness unto David, who will execute justice and righteousness in the land
Concerning the restoration of Israel, Ezekiel prophesied that Jehovah will set up a shepherd to take care of them and to shepherd them
Christ, the real David, will take care of and shepherd Israel at the time of the restoration so that they are filled and satisfied
They will no longer be prey to the nations; rather, they will dwell securely, and no one will make them afraid
The restored people of Israel in the kingdom age will be able to walk in God's statutes and keep His ordinances
In Ezekiels vision recorded in chapters 40 through 48 the recovery of Israel will include the holy temple the Holy Land and the holy city
According to Ezekiel 40 through 48, God will gain the holy temple, the Holy Land, and the holy city among the restored Israelites
At the same time, the Holy Land provides a place for those who serve in the holy temple to live, dwell, and enjoy
The holy city is for government and administration so that God can have a center of administration among His people
The conclusion of the book of Ezekiel is that God will eventually gain a holy temple and a holy city in the Holy Land
Whether it is the temple or the city, it is where God is, it is His dwelling place, and it is His resting place
Jehovah will multiply the Israelites so that they will not be few, and He will cause them to be honored so that they will not be small
Their children will be as they were of old, and their seed will not cease from being a nation before Jehovah forever
He will make a new covenant with the house of Israel so that His law is put within them and written upon their hearts
The good word which was spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah will be established
God will set up David as a shepherd to care for them, make a covenant of peace with them, and make them a blessing
Verse 2 says, 'He will enliven us after two days; / On the third day He will raise us up, / And we will live in His presence'
70 when the Roman prince Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the temple cruelly killed thousands of Jews and scattered the Jews among the nations
Jehovah promised that there will be a harvest appointed for Judah, when He will turn the captivity of His people
In the restoration the earth will be restored to its original condition and will be rich, fertile, and productive
Those who sit under his shade, signifying being overshadowed by the sufficient grace that they enjoy , will return
At the beginning of Hosea, Israel is a harlot; however, at the end of this book, Israel has become a son of God
The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the Spirit of God compounded with Christ's humanity, death, resurrection, and ascension
In that day the kingdom of David and the family of David will be restored, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah
They will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them, and they will make gardens and eat the fruit from them
The Maccabees took Mount Zion as their ground to judge Edom and gained a victory over Antiochus Epiphanes in about 165 B
The victory of the Maccabees is a type of the victory that Israel will gain immediately before the age of restoration
Rather enjoying life without disturbance they will each sit underneath his vine And underneath his fig tree And no one will disturb them
After Christ deals with all the enemies, the remnant of Jacob will be blessed by Jehovah, and they also will be victorious among the nations
The vine will give forth its fruit, the land will give forth its produce, and the heavens will give their dew, that is, their rain
Because of these blessings, the entire country will be fruitful and productive for the enjoyment of the people
At that time, not just one country but peoples, even the inhabitants of many cities from different countries, will come to Israel
indeed, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of Jehovah'
In the millennial kingdom, after the Lord's return and the salvation of the Jews, the entire nation of Israel will be a priesthood
They will teach the Gentiles, the nations, to know God's way and God's person, and they will teach them to worship and serve God
According to Exodus 19:6, God's intention was to have Israel as a nation of priests, and He has never forgotten this
The nations were formerly idol worshippers or atheists, but they will turn to God, and God will turn to them to be their God
The Spirit of power is for strengthening, but the Spirit of grace is for bringing people into the enjoyment of the Triune God
At the time of the restoration, the Israelites will obtain the divine provision of a Redeemer with His redemption
God will provide the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with an opened fountain Christs pierced side for sin and for impurity
In that day there will be an opened fountain for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity'
In the millennium Jehovah as Christ will be King over all the earth; He will be the one God and His name, the one name
Those who do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles will not receive rain
Although the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant nearly two thousand years ago, most Israelites have not benefited from it
When Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews
In the millennium the repentant Jews who are regenerated through the new covenant will be the priests to care for all the nations
In verse 19 of chapter 21, during His last visit to Jerusalem, the Lord Jesus cursed a fig tree because He could not find any fruit on it
To become tender signifies that life has come back; to put forth leaves signifies engaging in outward activities
Although Israel has been restored according to the prophecy of the Lord, the restoration of Israel is not yet in fullness
Amos prophesied that Jehovah will rebuild the fallen tabernacle of David, and all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah
Jehovah God will also pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of supplications
He will provide the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem with an open fountain for sin and for impurity
Malachi prophesied that Christ, the Angel of the covenant, will execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death
With the opening of these seals there are four horses with their riders, signifying the gospel, war, famine, and death respectively
As a result of the judgments in the first four trumpets, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for people to live
The fifth trumpet, which is the first woe as a judgment on men, will be the beginning of the serious woes of the great tribulation
The sixth trumpet, which is the second woe and a further judgment on men, is also a part of the great tribulation
The seventh trumpet also contains the judgment of the dead and the destruction of Satan Antichrist the false prophet and all their followers
John 'saw on the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed up with seven seals'
John also saw that no one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it; hence, he wept much
The white horse is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel, which is clean, pure, just, and approvable both by men and by God
John saw 'a white horse, and he who sits on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer'
Throughout all the centuries, wherever the gospel is proclaimed, it has conquered and has overcome all kinds of opposition and attack
To take peace from the earth, that men should slay one another, and to him a great sword was given clearly indicate war
The history of the past two thousand years has been nothing except the preaching of the gospel, war, famine, and death
They cried with a loud voice saying How long O Master holy and true will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth
Those 'who were about to be killed, even as they were' is a prophecy that refers to those who will be martyred during the great tribulation
The sixth seal is the beginning of supernatural calamities and is God's answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal
According to the prophecy in Joel 23031 there will not be much time between the sixth seal and the first five trumpets in Revelation 86911
What is covered in the sixth seal is the first supernatural calamity, which is close to the beginning of the coming great tribulation
In order to preserve the faithful ones among His earthly people, God will seal them but still keep them on the earth
These saints will pass through the great tribulation and will not be raptured until before the end of the great tribulation
The seventh trumpet will close this age and usher in the kingdom, the new heaven, the new earth, and the New Jerusalem
With the opening of the seventh seal, the age of toleration will be terminated, and another age will be initiated-the age of God's wrath
When the seventh seal is opened, God will come in to intervene in the rebellious and sinful situation on earth
When He offers the prayers of His saints to God, He adds His incense to the prayers for them to be acceptable to God
In the same principle as the judgment upon the earth in the first trumpet, God will judge the third part of the sea
These locusts must be demon-possessed, because they come out of the smoke which issues from the dwelling place of the demons
At that time, only those Israelites who have the seal of God on their foreheads will not be injured by the demon-possessed locusts
Surely the shaking of the earth and the blackening of the sun are nothing compared to the severity of this woe
The angel of the abyss is the beast, Antichrist, who will also come out of the pit of the abyss to lord it over the locusts
It is also in the same three and a half years fortytwo months that the holy city of Jerusalem will be given to the Gentiles for destruction
The four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates are four evil, fallen, and rebellious angels who followed Satan
The four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year that they might kill the third part of men'
The power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents and have heads, and with them they harm men'
The seventh trumpet will sound for a period of time, and it will last for eternity, announcing and proclaiming God's eternal plan
One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the fury of God, who lives forever and ever'
For the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, God still exercises limitations in His ultimate fury in judgment upon the earth
John heard 'a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of God into the earth
In His last fury, God will mark the rebellious ones with a sore on their skin because they bear the mark of the beast
The second poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man; and every living soul that was in the sea died'
There will also be praise from the altar concerning God's judgments being true in nature and righteous in principle
According to verses 14 and 15, when the sixth angel sounds the trumpet, the four angels bound at the great river Euphrates will be released
At the outpouring of the sixth bowl, the water of the Euphrates will be dried up so that these kings and their armies may pass over it
When the seventh bowl is poured out upon the air, a loud voice will come 'out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done'
Immediately after this word is spoken, there will be lightnings, voices, thunders, and the greatest earthquake that the world has ever seen
In verse 8 of chapter 14 the religious, mysterious Babylon is destroyed at the beginning of the great tribulation
In the midst of the downpour of this great hail, those in the empire of Antichrist will continue to blaspheme God
The Lord will reign in the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem for eternity
In the visions of the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls, there are many important prophecies
The first four of the seven seals cover the history of the world from the ascension of Christ to the end of this age
As a result of the judgments in the first four trumpets, the earth will no longer be a suitable place for people to live
The seventh trumpet also comprises the judgment of the dead the destruction of Satan Antichrist the false prophet and all their followers
The mystery of God will be completed, and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ
The Lord will reign in the millennial kingdom and in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem for eternity
After this, there is a period of grace, the age of the church, that separates the sixty-nine weeks and the last week
After the destruction of the city and the sanctuary, the children of Israel had no way to offer sacrifices and oblations in the temple
He will be the totality of all the evil powers in human history and the ultimate issue of all the worldly powers
According to biblical figure, the land signifies the nation of Israel, and the sea signifies the Gentile nations
The seven heads of the beast are seven Caesars of the Roman Empire , signified by the seven diadems on the seven heads
The seventh Caesar, who will eventually suffer a death blow and be resuscitated by the spirit of the fifth Caesar, Nero, will be Antichrist
Since that day Satan has been looking for someone to whom he could give all his power, his authority, and the glory of his kingdom
According to chapter 9, the angel of the abyss emerged shortly after Satan, as the star, fell from heaven to earth
After he is slain and resuscitated, which will take place near the middle of the seven years, he will become the eighth Caesar
No one will be able to buy or sell anything unless he has 'the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name'
The unbelievers will bear the name of Nero on their forehead or on their hand, testifying that they belong to Nero
Both in Daniel and Revelation the beast out of the sea refers not only to the Roman Empire but particularly to Antichrist
Just as the Roman Empire did dreadful things, in the future Antichrist will also do dreadful things to damage people
In the eyes of Nebuchadnezzar, that is, in human eyes, the worldly kingdoms seem to be a great and glorious image
Antichrist will be so strong, stout, imposing, and attractive that he will be able to subdue many simply by the power of his presence
That small horn will also wear out the saints of the Most High, and his intention will be to change the times and the law
Antichrist will not only be the fourth beast in Daniel 7 but also the little horn revealed in Daniel 8:8-12 and 21-25
Once he became strong, the great horn was broken, and in its place four conspicuous ones came up toward the four winds of heaven'
Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which grew very great toward the south, toward the east, and toward that which is beautiful'
The little horn will exalt himself against God and take away the daily sacrifice , stopping the worship of God by the Jews
Since Antichrist will be the embodiment of Satan, he will 'destroy in an extraordinary manner' the mighty men and the holy people
He will also destroy cities and even nations in an unprecedented manner, and he will also destroy the people of God
He will 'exalt himself and magnify himself above every god, and against the God of gods he will speak extraordinary things
He will not regard the gods of his fathers or the desire of women, nor will he regard any other god; for he will magnify himself above all'
Antichrist will 'enter the countries and overflow and pass through' ; 'he will also enter the beautiful land' to take over the Jewish nation
The sea in verse 45 is the Mediterranean Sea, and the beautiful holy mountain refers to Zion, which is in Jerusalem
At the sounding of the fifth trumpet, Satan will fall to the earth and will be given the key of the pit of the abyss
All that Antichrist does will become a trial to those who dwell on the earth during the last three and a half years
Geographically, the false prophet will come from underneath the earth, and symbolically, he will come from the nation of Israel
He will employ satanic power to perform great signs and will do the same thing that Elijah did; that is, he will call down fire from heaven
He will also cause the earth and the earth's dwellers to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed
The false prophet will be eloquent and powerful, and his ministry will be to convince people to worship Antichrist
He will deceive those who dwell on the earth and command them 'to make an image to the beast, who had the stroke of the sword and revived'
The false prophet will actually be able to give the breath of life to the idol, enabling it to speak as a living image
Only those whose names have been written in the book of life of the Lamb will not worship Antichrist and his image
After Christ's ascension, Titus, the prince of the Roman Empire, destroyed Jerusalem and the temple of the Jews in A
After three and a half years, he will begin to mistreat the Jews and order the Jews to stop worshipping God and offering sacrifices
Antichrist the beast who comes up out of the sea is like a leopard his feet are like those of a bear and his mouth is like that of a lion
Antichrist is also the angel of the abyss; he will come out of the abyss and will possess the spirit of Caesar Nero
Only those whose names have been written in the book of life of the Lamb will not worship Antichrist and his image
In this lesson we will continue to see the prophecies concerning Israel in the last week of the seventy weeks prophesied in Daniel
After the dragon is cast down from heaven to the earth , he will persecute the woman who brought forth the man-child
The dragon the serpent will cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current
Three unclean spirits like frogs will proceed out of the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet
These unclean spirits will go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty
Satan will not only persecute the woman but will also make war with the rest of her seed, that is, with the weaker part of the woman
To the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place'
On the one hand when Antichrist persecutes the Jews and forces them to discontinue their worship of God he will seize control of Jerusalem
On the other hand, God will give Jerusalem over to him, allowing Antichrist to do whatever he desires to the city of Jerusalem
During the three and a half years, heaven will be preserved because Satan will be cast out of heaven and down to the earth
Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet, a devilish company, will be on earth doing everything possible to corrupt it
These two witnesses are the two olive trees, the two lampstands, and the two sons of oil standing before the Lord of the earth
Revelation 11:4 says, 'These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth'
Revelation 11:3 says, 'I will cause My two witnesses to prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth'
While the two witnesses are strengthening God's people, an angel will fly in mid-heaven, preaching an eternal gospel
Thousand of them will be killed by this earthquake because they took the lead not to believe in the Lord Jesus
The remnant of the besieged Israel will flee into the valley of Jehovah's mountains by the way opened to them by Jehovah
When the dragon sees that he has been cast to the earth, he will persecute the woman who brought forth the man-child
The dragon will cast water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, but the earth will open its mouth and swallow the river
The two witnesses are the two olive trees, the two lampstands, and the two sons of oil standing before the Lord on the earth
Thousand men will be killed in the earthquake, and the rest will become terrified and give glory to the God of heaven
The remnant of the besieged Israel will flee into the valley of Jehovah's mountains by the way opened to them by Jehovah
They will see and look upon Christ whom they pierced; they will repent and mourn; and they will believe and receive Him
Satan, the devil, has sinned continually from ancient times, and he begets sinners so that they might practice sin with him
Christ partook of blood and flesh and, through death, destroyed him who has the might of death, that is, the devil
After the devil the serpent seduced man into the fall God promised that the seed of the woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent
On the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hangs on him , thereby destroying Satan
At the same time, through Christ's crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man's flesh
At the end of this age the judgment of Christ will come upon Antichrist, the false prophet, Satan, and their followers
Antichrist is the man of lawlessness and the little horn ; the false prophet is the one who works with Antichrist
In Revelation 12 John saw 'a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems'
The dragon and his angels will not be able to prevail, and thus, their place will no longer be found in heaven
When Satan is cast to the earth, the kingdom of God will come and so will our full enjoyment of God's salvation
Under the instigation of Antichrist, human beings will even wage war directly against the Lord of lords and the King of kings
The armies that are in heaven will follow Christ the Lamb on white horses; they will be dressed in fine linen, white and clean
The armies that follow them, however, will be 'killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse'
During the millennium, the citizens on the earth will still have the rebellious nature of mankind, which will need to be exposed and purged
After the thousand years, Satan will be released and used by the Lord to test rebellious mankind and to purge out the rebellious nature
The nations will go up 'upon the breadth of the earth' and surround 'the camp of the saints and the beloved city'
According to Ezekiel 38:2, Gog and Magog are of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, which correspond with Russia, Moscow, and Tobolsk
Revelation 20:8 shows that Satan's deceiving of the nations that are in the four corners of the earth is his deceiving of Gog and Magog
The camp of the saints is the lodging of the overcoming believers, who are the heavenly armies , camping on earth
In the millennium the overcoming believers and the remnant of Israel will be God's faithful people on earth, standing with God and for God
The beast and the false prophet as well as the goats in Matthew 253233 and 41 will be cast into it a thousand years earlier than the devil
After the millennium the rebellious nature of mankind will have been thoroughly purged, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire
In Matthew 25:41 the Lord Jesus said, 'Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels'
Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies will be swept into the 'dust pan' and then dumped into the lake of fire
After the judgment at the great white throne, all the dead unbelievers, the demons, death, and Hades will also be cast into the lake of fire
The Lord gave His disciples the authority over all the power of the enemy Satan for them to execute the sentence that God pronounced on him
At the end of this age, the judgment of Christ will come upon Antichrist, the false prophet, Satan, and their followers
After the Lord deals with the believers, the Jews, the nations, and Antichrist with his followers, He will bring in the millennial kingdom
The millennium refers to the time between Christ's second coming as a King to rule the earth and the new heaven and new earth
The restoration will affect not only man but also the entire old creation-heaven, earth, the animals, and even the trees
There are many prophecies in Isaiah, Zechariah, and the Psalms regarding the millennium bringing in restoration
Verse 8 says, 'The nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, / And upon the viper's den / The weaned child will stretch his hand'
According to 35:1-2, 'The wilderness and the desert will be glad; / And the desert will exult and blossom / Like the rose
Following this second period there will be a third periodthe new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalemthat will last for eternity
The second period of the universe is the period of accomplishment, the time during which God accomplishes His eternal purpose
Although the millennium will be wonderful, during that time the old heaven and the old earth will continue to exist
The old heaven and the old earth will be restored during the millennium, but they will not yet be changed from the old to the new
The changing of the old heaven and the old earth into the new heaven and the new earth will require a thousand years
The period of time from the creation of Adam until the second coming of Christ will issue in the restoration of the universe
Luke 19:12 and the first part of verse 15 indicate that the millennial kingdom will be the kingdom received by Christ from God the Father
The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be composed of all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers
As the overcomers participate in the feast of the kingdom of the heavens, they will drink the cup of the new covenant anew with their Lord
All the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers will be gathered together to be the New Jerusalem on a smaller scale in the millennium
The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be a reward to all the Old Testament and New Testament overcomers
Verse 26 says that Moses esteemed 'the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked away to the reward'
The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm in which Christ and the overcomers will reign over the nations
In the millennium the overcomers will be priests to contact God and Christ and co-kings with Christ to reign over the nations
The heavenly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm for the exercise of this priesthood and kingship
The earthly section of the millennial kingdom will be the realm in which the saved Jews are God's priests to teach the nations
During the millennium the Gentiles will be the nations, and the converted Jews will be the priests, teaching the Gentiles to worship God
In Matthew 25:34 the Lord revealed that the restored nations will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world
Around the Jews there will be the preserved, restored, and restituted nations in the earthly section of the millennium
After the Lord deals with the believers, the Jews, the nations, and Antichrist with his followers, He will bring in the millennial kingdom
The overcomers will reign over the nations with Christ and will be priests of God and of Christ for one thousand years
The saved Jews will be God's priests in the millennial kingdom to teach the nations how to worship and serve God
Revelation 21:1 says, 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more'
Peter 3:13 says, 'According to His promise we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells'
Whereas we are renewed by the Lord's life, the old heaven and old earth will be renewed by the Lord's judgment with fire
God's other kind of work related to the new heaven and new earth is His work of restoration in the old creation
God's life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation possesses the divine life and the divine nature
Even though the old creation came into being through the mighty work of God, He does not reside in the old creation
We are a new creation , not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
The remnant of the living ones will be transferred into the new earth and will be the nations, the people of God, around the New Jerusalem
In the new heaven and new earth, God will have both the new creation and the restored part of the old creation
After the coming forth of the new heaven and the new earth, the holy city-New Jerusalem-will descend to the new earth
In the new universe, the new heaven and new earth, God's focus will be on the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center
Righteousness is the main factor based upon which God's governmental judgment is meted out to all creatures in His old creation
Hebrews 1:8, Psalm 145:13, and Daniel 4:3 indicate that the new heaven and the new earth will exist for eternity
The new heaven and the new earth as the new realm for God's eternal administration will exist for eternity, just as God is eternal
The word month in Revelation 222 indicates that in the new heaven and the new earth the moon will still be there to divide the twelve months
In eternity there will not only be the saved ones in the New Jerusalem and the perished ones in the lake of fire
There will also be a third category of people-those who are neither in the New Jerusalem nor in the lake of fire but outside the city
The rest of the nations will be transferred to the new earth as the nations to live around the New Jerusalem and walk by its light
The people therefore will live on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem and enjoy the common blessings in the new heaven and the new earth
At that time there will be several peoples on the earth, and each corporate people will be a nation on the new earth
Not only will death be cast into the lake of fire, but the elements of death-sorrow, crying, and pain-will be abolished
For this reason, the city will have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God will illumine it
The fact that the kings will bring their glory into the New Jerusalem indicates that they will be subordinate to the New Jerusalem
The nations on the new earth will be preserved by the leaves of the tree of life to exist in the created and restored human life forever
It is the issue of God's work of the new creation in the old creation and of God's work of restoration in the old creation
After the coming forth of the new heaven and the new earth, the holy city, New Jerusalem, will descend to the new earth
