	 <h2 class="head2">The Authority of Elders in the Local Churches</h2>
<p>The truth concerning the administration of the church is related primarily to the limitations on the authority of the elders in a local church. This is a great matter. In the administration of a country, it is essential to know how much authority has been given to the president, how much has been given to the legislature, and how much has been given to various government institutions. If each institution does not recognize its limitations, there will be trouble, and the country will suffer. Similarly, we need to know this fundamental point as it relates to the administration of the church, because the Lord is leading us to have a new beginning, and we need to make a thorough effort to advance the testimony of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Such an advance will involve the move of the co-workers as well as the authority of the elders, and unless we are clear concerning the administration of the church, there will be problems.</p>
<p>As members of the household of God, we should know the arrangement of our household administration. Then we will act properly and not overstep our measure. At the same time, those who bear some administrative responsibility have an even greater need to know the limits of their authority so that they do not restrict or hinder others. This is very much related to our service.</p>
<p>For example, the church in Taipei has more than twenty halls and over four hundred small groups. Consequently, we need to know how those who are in these small groups should move in relation to those who bear responsibilities for the practical and even spiritual aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s move, including the elders and deacons and those who function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Furthermore, we need to know how the administration of the elders and the service of the deacons can be coordinated with the development of these gifts. We need to be clear concerning these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCENTRATING TO ENTER INTO THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Although the Bible does not leave us in darkness, the Bible was not written like a manual of guidelines. Every governmental agency relies upon such a manual, but the Bible was written from the perspective of God. When we read it, we can pick up a point here and another point there, but we must put them together in order to see something. I hope that we all would concentrate when we read the outlines that have been prepared. If we have a sober mind when we read them, they will be perfectly clear and easily remembered. The elderly saints should not make an excuse that they are too old to remember these points. No matter how old we are, we still need to exercise our mind. If the elderly saints are attentive, their mind will become more focused, and these points will be easily remembered. Although an elderly person may be slow in understanding, once something enters into his memory, it will not easily be forgotten. We all must concentrate in order to enter into these basic truths</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Placing Some in the Church:<br />
First Apostles, Second Prophets, Third Teachers<br />
and Then Helps and Administrations</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then...helps, administrations.&rdquo; <em>Helps</em> refers to the deacons, and <em>administrations</em> refers to the elders. According to our concept, elders should come before deacons. Paul, however, first mentions helps and then administrations. This verse shows an order to the various gifts. Paul begins, saying, &ldquo;First apostles, second prophets, third teachers...&rdquo; He uses the words <em>first, second,</em> and <em>third</em> in the first half of the verse, but no sequential numbers are used in the second half of the verse, although there is a clear sense of order. We absolutely believe that Paul was inspired by the Holy Spirit to put <em>helps</em> before <em>administrations,</em> knowing that it would be easy for people to highly regard and exalt the elders.</p>
<p>After Paul&rsquo;s departure, a teacher named Ignatius emerged in the second century. He committed a serious error by teaching that overseers are higher than elders. In fact, the words <em>elder</em> and <em>overseer</em> refer to the same person, with <em>elder</em> denoting a person of maturity and <em>overseer</em> denoting the function of an elder. Ignatius&rsquo;s erroneous view influenced the church and produced a hierarchy, a religious system. An overseer became a bishop of a geographic area that contained more than one local church, and thus he &ldquo;oversaw&rdquo; the elders of several local churches. Eventually, elders were promoted to be bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and even popes. Thus, this hierarchy produced a religious system.</p>
<p>I believe that when Paul was writing 1 Corinthians 12, the Holy Spirit was working specifically to invalidate the notion of hierarchy. We should not have a concept of rank. The elders are not higher than the deacons. Just as the eldership is an office, the deaconship is also an office, each having particular responsibilities and functions. The elders take care of administration, and deacons take care of service. They differ only in function. Thus, we should not bring in the concept of position and rank in any form.</p>
