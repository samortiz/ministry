<p>The statutes, or laws, regulations, set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments. Their stress is on man&rsquo;s worship and service to God and on the rituals and regulations related to man&rsquo;s relationship with God. To illustrate, Exodus 20:22-26 sets forth the prohibition against making idols and the regulations regarding the building of an altar for the worship of God; Leviticus 1 through 7 explain in detail the way to present offerings to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Ordinances</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinances&rdquo; literally means &ldquo;verdicts,&rdquo; or &ldquo;judgments.&rdquo; Ordinances are statutes with verdicts, or judgments, and by extension, (judgmental) rules, ordinances (Exo. 21:1). These also set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the ten basic commandments. The emphasis is on the verdicts that concern the relationships between man and others and between man and God, as recorded in Exodus 21:1&mdash;23:19.</p>
<p>Verses 12-14 and 18-32 of chapter twenty-one set forth the sixth commandment, which says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo;; they explain the particular commandment in detail, supplement it, and give the verdict concerning it. Verses 15 and 17 of the same chapter set forth the fifth commandment, which says, &ldquo;Honor thy father and thy mother,&rdquo; and give the verdict concerning it. Verses 1-6 of chapter twenty-two give a detailed explanation and the verdict concerning the eighth commandment on not stealing; verses 7-15, concerning the tenth commandment on not coveting; verses 16-17 and 19, concerning the seventh commandment on not committing adultery; 22:18 and 20 and 23:13, concerning the first and second commandments on not having other gods and not serving the images; and 23:1-3 and 6-8, concerning the ninth commandment on not bearing false witness. Verse 12 of chapter twenty-three sets forth the fourth commandment on keeping the Sabbath and gives the verdict concerning this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE PURPOSE IN MAKING THE COVENANT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Law Causing the Offense to Abound<br />
That Man May Know Sin</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s original intention was to deal with the children of Israel according to grace. However, they did not know themselves and they did not trust in God&rsquo;s grace. Hence, God began to deal with them according to the law, that through the law the offense might abound (Rom. 5:20a), that is, that their offense might be made manifest, so that they might know that they were not able to keep God&rsquo;s commands and thus might know their own corruption, weakness, and inability. Without the law, man does not know what sin is, but when the law is present, man knows not only what sin is but also what sins he has committed (Rom. 7:7), for by law man has the knowledge of sin (Rom. 3:20) and of his own corruption. Thus the law causes every mouth to be stopped that all the world may become subject to the judgment of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Law Guarding and Shutting Up<br />
God&rsquo;s Chosen People</h2>
<p>God made the covenant with the children of Israel for the purpose of guarding and shutting up God&rsquo;s chosen people, as the sheepfold guards the flock (John 10:1). On a ranch, most of the time the sheep remain in the pasture, not in the fold. The fold is merely a temporary place, but the pasture is a permanent place for them to stay. It is only at night or during winter, when the green pasture is not available, that the sheep are guarded and protected in the fold. In the same manner, before Christ came, God&rsquo;s chosen people were temporarily guarded and shut up under the law (Gal. 3:23) that they might be kept until Christ came.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Law Being the Child-conductor<br />
of God&rsquo;s Chosen People unto Christ</h2>
<p>The law also became the child-conductor of the children of Israel unto Christ (Gal. 3:24). In ancient times, a child-conductor was one who cared for a child under age and conducted him to the schoolmaster. In like manner, the law, as a custodian, a guardian, a child-conductor, was to watch over God&rsquo;s chosen people before Christ came, and to escort and conduct them to Christ when He did come, that they might believe into Him and be saved by Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, God gave the law in order to cause the offense of the children of Israel to abound that they might know sin, to guard and shut them up, and to bring them to Christ. To illustrate, suppose an Israelite sinned. According to the law, he must be condemned and even be put to death, since the law exposed his sin and condemned him. However, by offering the trespass offering on the altar through the priests he could be forgiven. This shows that the law first exposes man and then brings man to Christ. When man is exposed and condemned by the law, he knows that he must bring to the altar the offerings, which typify Christ, that his sins may be forgiven. Therefore, the purpose of God in giving man the law is to expose and condemn man that he may be brought to Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 2, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
