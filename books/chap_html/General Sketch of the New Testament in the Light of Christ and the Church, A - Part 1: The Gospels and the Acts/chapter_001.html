<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SEVEN MAIN ITEMS IN THE GOSPELS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Matt. 1:23; 3:2; 15:30-31; John 6:57; 19:34; 20:22; Acts 2:1-4</h1><p>If we look carefully into the New Testament with much spiritual insight, we will realize that the twenty-seven books it contains are divided into three groups. The first part consists of five books including the four Gospels and the Acts, which tell us the history of a universal man. The first four books reveal the Head of this universal man—Christ, while the last book in this group shows us His Body. Altogether, these five books give us a full portrait, a full picture, of a universal man.<p>The second part of the New Testament comprises twenty- one Epistles from Romans through Jude. These twenty-one Epistles are a full description, definition, and explanation of this universal man. The first five books of the New Testament give a portrait, or history, of the universal man but not much definition or explanation. The full definition and explanation of the universal man is found in these twenty-one Epistles.<p>The last section of the New Testament contains one book, Revelation, which reveals the ultimate consummation of this universal man.<p>The entire New Testament deals with this universal man. The first group of five books gives us a history of this man, the second group of twenty-one Epistles gives us a full definition of this man, and the last part of the New Testament gives us the consummation of this man. Therefore, the subject of the New Testament is the universal man with his history, his definition, and his consummation. If we keep these four terms in mind—universal man, history, definition, and consummation—we have the entire New Testament. These four key phrases are a great help in understanding the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>INCARNATION TO MINGLE GOD WITH MAN</h2><p>In the first four books of the New Testament we first see the Head of this universal man. This Head, Christ, is God the Father in the Son by the Spirit mingling Himself with man and becoming man. Therefore, He is a God-man, God mingled with man, a man who is one with God. Such a wonderful One is the Head of this universal man.<p>The first matter mentioned in the first chapter of the New Testament is Jesus Christ, who is called Emmanuel (Matt. 1:1, 23). Emmanuel means “God with us.” This is God with us not only in an objective way but in a very subjective way, not only outside of man but within man. The name Emmanuel was first prophesied by Isaiah (Isa. 7:14). Emmanuel is the name of the child born of a human virgin. This child is called the Mighty God, and although this child is a son, His name is called the Eternal Father (9:6).<p>By means of chapter one of Matthew, we can see that the significance and importance of Isaiah 7 and 9 are that God Himself came into man to be a little child. The Almighty God came into man to be born of a human virgin (Matt. 1:20, 23) as a little child called Emmanuel, who is God with man and God mingled with man as one. This is the first item mentioned in the New Testament and the first thought in it. In order to understand the New Testament, we must first be impressed with this thought. If we do not have this understanding, we can never get into the real meaning of the New Testament. The beginning of the real meaning of the New Testament is that the Almighty God came into a small man to mingle Himself with man and become a man.<p>On the first page of the New Testament there is the genealogy of Christ. This genealogy is a very brief sketch of the entire Old Testament. To understand the genealogy in the first chapter of Matthew requires an understanding of the entire Old Testament. All of the names found in this genealogy serve to remind us of the histories and stories of the Old Testament. A new, unlearned believer who reads in Matthew 1:1 that Jesus Christ is the son of Abraham must refer to the first book of the Old Testament in order to find out who Abraham is. In addition, the end of this genealogy also brings us to the end of the Old Testament. In this way, the introduction to the New Testament provides a brief sketch, or review, of the Old Testament. In order to understand the New Testament, we must study the Old Testament and remember the stories in it. It is from this point of view that we can understand the New Testament. No human mind or hand could have written such a record. Only the almighty, wise God could have done this.<p>The Old Testament types and prophecies point to Christ and the church. In the types and prophecies concerning Christ there are two elements: God and man. The thought of God mingling with man is in the tabernacle, for example. The ark and the boards of the tabernacle were all made of wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 25:10-11; 26:15, 29). Gold typifies God’s divine nature, and wood typifies the human nature. This is a picture of Christ, the Head of the universal man.<p>In the Old Testament types and prophecies we can also see the church as something issuing out of Christ as the wonderful Head, being the same as He is. Because the church is out from Him, it can match Him and be one with Him. Eve as the wife of Adam typifies the church as the wife of Christ, who comes out of Him (Gen. 2:22-23). In the Bible children also typify that the church is exactly the same as Christ in life, nature, and element, because the church is born of God and is out of Him (Isa. 8:18a).<p>As we have indicated, the first crucial point mentioned in the New Testament is that God Himself came to mingle Himself with man to be a man. This thought is in Matthew 1:18, 20, 23 and Luke 1:35, which speak of Mary conceiving a child by the Holy Spirit, and it is also in John 1, which tells us that the Word, who is God, was incarnated to become a man (vv. 1, 14).
