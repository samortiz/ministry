         <h2 class="head2">The Results of Man&rsquo;s Spirit Being Damaged</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Man Being Alienated from God</h2>
<p>After man&rsquo;s spirit was damaged, it lost its function; as a result, man became alienated from God. Ephesians 4:18 says, &ldquo;Being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart.&rdquo; The Gentiles, being fallen, are darkened in their understanding and ignorant within; consequently, they are alienated from the life of God. Man is alienated from God and unable to receive God as life because he is darkened within and deadened in his spirit. Man&rsquo;s alienation from God is mainly related to his inability to receive God&rsquo;s life. God wants man to receive Him as life in order to contact and enjoy Him, but Satan damaged man&rsquo;s spirit, making it impossible for man to receive God as life. As a result, man is alienated from God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man Losing All Feeling</h2>
<p>A further result of man&rsquo;s fall is that man lost his inner feeling; that is, he lost the consciousness of his conscience. Ephesians 4:19 says, &ldquo;Who, being past feeling.&rdquo; <em>Being past feeling,</em> in the original Greek language, means to discard all feeling, indicating that a person has lost feeling in his conscience. With a deadened spirit and with his alienation from God, man lost all feeling related to his inner sense of God. We must tell the young people, seriously and emphatically, that people are corrupt because their deadened spirit and their alienation from God have caused them to lose all feeling within them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Giving Themselves Over to Lasciviousness<br />
to Work All Uncleanness in Greediness</h2>
<p>The third step of man&rsquo;s fall is that people &ldquo;have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness&rdquo; (v. 19). To give oneself over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness means to do all kinds of immoral things and to live one&rsquo;s life in lasciviousness and uncleanness. This is a matter related to life and to our living. Because of the fall, a person&rsquo;s spirit is deadened. This deadness issues in three things: alienation from the life of God, losing all feeling in his conscience, and a lascivious living that is full of immorality and uncleanness in greed. This is man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S REGENERATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Regeneration</h2>
<p>Now we will cover the matter of man&rsquo;s regeneration, which is related to our salvation. Even though man fell, he can be saved. Man&rsquo;s salvation is related to regeneration. The central meaning of salvation is regeneration. If a person is not regenerated, he has not been saved. A saved person has been regenerated. According to John 1:13, which says, &ldquo;Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God,&rdquo; regeneration means that man is born of God, that God enters into man to be his life. When God enters into man to be his life, He causes man to be born again. Every saved person has two births. His first birth is of his parents, whereas his second birth is of God. A saved person is born again of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man Being Regenerated in His Spirit</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, man is regenerated in a specific part of his being. In John 3:3 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Man needs to be born again in order to enter into God&rsquo;s kingdom. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; This indicates that man must be born of water and the Spirit in order to be born again. Hence, to be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit. God is Spirit (4:24). When God as the Spirit enters into man, man receives God as life and is born again. Then John 3:6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; This verse clearly shows that when the Holy Spirit enters into us, He enters into our spirit and causes our spirit to be born again, because &ldquo;that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; The first reference to <em>Spirit</em> in this verse is to the Holy Spirit, and the second reference to <em>spirit</em> is to our human spirit. Regeneration does not produce a person of flesh and blood but a person with an enlivened spirit. This verse also proves that God regenerates us in our spirit. God is Spirit, and He enters into our spirit to regenerate us.</p>
<p>According to Ezekiel 36:26, God said, &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you.&rdquo; God said that He would give us a new heart and put a new spirit within us. Without a doubt this refers to God&rsquo;s regeneration of our deadened spirit, which makes our spirit new. <em>New spirit</em> does not mean that God creates another spirit for us; rather, He renews our old spirit. God renews our old spirit by coming into our spirit as the Spirit of God thereby enlivening it. Once our spirit is enlivened, it becomes new; that is, our old spirit becomes a new spirit by being enlivened by the Spirit. In verse 26 God said, &ldquo;A new spirit I will put within you,&rdquo; and in verse 27 He said, &ldquo;I will put My Spirit within you.&rdquo; When we are regenerated, God&rsquo;s Spirit comes into us to renew our old spirit, making it new, and to enliven it, making it alive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man&rsquo;s Spirit and God&rsquo;s Spirit<br />
Becoming One Spirit</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s Spirit indwells our spirit and mingles with our spirit to become one spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo; The witnessing of the Spirit with our spirit proves that the Holy Spirit is in our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; The Lord is the Spirit, and when the Lord enters into our spirit and is joined with our spirit, the two spirits become one. These verses show that when God enters into us for our regeneration, the Spirit of God enters into our spirit. Through regeneration, our deadened spirit is made alive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Function of Man&rsquo;s Spirit Being Recovered</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:5 says, &ldquo;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ.&rdquo; Being made alive refers to being regenerated in our spirit. Colossians 2:13 says, &ldquo;You, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses.&rdquo; Here, <em>being made alive</em> also refers to being regenerated in spirit. When we are regenerated, our human spirit is restored to its function. A spirit with a restored function is a spirit that has been made alive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man Being Able to Fellowship with God</h2>
<p>Our spirit being made alive results in three things. First, we are able to fellowship with God. This is in contrast to being alienated from God. A regenerated person is able to fellowship with God. First John 1:1-3 speaks of the fellowship of life. A person who has the life of God can fellowship with God. God&rsquo;s life enables man to fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man Being Full of Feeling Inwardly</h2>
<p>Second, a person who has the life of God is full of inward feeling. This is in contrast to being past feeling as spoken of in Ephesians 4:19. First John 3:19-21 says, &ldquo;In this we will know that we are of the truth, and we will persuade our heart before Him...If our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.&rdquo; The ability of our heart to be persuaded and to not blame us and the boldness that we have toward God are indications of the presence of feelings. Romans 8:6 also says, &ldquo;The mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; This verse speaks of having inner feeling. When our mind is set on the spirit, we have an inward sense of life and peace.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Man Being Able to Live Out<br />
All the Virtues of God</h2>
<p>Third, a person with an enlivened spirit is able to live out the virtues of God. This is in contrast to a lascivious living that is according to all uncleanness in greediness. First John 3:14 says, &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death.&rdquo; Those who love the brothers have passed out of death into life, and those who do not love abide in death. The ability to love the brothers is proof that we have been enlivened inwardly. Romans 13:8 says, &ldquo;He who loves the other has fulfilled the law.&rdquo; Love is the underlying principle of all good deeds; love produces good deeds. The ability to live out love speaks of the ability to live out the virtues of God. Our ability to live out love proves that we have been enlivened in our spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
