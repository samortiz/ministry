   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OLD SEVENTY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A few years ago, an Italian warship was anchored off Gibraltar.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the evening all the sailors went on shore to gamble, drink, and cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among them was one called Old Seventy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was always the head of the band.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That night while he was roaming around the pier, he saw a house, inside which were a few ladies playing the piano, singing hymns, and preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He had never been to a place like this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Out of curiosity, he went in. A woman preacher came up and began to preach to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She did not care whether he was drunk or not, but started to tell him about Christ's death for sinners, His forgiveness of sins, and His bestowing of a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the end she told him that all he needed to do to be saved was believe.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Old Seventy was very touched.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He prayed to the Lord Jesus, believed in Him, and accepted Him as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Afterwards, he went back to the ship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was about to go to bed but felt that he should pray again, so he knelt down before his bunk.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There were more than twenty other sailors in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When they saw what he did, they started to shout, "Hurrah, something new!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Old Seventy has a new trick!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He really acts like he's praying.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That's great.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You can sit up now."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Old Seventy was still praying.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The crowd began to throw boots at him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But he paid no attention to the boots.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After his prayer, he stood up and solemnly declared to everyone that he had believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that word everyone roared and applauded for his excellent show.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>NOT THE SAME</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The next morning, while he was scrubbing the deck, an older sailor came to him and told him that he also was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He asked Old Seventy whether he felt a distinctive joy and peace within him or not.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there was not, he was afraid that it was not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Old Seventy replied, "The Americans only told me that when I believe in Christ, my sins will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They did not tell me anything about peace and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have to find this out from them."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He took leave and went on shore to ask the ladies why it was that he did not have peace and joy after conversion, and whether his faith was a hoax.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An elderly lady sat him down and said, "Don't worry about how you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let me just ask you one question.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Are you different from how you were before?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Old Seventy replied, "I am altogether not the same as before."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After a pause, he repeated loudly, "No, I am not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I was the most rowdy and mischievous among my company.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When it came to wickedness, I was always the first.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After last night, I cannot utter filthy words anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I heard the others using foul language, not only was I unable to join them, I was even ashamed of them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Last night they threw boots at me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Formerly, I would have risen up and given each one of them a good beating.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I felt as if nothing had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I didn't even want to beat them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am definitely not the same as before!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No, I can't be!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At this word, he turned around and ran back to the ship.</S>
