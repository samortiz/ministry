   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY, THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last section of Romans, chapters twelve through sixteen, covers the Body, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The many brothers in chapter eight become the members of the Body in chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not a matter of life life is fully covered in the first section but a matter of function.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being a son is a matter of life, but being a member of the Body is a matter of function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all must function together as the Body to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This Body must be expressed practically in all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, the local churches are the practical expression of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body of Christ is the expression of Christ, and Christ is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in the Body, and the Body is expressed in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in chapter sixteen, we have the churches: the church at Cenchrea v. 1 ; the church in Rome, which met in the house of Prisca and Aquila vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>3, 5 ; the churches of the nations v. 4 ; and the churches of Christ v. 16 . We are now in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Body is in the churches, Christ is in the Body, and God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we see this, then we see the basic concept of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This matter is worthy of our full attention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first section of Romans covers personal salvation, and the last section covers the Body, which is not a matter of individual salvation, but of corporate function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first section is on individual salvation, and the last section is on corporate function.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This corporate function is the Body, which is expressed in hundreds and even thousands of localities as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason that Paul wrote chapter sixteen in such a wonderful way, not in the way of doctrine, but in the way of practical experience, in the way of greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through his greetings, Paul opened a window through which we may look at the churches of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 16 is a window.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord for this window!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without this chapter, we could never be so clear what was taking place in the churches at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>OUR DEEDS EXPOSED</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let us now consider some of the matters found in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this section, Paul firstly exposed us in our doings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not have the words to express how dirty, evil, dark, and ugly are the things exposed by Paul in the opening chapters of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not the persons that are exposed in these chapters, but their doings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should observe this principle in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not quickly expose what people are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You need to first expose what they do their deeds, behavior, and activities.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For instance, as you preach the gospel, you may ask a person what he was doing last night at ten o clock.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have done this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once, while preaching the gospel in the presence of the Holy Spirit, I pointed to a certain young student and said, Do you know what you did?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You stole chalk from school and brought it home.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I pointed my finger at him and said those words, he said within himself, That doesn t mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Immediately I responded, Are you saying that this doesn t mean anything?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That frightened him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then I said, You brought the chalk home and drew circles on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was exactly what he had done.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the message, he was the first to stand up and accept Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With trembling he said, Brother Lee pointed out exactly what I did.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I stole chalk from school and I brought it home.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When he told me that I was saying that it didn t mean anything, that was just what I was saying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And I did draw the circles, just like he said.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This young man was exposed in his deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you believe that you can stand God s exposing?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God were to expose all we have done in the past, we would not be able to stand it, for what we did was dirty, ugly, evil, and dark.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>CONSTITUTED SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Beginning in 5:12, Paul exposes not what we have done, but what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are constituted sinners 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before we ever sinned, we had already been constituted as sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Take an apple tree as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before it bears apples, it is an apple tree already.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It bears apples because it is an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If it were not an apple tree, it would not be able to bear apples.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Likewise, we commit sins because we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not think that we became sinners by committing sins.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No, we commit sins because we are sinners, just as the apple tree bears apples because it is an apple tree.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not say, I am not a sinner, for I don t do evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am always very good.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although you may be good, you are still a sinner, for you were born a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You were constituted a sinner before you were even born.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we came into the world, we came as sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not think that you became a sinner after you were born.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No, you were constituted a sinner in Adam long before you were born.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is Paul s concept.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus, in our behavior we are sinful, and in our being we are constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Furthermore, we also are short of God s glory 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The thought of coming short of God s glory may sound strange to many.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>No human concept takes account of this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>People can understand us when we tell them that their deeds are sinful, and they can be convinced that they have been constituted sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if we tell them that, as constituted sinners who do evil things, they are short of God s glory, they will say, What do you mean?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What is God s glory?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God s glory is God Himself expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whenever God is expressed, glory is seen.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We were made by God in His image that we might express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now instead of expressing God, we express sin and our sinful self.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Hence, we are short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We are sinful in what we do, we are constituted sinners in what we are, and we are short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is our situation, our condition.</S>
