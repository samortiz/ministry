   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECOVERY THROUGH PROPHESYING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Praise the Lord that He did not leave us in our situation but came in to rescue us!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the Lord did not come in directly to be our Shepherd, but, in keeping with Ezekiel 37, He came in through the prophesying of His word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many Christians have a mistaken understanding of prophesying, thinking that to prophesy is only to predict.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But there is hardly any prediction in Ezekiel 37.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead, the prophesying here is a matter of declaring something or speaking something forth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that prophesying in this chapter does not mainly mean to predict but to tell forth, to make some kind of declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord told Ezekiel to prophesy, He meant that Ezekiel should speak forth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord told Ezekiel that when he prophesied, He would send the breath and the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Ezekiel spoke forth, God gave people the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From this we can see clearly that the main meaning of prophesying is not to predict but to speak forth something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Other Christians think that to prophesy is to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But no matter how much one may teach dry bones, they remain dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One may teach dry bones about the need for wind, breath, and the Spirit, but nothing happens to these bones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this chapter Ezekiel neither predicted something to the dry bones nor taught them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, when Ezekiel prophesied, he spoke something for God, and God followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As Ezekiel was prophesying, God was blowing upon the dry bones, sending the wind, the breath, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE WIND, THE BREATH, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Ezekiel 37 three things are related to the prophesying: the wind, breath, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In English these are three different words, but in Hebrew they are only one word, ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 9 uses the word wind and the word breath, but in the Hebrew text both are the same word, ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 14 there is the Spirit, but this also is a translation of ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is difficult for translators to decide how to translate ruach in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The translation is based both upon the context and upon the understanding of the translator.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we apply this matter to our spiritual experience, we may say that when God blows upon us, that is the wind; when we breathe the wind, it is the breath; and when the breath comes into us, it is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First comes the wind and then the breath and then the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Ezekiel prophesied, God blew the wind, the people received the breath, and the breath became the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A NOISE AND A SHAKING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this chapter Ezekiel prophesied twice, in verse 7 and again in verse 10.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 7 says, So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we see that when Ezekiel prophesied there was a noise and a shaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes others complain that our meetings are too noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My answer is that if all were dry bones, everything would be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There would be neither noise nor voice, only quietness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the bones in the valley in Ezekiel 37 were quiet and motionless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when Ezekiel came and prophesied, there was a noise and a shaking, and all the bones came together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I cannot explain why this happened.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do know, however, that when we come together in the meetings and make a joyful noise Psa 95:1 , we are truly one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose we all came into the meeting and sat quietly for thirty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Soon we would become critical of one another, and eventually we would lose our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when we shout joyfully to the Lord Jesus, praising Him and calling on His name, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It may not sound nice to you, but the more we make noise in this way, the more we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we get out of ourselves by calling on the Lord and praising Him, we will be one.</S>
