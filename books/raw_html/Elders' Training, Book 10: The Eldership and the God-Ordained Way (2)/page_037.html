<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The One Solution Being the Decree<br>for All the Churches</H2><P>The one solution made at Jerusalem for the problem of circumcision became a decree for all the churches, both Jewish and Gentile, to keep (Acts 15:1-31). Hence, in relation to the matter of circumcision, all the churches should be the same. After the issuing of such a decree, it would have been wrong to allow the Jewish churches to keep the practice of circumcision while permitting the Gentile churches not to observe it. We should not forget that in the church, in the new man, there is no difference between the Greeks and the Jews, because in the new man Christ is every member (Col. 3:11). The one solution regarding the problem of circumcision was good for all the churches, making all the churches the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Gentile Churches<br>Imitating the Jewish Churches</H2><P>In 1 Thessalonians 2:14 Paul wrote, "For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus." This indicates that the Gentile churches imitated the Jewish churches. This imitating did not make the Gentile churches Jewish; rather, it made all the churches the same in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Books of the New Testament,<br>as One New Testament, Being Written to<br>All the Saints and All the Churches Universally</H2><P>All the books of the New Testament, as one New Testament, that is, as one book, were written not only to their receivers but also to all the saints and to all the churches universally, that is, through all the centuries (1 Cor. 1:2). All the churches on the whole earth through all the centuries have received the same New Testament. The Lord did not write one New Testament to one church and a different New Testament to another church. In 1 Corinthians 1:2, Paul addressed his epistle "to the church of God which is in Corinth..with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place." The one epistle of 1 Corinthians was written to the saints in Corinth, with all the Lord's callers in every place. Thus, it was written to all the saints and all the churches through all the centuries. This indicates that all the churches on this earth should be the same, because they have all received the same teaching, the same New Testament. How, then, could we promote differences among the churches?</P>
