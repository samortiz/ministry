   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOME EXAMPLES OF ORDINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day a sister told me about a Brethren assembly in Vancouver, British Columbia, that was divided over the matter of using a piano and organ in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One group was in favor of the organ, but not the piano, and the other group favored the piano, but not the organ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result they were divided into two assemblies, the organ assembly and the piano assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This division came from their ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1963 in Los Angeles the leaders of at least three particular groups came together with the desire to practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When this was proposed to me, I said, It is wonderful for us Christians to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, I must remind you that believers have been divided by different teachings, opinions, and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among these groups one had a Brethren background, and another had a charismatic background.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As every Christian knows, these two kinds of groups could never get along together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, at that time they all agreed to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then I said, Both those with the Brethren background and those with the Pentecostal background must drop their opinions, practices, and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If not, you will never be one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those in all the groups agreed to drop their opinions and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, they came together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first meeting was held the first Sunday of March, 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was present in that meeting, and it was rather good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There were no ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The following Sunday I was in New York.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In that meeting the ones with the Pentecostal background began to speak in tongues, and those with the Brethren background attempted to stop them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This resulted in a fight in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The next day I received a phone call telling me to come back to take care of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The brother who called was one from a Brethren background.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said that some sisters had not only spoken in tongues, but even played tambourines.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I asked him what was wrong with the tambourines, and I told him to come together and forget about the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I reminded him that they all had said amen to my word about dropping their ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the brother said that he could not tolerate this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Soon I returned to Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those from the Brethren background told me that they could not tolerate the playing of the tambourine in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I said, Brothers, in the eyes of the Lord, what is the difference between a piano and a tambourine?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they admitted that there was no difference, I said, Since there is no difference in the eyes of the Lord between a piano and a tambourine, why would you accept the playing of the piano, but refuse to tolerate the playing of the tambourine?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They said that they did not like it and that they would not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They would accept a piano, but not a tambourine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said, Brothers, if this is your attitude, then our joint meeting is through.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After this, I spoke with those who practiced speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I said, Brothers, I have learned that last Sunday some of you spoke in tongues and played the tambourine.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I said this, they became very touchy and replied, Brother Lee, those brothers don t know their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we spoke in tongues, they called a hymn to stop us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I replied, Brothers, from the very beginning I told you that in order to have a joint meeting with the leaders from different backgrounds, we all had to drop our practices and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if you insist on speaking in tongues and playing the tambourine, eventually the others will stop coming to the meetings, and you will be the only ones left.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What then would be the use for us to come together?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then they said, Brother Lee, do you like the playing of tambourines and speaking in tongues?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I said, It is not a matter of what I like or don t like.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a matter of having the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If I had the church life according to my preference, that would not be the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, it will be something according to my choice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, those on both sides took my word and agreed to come together again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, when we came together, those from the Pentecostal background still cared only for speaking in tongues and playing the tambourines.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They had forgotten what I had said to them and their agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those from the Brethren background looked down upon those who spoke in tongues and did everything possible to control the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As time went by, the tongue-speakers gradually departed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What remained was a group of people talking about the Bible in the way of dead knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They killed everything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problem today is that every group of Christians has its own ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some, turning the question to me, have asked, Don t you have pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I said, Yes, we do, but these are not our ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sometimes we practice pray-reading in the meetings and sometimes we don t.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But some began to oppose the matter of pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord, saying it was the release of the soul, not the release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I heard that a particular brother had opposed pray-reading and calling on the Lord, I said to the brother who had informed me of this, Please ask him this question: While you are condemning pray-reading and calling on the name of the Lord, are you speaking from your spirit or from your soul?</S>
