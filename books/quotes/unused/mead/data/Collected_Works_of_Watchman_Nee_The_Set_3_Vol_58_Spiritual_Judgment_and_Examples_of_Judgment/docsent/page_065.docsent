   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 45 Date:August 25, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER G. G.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a poor family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1927 I accepted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Soon after, I began to confess my sins to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I also began preaching the gospel to children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was married at the age of eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My husband was an unbelieving doctor who was involved with all kinds of evils.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He loved his sins, but I loved my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I began to suffer as soon as I married into his household.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have one girl and one boy, who died at the age of one month.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he died his finger was pointing toward heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although my son died, I dared not look sorrowful, for fear of being criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was still full of joy in my heart and was still able to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Others thought that I was out of my mind, but they did not know me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I knew that I was the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once Brother Witness Lee came to our hometown to conduct conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I became clear about the ground of the church and left my denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone in my family opposed me and even beat me up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later my mother had a stroke and was sick for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I took care of her all that time and learned some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I prayed for a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord's hand seemed heavy upon me all the time, and I was kept in lowly works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been meeting with the brothers and sisters in the church and have received the life supply from them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gradually, I led my family to serve the Lord together in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank the Lord that my house has become a center of hospitality for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once, I seemed to hear a voice which said, "You should be separated unto Me completely."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I answered readily and said, "Lord, this is what I should do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I belong to You."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am willing to put myself in the hand of the Lord and the church and to serve the Lord together with all the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sister, you have to realize that it is not good for a person to be entirely ignorant of God's dealings, but neither is it good for him to be entirely clear about these dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is wrong for a man to be completely ignorant or completely clear about God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as it is not good for a man to be entirely ignorant of his breathing, neither is it good for a man to be completely conscious and aware of his breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the spiritual pathway, it is a wonderful thing for a man to always be in God's light and in ignorance at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, he should know everything that the Lord is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the other hand, he should know nothing that the Lord is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moses did not know anything about the shining on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you think his face would still have shone if he had looked into a mirror every day?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No, he would have fallen into an unhealthy practice if he had done this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our spiritual pathway, we know on the one hand, and we trust on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to exercise faith for at least half of the things we do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Christian journey, it is not a good sign if a man is totally in darkness and ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, it is equally bad if a man knows everything that God is doing in him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In God's dealings with the believers, we need to know some of His dealings, but we do not need to know others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to learn to know the basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some are completely in darkness regarding the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are ignorant of everything that God is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are totally void of light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Others know everything; they are confident about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Under normal circumstances, a man should be like Paul: "For now we see...obscurely" 1 Cor 13:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Christian life should strike a balance between the two extremes with regards to past knowledge and experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to maintain a blessed ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are times when we have to exercise faith in the midst of ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If our sister wants to advance in spiritual things, she should not insist on knowing anything from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She should believe that the Lord is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If something should be known, let it be known spontaneously; she should not insist on trying to know.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a man becomes too clear of spiritual things, there is the temptation that he will become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Moses' face shone, it was better for him not to know about it; it was better still for him not to look into the mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If he were to look at himself, it would be better for him to look when he was not shining.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is a glory to not know about one's own shining.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As soon as one knows it, there is no more glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The same principle applies to the case of Stephen's shining face.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is blessed ignorance when one does not realize that his own face is like that of an angel's. That is the time when glory shines.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot go to the extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to maintain a proper balance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By not knowing and not seeking to know, we do not lose any blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we know too much and become too clear, it is easy for us to fall into pride, and we lose the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more ignorant we are, the easier it is for us to keep the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we can enumerate all our spiritual experiences and can clearly explain them one by one, they no longer are blessings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such an action will make us proud on the one hand and chase away the blessing on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our sister's pathway has been straight, but she has bothered herself too much with explanations and perhaps knows a little too much.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You have to guard against possible pride.</S>
