AND THE AUTHORITIES IN THE HEAVENLIES<br />
THE MULTIFARIOUS WISDOM OF GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:10 says, &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church.&rdquo; This is the display, the demonstration of God&rsquo;s wisdom to the rulers, the authorities, the forces of darkness, Satan and all his followers. The more life we have, the more built up we will be. Eventually we will be a display. This will be a real challenge to the enemy, a shame to him and a glory to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Such a Display of God&rsquo;s Wisdom<br />
Being Even for the Present Time<br />
on the Earth</h2>
<p>The enemy Satan is subtle. Today he causes many children of God to say, &ldquo;It is impossible to have the church built up on this earth. The built-up church must be something not on this earth but far away, not today but in the future.&rdquo; This thought is the subtlety of the enemy. Ephesians 3:10 is not only for the future. Rather, it includes something even in this present age on this earth. In many places the Lord must work out something that is a challenge to Satan. The Lord wants to say, &ldquo;Satan, look. Even in your territory, in the territory utilized and usurped by you, I am working to build up a vessel, a lampstand to shine Me out and to bring all things into order.&rdquo; The built-up church is a real display, challenge, and shame to Satan and a glory to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Built-Up Church Being the Goal of God<br />
and the Target of the Enemy</h2>
<p>If our eyes are truly opened, we will be ready to pay any price for this. We will tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing at any cost to be for the building up of the church in the place where I am.&rdquo; This is not a small matter; it is something very strategic. I know too well that the enemy is struggling over this strategic point. Satan would allow people even to be saved and to seek spirituality as long as they would not be built up. According to the sixty-six books of the Bible, the ultimate conclusion and goal of God&rsquo;s intention is a building. Satan knows this, so on the one hand, he strives to build up something of himself, and on the other hand, he does whatever he can to damage the real building of God.</p>
<p>This is why there is a real struggle here today. The brothers in the Far East, even today, have been much opposed and criticized simply because we stand for the church, the building. No one can criticize us for preaching the gospel or teaching the truth wrongly. The only point of criticism is that we stand here for the building up of the church. We have been suffering, and still we are suffering. All the evil reports about us are due only to this one matter. If we would drop the matter of the church and merely preach the gospel and help people to be spiritual, everyone will praise us. They will say, &ldquo;Those people are wonderful and broad-minded!&rdquo; However, once we pick up the matter of the church, right away our reputation is blackened. People find nothing wrong with us except that we care for the church. Because of this, every kind of criticism comes to us. Some say we are sectarian, narrow-minded, and small. Oh, the subtlety of the enemy! However, all these evil reports one day will become a diamond in our crown.</p>
<p>In the subtlety of the enemy, people in certain places have said even worse things to me. I simply answered, &ldquo;I want to stay this way until the end.&rdquo; I stress this matter because we all have to realize what God&rsquo;s goal today is. If we are men after God&rsquo;s heart, as David was, we have to seek His goal. I am not satisfied simply to see persons saved. I am not satisfied only to see the dear saints seeking the Lord and being spiritual. I will not be satisfied until I see a real building up among the saints. This is the goal of God and the target of the enemy. If we are standing for the church, we will become the target. However, regardless of how much we are criticized, if we are faithful to stand with God, we will be a blessing even to those who criticize us. Today they criticize us, but tomorrow they will preach what we preach. They will receive all the teachings and all the blessings that we minister, and they will help others with them. The only thing they will not preach, however, is the church. We have to realize that to care for the church is a blessing, and we have to suffer for others&rsquo; blessing. Our main aim is to have the building, and this building is a real display and challenge to the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEADING UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST<br />
THROUGH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Another aspect of God&rsquo;s purpose concerning the church is seen in Ephesians 1:10: &ldquo;To head up all things in Christ.&rdquo; God created the heavens and the earth as the universe, and within this sphere or realm He created millions of creatures. At the center of His creation God created man as a vessel to contain Him. Before God could come into man, however, Satan, the enemy of God, came in and injected himself into man as the leading part of creation, particularly into man&rsquo;s body, by tempting man to use his body to take the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. When man took the fruit of that tree, the fruit entered into his body. This is why Romans 5 through 8 speak of sin in the members of man&rsquo;s body. The apostle Paul said, &ldquo;Now then it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me&rdquo; (7:17). Sin here is personified; it is something living because it can dwell, have dominion, and reign as a king over us. Moreover, with this sin there is the law of sin (8:2).</p>
<p>Satan injected himself into the human body. This brought in death, death brought in darkness, and confusion followed darkness. Sin, death, darkness, and confusion influenced the whole universe. Man as the head of creation was damaged, and this damage influenced the whole universe. This is why today even the little mosquitoes trouble us. We need pest control only because everything is upside down and confused. This is due to darkness; darkness comes from death, death comes from sin, and sin is the satanic life, Satan himself.</p>
<p>Now God has come in to impart Himself into man, specifically into his human spirit as life. Life is versus sin. When life comes, light follows, so light is versus darkness. &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4). Following light there is order, which is versus confusion. When Christ comes into us as life, we have the light. Light brings in regulation, and under this regulation we have order, which is the building up under the headship of Christ. From the Triune God as life, the light shines, and under this shining light all things are brought into order under the headship of Christ. Eventually all things will be headed up in Christ. God has started this work, and He will now finish it. One day the New Jerusalem will be completed. Within the New Jerusalem will be God as life, filling the whole city, and this life will shine in and through the city upon all the rest of the creation.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:24 tells us that all the nations will walk by the light of the city. Christ is the Lamb to be the lamp in the center of the built-up holy city (v. 23). God is within Him as the light, and God in Christ shines through the transparent city. The city will be crystal clear and transparent. There will be no more clay or anything opaque, because every piece of clay will have been transformed into precious stone. This transformation to make us transparent will be the real salvation of our souls.</p>
<p>Because God shines in Christ through the city, all the nations will walk by the light of the city. This means that the shining light will bring all creation into order under the headship of Christ. By this time Satan will have been cast into the lake of fire. Furthermore, there will be no more sea, signifying that Satan and his evil followers will all be dealt with and will not be found in the new heaven and new earth (21:1). Satan, death, and darkness will all have been done away with. The Triune God will mingle Himself with the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed persons, and God as life will shine in them, through them, and upon all the rest of the creation to bring all creation into order under the headship of Christ.</p>
<p>Thus, Christ as the Head to head up all things in Himself is the ultimate consummation of the sixty-six books of the Bible. However, never forget that His heading up of all things is through the Body and ultimately through the New Jerusalem. This is the fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10. We must have the real experience of the sonship, which is the experience of life, and we must realize the headship of Christ. Then we will be built up, and we will have the proper order in the building.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
