   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A UNIVERSAL LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the young people go to the campuses to preach the gospel, they need not only a proper daily living but also a universal love.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A universal love is a love for everyone except Satan.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Outwardly, they may not agree with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They may even say that our beliefs are a form of superstition, but deep within many of them appreciate our love toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who love the Lord are often held in high regard by others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nothing can uplift our life standard as high as our love toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we love the Lord, the more we will spontaneously be on the highest level of human standards.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, idolatry, which includes the enjoyment and love for sinful things, brings people into fornication and lowers their standard of morality Rev 2:14, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you just love the Lord Jesus a little, your standard will be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just thinking about loving Him will uplift our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The love of God brings in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Joseph was confronted by the evil wife of Potiphar, he said, "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Gen 39:9c .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joseph loved God and God was always with him.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you love God, you are today's Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The love of God is high.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is the main factor in living a higher life on a higher plain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must love the Lord with all our heart, our mind, and our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word strength refers to our physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to love God with our whole being.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus said, "All men shall know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another" John 13:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The love among Christian brothers is a strong testimony to the unbelievers because there is very little real love among human beings in society.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The love in human society is often a deceiving love, but the love among the saints is real, genuine, convincing, and attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, we need to have a divine communal life for the gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A communal life does not mean that we all live together under one roof.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The proper communal life is a life of love toward all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must have such a life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to invite people to our homes to let them see our communal life of love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will convince our relatives and friends, and may convince many of them to turn to the Lord.</S>
