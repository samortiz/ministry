   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO ENTER INTO THE MYSTICAL REALM OF CHRIST'S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to pass through the physical realm of Christ's earthly ministry and enter into something higher the mystical realm of Christ's heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. In the Mystical Realm of His Heavenly Ministry, Christ Being the Christ as the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's being the life-giving Spirit is a most important qualification for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When He was in the flesh, He was not able to enter into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a young Christian I was bothered when I heard that, according to the Bible, Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I wondered how it was possible for Christ to be in me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At that time, I did not realize that, in and through resurrection, the Christ who was in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later I came to see that the New Testament unveils the fact that the One who died on the cross as our Savior was resurrected, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now He is qualified to carry out His heavenly ministry in the mystical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From His Resurrection through Eternity</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Accomplishing God's Organic Salvation Subjectively in Eight Steps</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the life-giving Spirit Rom 8:9-10; 2 Cor 3:17-18 , Christ is carrying out His heavenly ministry by accomplishing God's organic salvation subjectively in eight steps.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here we can see a sharp contrast: earthly versus heavenly, physical versus mystical, judicial versus organic, and objective versus subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All eight aspects of God's organic salvation are subjective. a. Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regeneration is to generate the redeemed believers with the divine life that they may be born of God to be His children of His species John 1:12-13; 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As God's children we are of His kind, His species.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we are gods, having God's life and nature but not His Godhead. b.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Feeding</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Feeding is to feed the newborn babes by regeneration in Christ's shepherding His flock by nourishing and cherishing Eph 5:29 that His sheep may grow in the divine life unto maturity John 10:10-11, 14-16; 21:15-17; Heb 13:20; 1 Pet 5:4; 2:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Feeding surely is organic. c.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Dispositional Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Dispositional sanctification is to sanctify the believers who are growing in the divine life in their disposition with the holy nature of God Rom 15:16; 6:19, 22; 1 Thes 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our natural disposition is crooked, perverted, and distorted, yet it can be sanctified and corrected, not with teaching but with the holy nature of God.</S>
