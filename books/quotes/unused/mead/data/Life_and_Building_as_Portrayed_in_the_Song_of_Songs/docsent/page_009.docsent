   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE LOVING THE LORD FOR HIS PURPOSE Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:2-4, 13-14; 2:3-4, 8-10, 16-17; 3:1-4 RECEIVE AND ENJOY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that to believe in the Lord is to receive Him, and that to love Him is to enjoy what we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So many Christians have believed in the Lord and received the Lord, but not many enjoy the Lord by loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John 14:21 and 23, the Lord says that when we love Him, He will manifest Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a personal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He says that He and His Father will come to us and make Their abode with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This really means a mutual abode.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will be our abode, and we will be His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a mutual abiding involving persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Person comes to make His abode with us; hence, we must take the Lord as a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This abounding grace is not only in faith, but also in love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the Lord, the Lord came to him as a great light and he was smitten to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then Saul called, "O Lord, who are You?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And the Lord answered that He was Jesus, the One whom Saul was persecuting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But just by that calling, "O Lord," Jesus came into His persecutor and turned him into one who loved the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is really grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is grace that causes us not only to believe in Jesus, but also to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, Paul said that the grace of the Lord is abundant in faith and in love 1 Tim 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then Paul says in Galatians 2:20, " who loved me, and gave himself for me."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul is saying that since Christ loved him, he must love Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His love constrained Paul to love Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way Paul took the Lord Jesus as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is much talk today about Christ as life, but not many Christians really know how to enjoy the Lord as life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not a matter of knowing, but a matter of enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yes, Christ is our life, but how can we enjoy Him as our life?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no other way except by loving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life is not a doctrine; this life is a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would enjoy Him as our life, we must take Him as our Person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The One who is our life is a living Person!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we must love this Person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>PERSONALITY PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To love a person is wonderful, but it also causes problems.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have been loving this particular Bible since 1964.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the past eight years, I have never had any problem with it, because it is not a person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no problem to love something which is lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when you love a person, there are always problems.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of us who are husbands do love our wives, yet loving our wives often times causes problems.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And the more we love them, the more problems we have.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Bible has never given me any problem because it has no personality, but the more the wives and husbands love each other, the more trouble they have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Generally speaking, you never hate a person whom you have never loved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Loving a person really involves something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more you love, the more problems you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You will never hate a stranger walking on the street; it is always those with whom you have close contact, such as your roommate or your marriage mate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First we love them, but then our love issues in problems.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have never met a husband who had no problems with his wife, and I have never met a wife who had no problems with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is because they love one another as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we did not have love, there would be no problem; but because the one we love is a person, there are problems.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because I am a person, I cause problems for my wife and for those with whom I am closely associated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While we work together and love one another, we experience some problems.</S>
