   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN A BELIEVER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST Date: November 15, 1935, evening</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Chuenchow GLORIOUS GRACE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Old Testament, Adam was commanded by God to obey His word after he was created.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If Adam had obeyed God, he would have pleased God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the time of Moses, God decreed the law and He intended for the Israelites to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God said that those who kept it would live.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God gave many commandments and laws for man to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament, God gave the commandments and man was to keep the commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God was the One who gave the law, and man was the one who obeyed the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although God still has His commandments for man in the New Testament, they are not to be kept by man but by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Old Testament is a matter of God demanding and man meeting the demands, whereas the New Testament is a matter of God demanding and then meeting the demands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament, man bears no responsibility whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brothers and sisters, do you think that I have made a mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No, this is the glorious grace of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CHRIST ANSWERING GOD'S DEMAND</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some have said that the responsibility placed on man in Matthew 5 is greater than the responsibility placed on man in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Old Testament, "it was said to the ancients, You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment'" v. 21 , but in the New Testament, the Lord said, "Every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment" v. 22 . The Old Testament says, "You shall not commit adultery" v. 27 , but in the New Testament, the Lord said, "Every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart" v. 28 . This means that even a thought in the heart is not allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This may sound like a higher requirement than those in the Old Testament and that our burdens are heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we do not have to bear any responsibility of our own because the Lord Jesus said, "For My yoke is easy and My burden is light" 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that we do not need to bear any responsibility; we can let go and the Lord will bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is fulfilling His requirements through Christ who is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Corinthians 4:7 says, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything of Christ is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His love, purity, patience, meekness, and all of His virtues are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not have anything to do with meekness directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First we have the indwelling Christ, then we have meekness, love, purity, and patience, etc. Our relationship is firstly and directly with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A BELIEVER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible shows five relationships that we have with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first is the relationship between the vine and the branches John 15:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The second is the relationship between the Head and the members 1 Cor 12:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The third is the relationship typified by Christ's flesh becoming our food, that is, as our bread of life John 6:35, 51-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fourth is the relationship between the bride and the Bridegroom John 3:29a; Eph 5:22-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fifth is the relationship between the Father of the orphan and the orphan John 14:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Vine and the Branches</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 15:5 says, "I am the vine; you are the branches."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word "are" in this verse is very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This speaks of a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not have to ask to be a branch; we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We often look at ourselves and find no fruit, and we are hesitant to say that we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, God said, "You are the branches."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If God says that we are the branches, we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During a certain period of his life, Mr. Hudson Taylor experienced constant failure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He experienced weaknesses constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He wrote to his sister that he was experiencing much turmoil in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He felt that he lacked holiness, life, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He thought that everything would be well if he could only continually abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For a few months he prayed, struggled, fasted, made resolutions, read the Word, and spent much time meditating on the Lord, but nothing worked.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He wished to remain in Christ all the time, but it seemed as if he could only do so for a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He felt that he was detached from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He thought that everything would be well as long as he abided in Christ, yet he could not abide in Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In his diary he recorded a story.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day he was praying and considering how he would have the strength to overcome his sins if he could only abide in Christ and receive nourishment and supply from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He prayed repeatedly and went to the Word repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he came to John 15:5, which says, "I am the vine; you are the branches," he suddenly exclaimed, "I must be the greatest fool in the whole world!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have been praying all this time to be a branch, to abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the Lord said, You are a branch already, and you are already in Me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Mr. Taylor testified, saying, "From the day I understood this truth, I became a new Hudson Taylor." From that time forward, he realized that the branches of the vine do not have the responsibility of bearing fruit; it is the vine that bears this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord is the vine as well as the branches, the leaves, the root, the fruit, and even the sunshine and the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is everything to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The husbandman is the Father, and the vine bears fruit through the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no need for us to struggle to be branches, and there is no need to force ourselves to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All that we have to do is to remain in our position as branches.</S>
