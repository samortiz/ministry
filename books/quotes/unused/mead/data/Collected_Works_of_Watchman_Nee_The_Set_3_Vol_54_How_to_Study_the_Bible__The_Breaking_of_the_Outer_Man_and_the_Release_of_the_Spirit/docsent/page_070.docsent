   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR HOW TO KNOW MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is crucial for a worker of the Lord to be able to know men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to know what kind of person he was and what he has now become.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to know what he is saying with his mouth and what he is really saying in his heart, and what is the difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to know what he is trying to hide from us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to know his outstanding characteristics, whether he is stubborn or humble, and whether his humility is real or artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The effectiveness of our work very much depends on our ability to discern the spiritual condition of others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Spirit of God shows our spirit the condition of those who come to us, we will be able to give them a suitable word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever men came to the Lord in the Gospels, He spoke a suitable word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord did not speak to the Samaritan woman about the truth of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither did He speak to Nicodemus about the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word on regeneration was for Nicodemus, and the word on the living water was for the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How fitting!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To those who had never followed Him, He issued a calling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To those who wanted to follow Him, He spoke of bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To those who volunteered, He spoke of counting the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To those who were hesitant to follow, He spoke of letting the dead bury the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has a suitable word for everyone, because He knows everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether a person comes to the Lord with a seeking heart or a prying attitude, our Lord knows him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason His word is forever effective and suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our Lord is far ahead of us in dealing with men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are following Him only from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we are following at a distance, we still have to follow; the direction has to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we may learn to know men as He does.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we place a soul in the hand of a brother who has no discernment of men, he will not know how to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He will only speak according to his subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he has a certain feeling on a certain day, he will speak of this feeling to whomever he meets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he has a favorite subject, he will speak to everyone about that subject.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can such a person do an effective work?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No doctor can prescribe only one kind of medicine to all of his patients.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Unfortunately, some servants of God have only one prescription.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They do not understand others' illnesses, yet they try to heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not know the problem, they do not know the complexity of men, and they have never learned to know the spiritual condition of others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, they act as if they have a ready treatment for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is indeed foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot expect to heal every spiritual sickness with just one spiritual prescription.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is absolutely impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not think that those who are slow in feeling will have a difficult time discerning men, but that those who are sharp in mind will have an easy time discerning men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither slowness in feeling nor sharpness of mind have anything to do with discerning men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot discern men with our mind or our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No matter how sharp our mind is, we cannot bring the hidden things in man to light, nor can we touch the depth of man's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a worker contacts a man, the first and most basic thing for him to do is to learn what this person's real need is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes even the person's own answer is unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When he says that he has a headache, does he really mean that only his head hurts?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Perhaps the headache is merely a symptom; his sickness may not be in the head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Or he may say that he feels feverish, but this does not necessarily mean that he has a temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He can say many things, but the things he says may not be that reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Very few patients really know what is wrong with them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They do not know the kind of sickness they have.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They need us to diagnose them and tell them of their need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we want them to tell us what is wrong with them, they may not be able to tell us the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only those who have studied medicine, that is, those who are trained in discerning spiritual problems, can tell them what they need.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we are making a diagnosis, we must know what we are speaking of.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot impose a diagnosis upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A subjective person will insist that others are sick with what he imagines the illness is; he will impose an illness upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a person is sick or in difficulty, he cannot identify his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have to point it out to him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet we should not insist on our diagnosis in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whether or not we can render help to the brothers and sisters depends on whether we can identify their problems and give them the right prescription.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our diagnosis is correct, we will help them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes we may find out that their problem is beyond our ability, but at least a course of action is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some spiritual conditions are within our ability to help, while others are beyond our ability to help.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not be so foolish as to assume that we can do everything and can help everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Some people are within our ability to help, and we should give our whole being to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some people are beyond our ability to help, and we should tell the Lord: "This is beyond my power.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I cannot deal with this sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have never been trained in this matter, and I cannot deal with this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Lord, be merciful to him!"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Perhaps the specific function of some members of the Body will come to our mind, and we may realize that this is something that that brother or sister can do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We then can refer the matter to him or her.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We know our own limitations, and we know that this is all we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not think that we can take every kind of spiritual work upon ourselves; we cannot monopolize everything.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to see our limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At the same time, we have to know the supply in the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should be able to look to them and say, "This is something beyond my ability.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is your business."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the principle of co-working together, the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can never move independently.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Every worker of the Lord and servant of God has to learn to know men.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Those who do not know others' spiritual conditions are not qualified to work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is unfortunate that the spiritual well-being of many people is ruined in the hands of inexperienced brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>These brothers cannot render others any help.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They can only impose their subjective views on them; they cannot meet the objective needs.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is our most serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Others are not sick in a certain way just because we think that is their sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Whatever their spiritual condition may be, they are what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Our responsibility is to learn their spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are not properly calibrated, we will not be able to render help to other children of God.</S>
