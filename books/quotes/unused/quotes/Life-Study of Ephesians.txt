Ephesians covers seven aspects of the church the first of which is the church as the Body of Christ the fullness of Him who fills all in all
Chapter one mentions the fullness of Him who fills all in all, and chapter four, the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The husky young American men, who assimilate so much of the rich American foodstuffs, are the fullness of America
When we digest and assimilate into our being the riches of Christ, these riches become part of us, and we become the fullness of Christ
The church is not only the Body of Christ having the life of Christ; it is also the new man having Christ as the person
No doubt, this new man is corporate, for 2:15 says that Christ created two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, into one new man
If we see that the church today is not only the Body, but a man with a person, our realization of the church life will be uplifted
At home you do not speak much about rights, for there you have the father's life and the enjoyment of his life
Universally the church is the temple in the Lord, and locally the church is the dwelling place of God in our spirit
The whole armor of God spoken of in chapter six is not for the individual Christian, but for the whole church as the new man
In such a church there is the kingdom of God with rights and responsibilities and the family of God with life and enjoyment
We cannot find the kingdom, the household of God, the dwelling place of God, the bride of Christ, or the warrior of God
Especially those who bear responsibility in the churches need to see the vision of the church presented in Ephesians
In Revelation we see four additional aspects of the church: the church as the lampstand, the man-child, the firstfruit, and the holy city
We shall see the blessings: God's selection, predestination, sonship, holiness, redemption, sealing, pledging, and much more
In chapter three we shall see the revelation of the mystery and the ministry of the stewardship concerning the church
As revealed in the last three chapters we shall know how to walk on earth to bear responsibility and to fight the battle for Gods purpose
Because Ephesians brings us into the heavenlies we should not remain in our condition instead we should be in eternity and in the heavenlies
To understand this book, we need to be delivered from our condition and brought into God's eternal purpose and into the heavenlies
That is the improper emphasis of the so-called inner life people who seek Christ, not for the church, but for their experience
We need the practical experience of Christ so that we shall be able to say that whether in death or in life Christ shall be magnified in us
We should also be able to say that for us to live is Christ and that we count all things but dung on account of the excellency of Christ
Because Paul was not a self-appointed apostle, but an apostle through the will of God, he had the authority that comes through God's will
Paul's being an apostle of Christ refers to his position, and his being an apostle through the will of God refers to his authority
The substance of grace is God Himself, and the condition of peace is that which issues out of our enjoyment of God as grace
As His created ones, regenerated ones, and redeemed ones, we are positioned to receive grace and peace from Him
Used with respect to God, this blessing is a laudation, a genuine praise, even a praise to God on the highest level
The Greek word with the basic meaning of well-speaking is the word used by the Apostle Paul in 1:3 for the praise of God
Many of the young people like to sing the Psalms, especially the Psalm that says, 'His mercy endureth forever'
The first is the mixture created by the Catholic Church, which has blended the New Testament economy with the Old Testament rituals
God is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of Man, and God is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God
Our Lord refers to the lordship of our Savior , Jesus to the man as our Savior , and Christ to God's anointed One
We should speak well of God, not according to our natural concept, but according to His revelation concerning Himself
The praise that speaks well of God's mercy and greatness is elementary, whereas the praise in 1:3 is the praise in graduate school
We have not only creation, indicated by the title 'God,' but also incarnation, indicated by the title 'the God of our Lord Jesus Christ'
The first revelation of God in the Bible is in creation, for the Bible opens with the words, 'In the beginning God created
We today worship not only the God of creation, but also the God of incarnation and the Father of the impartation of life
The highest praise to God says that our God the Creator became a man and that our God is also the life-imparting Father
To praise God that His mercy endures forever does not imply anything of incarnation or the impartation of life
Because Paul's well-speaking in 1:3 is difficult to understand, he prayed elsewhere in Ephesians 1 for a spirit of wisdom and revelation
We need to bless the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praising Him for creation, incarnation, and the impartation of life
The little word 'to' implies a transmission, indicating that whatever Christ has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church
Lord signifies Christs lordship Jesus signifies His humanity to be our Redeemer and Savior and Christ signifies that He is Gods anointed One
In our well-speaking we need to have the thought of incarnation, the impartation of life, and the heavenly, spiritual transmission
If you want to hear God's well-speaking, you need to read the New Testament and say amen to every aspect of it
All these are good things of God's creation, and we are qualified to partake of them because we are God's creatures
As the redeemed ones, we enjoy forgiveness of sins, justification by faith, reconciliation in God's grace, and sanctification
Through the blood of Christ, we enjoy forgiveness of sins, the washing of the blood, justification by faith, and peace with God
The third aspect of well-speaking is that God 'has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ'
They are from the heavens with a heavenly nature, heavenly state, heavenly characteristic, and heavenly atmosphere
The blessings bestowed upon us are of God the Father, in God the Son, through God the Spirit, and in the heavenlies
Hallelujah, we are in Christ, who is the sphere, the channel, the instrument, and the virtue in which we have been blessed!
Following verse 3, verses 4 through 14 present a list of all the spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us
God's choosing is His first blessing bestowed upon us; it is the first item of God's well-speaking concerning the church
The book of Romans begins with fallen men on earth, whereas Ephesians begins with God's chosen ones in the heavenlies
Among millions of people, He foresaw us before we were even born and selected us before the foundation of the world
Holy not only means sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common
For us, God's chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of His divine nature and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself
No matter how high were the spiritual experiences of those in Genesis, there was not on earth the Holy of Holies for man to enter
In Exodus something extraordinary took place: on earth among men there was a place called the Holy of Holies, and God was there
When God came in to charge His people to build the tabernacle with the Holy of Holies, the word 'holy' began to be used
Any place, any thing, any matter, and any person that is related to God is holy, for whatever is both of God and for God is holy
There is no doubt that we all are holy, but it is open to question whether or not we are holier or the holiest
The purpose of this illustration is to point out that when we are in touch with God, we are holy, for then we are under His saturation
Everything related to God's ordination in the Old Testament was holy because it involved the meeting together of God and man
We have pointed out that the term 'Holy Spirit' was used the first time when the Lord Jesus was conceived in the virgin Mary
Only in the New Testament time, when God came into man and became man, do we have something that is of the Holy Spirit
Holiness actually means to be saturated with God, to cause a common person to be fully saturated with the Spirit
We are not like furniture that is for God; we are living people with the Spirit of God in us to make us one with Him
Because the power of the Spirit overshadows us, we cannot use certain words, go to certain places, or do certain things
We have a sanctified position, not only by the blood and by the Spirit, but also in the name of the Lord Jesus
Others may go to sporting events or to the movies, but we would not go because we do not want to shame the Lord's name
Separation is not related to whether or not something is sinful; it is a matter of whether we are common or separated
Before we are justified, we are sanctified by the blood, by the Holy Spirit, and in the name of the Lord Jesus
Many of us who were in Christianity for years can testify that while we were there we did not undergo very much of this saturation
Dispositional sanctification firstly transforms our soul by saturating every part of our inward being with the holy element of God
Through dispositional sanctification, all the saints will consummately be the holy city, permeated with the holy God
Eventually we shall be so holy and so pure that we shall be without blemish, without any foreign particles, having only the divine element
We shall be holy and without blemish, not according to our standard or in our eyes, but according to His standard and in His eyes
We are separated unto God and then we are continually saturated with God until all the mixture in us is swallowed up by the divine nature
When this takes place in full, we shall be wholly sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God's Son, Jesus Christ
Ephesians 1:5 says, 'Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
In the grammatical construction of verses 4 and 5, the subject and the main predicate are not in verse 5, but in verse 4
In eternity past, God predestinated us unto sonship, marking out a destiny for His chosen ones before the foundation of the world
Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose to determine a destiny beforehand
God firstly selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny
In Christianity we see groups of people who are saved, but who are still common and worldly, not having any holiness whatever
The church is not a group of Christians who are zealous, yet who are common and worldly without any separation or saturation
At the time we believed in the Lord Jesus and were regenerated, the Spirit of God came into us as the Spirit of the Son of God
Galatians 4:6 says that the Spirit of the Son cries, 'Abba, Father,' but Romans 8:15 says that it is we who cry out in this way
You know that if we call Abba Father we will not be able to take part in sports because we know that our Father doesnt approve of them
We have been predestinated unto sonship, not only by the Spirit of the Son of God, but also in the life of the Son of God
We have two beings: the first is the natural being that was born of our parents, and the second is the spiritual being that is born of God
If a child takes something bitter into his mouth, he will spontaneously spit it out, even if he does not know the meaning of the word bitter
Because the life within every child rejects bitter things, there is no need to have regulations about bitterness
If we call, 'Abba, Father,' and live according to the life of the Son of God, we shall have joy in the depths of our being
Not only do we have the Spirit of the Son of God and the life of the Son of God, but we are also in the position of the Son of God
Hallelujah, we have the Spirit of the Son of God, the life of the Son of God, and also the position of the Son of God
When the New Jerusalem comes, the universe will know that we are the sons of God in position as well as in life
There is no need for us to tell one another that we are sons of God, for we all recognize one another as God's sons
Although we have the Spirit, the life, and the position to be the sons of God, we are not yet holy as far as our disposition is concerned
In the church life God is constantly mixing us so that we might be sanctified by being mingled with His nature
Because we have these three things, the Father often puts us into the 'blender' so that we may be dispositionally sanctified
Sometimes the Father seems to say, 'My child, you have the Spirit, the life, and the position, but you still need to be blended
If the kitchen were not in such a state during the preparation of the meal, it would not be possible to have a feast
When the New Jerusalem comes, it will be a holy, corporate sonship with the Spirit, the life, and the position
Blessed are you if you have been offended by the brothers, the sisters, and the elders, for you have been 'sonized' a great deal
Of leaving the church life at such a time, we should cherish it all the more and even kiss the offense because it 'sonizes' us
Whenever you want to run away from the church life, the life of the Son of God within you will say, 'Don't run away
Our spirit has been 'sonized,' our soul is in the process of being 'sonized,' and when the Lord comes, our body also will be 'sonized'
In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says that he labored more than the other apostles, yet not he, but the grace of God which was with him
If you get into the spirit of the New Testament concerning grace, you will realize that grace is somewhat personified
Many of today's Christians, however, remain in the elementary grades, even though they may have been Christians for many years
In the same principle, the Son of God came as the effulgence of the glory of God, which means that He is the expression of God
As we receive grace and enjoy God, we have the sense of glory, although we may not have the words to express this sense
When we praise God, we praise Him primarily for what He is or what He does, no matter whether or not we have received any benefits from Him
Not only will the angels praise God for our sonship, but also every positive thing in the universe will praise Him
We, the sons of God, may be surprised by the praises offered to God by the angels, for they will be praising God because of our sonship
Of talking so much about ourselves and thinking about ourselves, we should speak of God's grace and think of how He has graced us
In this sense we should all appreciate ourselves and ever esteem ourselves highly because we are the object of God's delight
When we come to that chapter, we shall see how pitiful our situation was and how much we were in need of God's mercy
Although chapter one is altogether glorious, it nevertheless refers to our need for redemption due to the fall
Ephesians 1:7 says, 'In Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace'
As we saw in the last message, verse 6 reveals that we have become the object of God's favor, for we have been graced in the Beloved
Although it is accurate to say that we are redeemed in Christ, it is not as delightful as saying that we are redeemed in the Beloved
Even these offenses made redemption necessary, and the blood of the beloved Son of God was shed on the cross for our forgiveness
The first blessing is selection to be holy, the second is predestination unto sonship, and the third is redemption in the Son
Although God delights in us and has made us the objects of His grace, we still need redemption because He is the righteous God
Redemption is what Christ has accomplished for our offenses; forgiveness is what Christ accomplished applied to our offenses
Although redemption was accomplished on the cross when Christ shed His blood, it was not applied to us at that time
For the actual accomplishment of redemption, there had to be the blood of a higher life, a blood altogether sinless
By the shedding of His blood once upon the cross, the eternal redemption of God's chosen ones was accomplished once for all
In order for the Lord Jesus to be conceived, there was the need for the Holy Spirit to contact the virgin Mary
He was nailed to the cross and hung there for six hours, from nine o'clock in the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon
Both redemption and forgiveness are according to God's righteousness, but they are accomplished and applied by God's rich grace
In other words, this abounding grace makes us God's inheritance on the one hand and makes God our inheritance on the other hand
We need to see the abounding grace that makes us an inheritance to God and qualifies us to inherit all that God is
Wisdom is what is within God to plan and purpose a will concerning us; prudence is the application of God's wisdom
God firstly planned and purposed in His wisdom, and then He applied what He had planned and purposed for us with prudence
Wisdom was mainly related to God's plan in eternity, and prudence is mainly related to God's execution of His plan in time
Verse 5 says that God has predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will
Beginning at the time of His descension, repentance and forgiveness were brought down to earth and poured out upon God's chosen ones
Through the accomplishment of redemption and the application of forgiveness, we have been regenerated to become sons of God
Even more of God's grace is revealed in verse 8, which says that God has caused His grace to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence
Verse 9 says, 'Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself'
The phrase 'the praise of His glory' is found three times in this portion of the Word, in verses 6, 12, and 14
Some may say that God's will and intention is to have the church and that the church is the desire of His heart
Most Christians today do not see the crucial and vital matter that God in His Son is working Himself into His chosen and redeemed ones
They may know about God's selection and redemption, and they may realize that they are the chosen and redeemed ones
They do not see that the very God who has chosen and redeemed them desires, in the Person of the Son, to work Himself into them
The mystery of the universe is the church, and the church is a group of people into whom God is working Himself
Eventually, the church will be fully saturated with God and will consummately become the holy city, the New Jerusalem
As we have pointed out a number of times, both God on the throne and the New Jerusalem have the appearance of jasper
Many know only about being saved, being regenerated, becoming the children of God, and going to heaven some day
The mystery of God's will is to have a church constituted with those who have been saturated and mingled with God
Because many do not have the adequate vision or revelation, they do not know what is actually taking place in the church life
God's will is God's intention to accomplish what He has purposed in eternity past and what He desires for Himself for eternity future
We, the sons of God, in whom God's grace abounds, are the focal point of His purpose, and everything is working for us
Before the creation of the human race, God made an archangel, who later became Satan, the head of all creatures
All around us, at school, at work, and in the government, we see nothing but a state of collapse; nothing is headed up
Of 'to head up all things in Christ,' the King James Version says, 'He might gather together in one all things in Christ'
Verses 9 and 10 should not be isolated from the preceding verses, for verses 3 through 14 are actually one long sentence
If you read these four verses together, you will see that everything in them is related to the abounding grace
A man may be very wealthy, but if he has no children, he is actually poor and may think of himself as having nothing
In a family, not only are the children the inheritance of the father, but also the father is the inheritance of the children
By the abounding grace certain things are taking place in the universe to bring about the heading up of all things in Christ
They do not cover the crucial point that the abounding grace is working on the church people so that all things might be headed up in Christ
God has graced us and caused grace to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence that He may head up all things in Christ
Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth
Because the church is the Body and because Christ is both the Head and the Body, we may say that, in a sense, we, the Body, are also Christ
We are not only head over insects, cats, and dogs, but also over presidents, kings, generals, and industrial leaders
The church is under nothing but Christ Himself; we are above everything else because we are the Body of the One who is over all things
Do you have the confidence to say that you are above the President of the United States and the Queen of England?
Due to the two rebellions, the angelic rebellion and the human rebellion, the whole universe is in a state of collapse
In the collapse caused by rebellion certain people, such as the President or other heads of government, are above others
God created the universe in an excellent order, but an archangel, the head of the age before Adam, rebelled and became Satan
According to the Bible, God's salvation is not primarily to save us from hell; it is to save us from the heap of collapse
Under the headship of Christ, we are outside of the heap of the universal collapse, and we are over all things
In the church life it is God's chosen ones, not the world leaders, the unbelievers, or the animals, that are being headed up
God will not have a way to accomplish the heading up of all things in Christ if we, the chosen ones, are not willing to be headed up
If we are willing for this, God will say with joy, 'These are the pioneers who are taking the lead to be headed up
The same is true of the human life: nations fight against nations, people against people, and race against race
Today there is a great deal of negotiation about the limitation of weapons, but in the millennium there will be no weapons at all
Isaiah 55:12 says, 'All the trees of the field shall clap their hands,' singing together in harmony in praise to God
Psalm 96:12 and 13 declare, 'Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord'
Not only the universe and human society are in a state of collapse, but even the so-called church is in the same condition
All of human society, including today's Christianity, is nothing but death and darkness and, hence, a heap of collapse
Although today's Christianity is a heap of collapse in death and darkness, we in the church life are in life and under light
In the New Jerusalem there will be no death and no night; instead, everything will be saturated with life and be under light
We shall realize that Christ is the Head over all things to the church, His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
The dispensation which God purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times
In order to understand what the dispensation of the grace of God is, we need to see that in eternity past God purposed a plan
Man was created not to be an instrument, but a vessel to contain God so that God may be expressed from within man
Satan's rebellion serves in the same way as the black background of a painting that makes the main object all the more outstanding
Satan injected himself into man, the center of the universe, and from man Satan's poison has spread everywhere
The element of death has spread into every part of God's creation, causing the creation to collapse into a heap
Now instead of life, there is death everywhere: in the offices, factories, businesses, schools, and even in the so-called churches
God has come to work Himself into man, not into man as originally created by Him, but into the man whom Satan has injected with himself
Even after we have received Christ, the enemy may inject still more of the factor of death into us and cause us to collapse once again
When the breath of life entered into these dead bones, they firstly rose up and then became attached to one another
After coming into the church life, we had the deep sense that we were more and more upright and that we were becoming more attached
A number of times, however, the power of death has worked even in the church to inject the factor of death into the members of the church
When the factor of death gets into certain members, they are poisoned and spread the poison of death to others
Although Satan's injection has no administration, God's working of Himself into us does have an administration
According to ancient custom, there was a steward in the royal family, and his ministry was called a stewardship
A steward was not a mere slave, but a person intimately related to the family, one who took care of the household arrangement
She controls them by means of a sweet dispensation, a dispensation that is also a kind of administration and intimate service
We have seen that Satan's injection has no administration or stewardship because he subtly injects himself into us
By this dispensation of grace, the dispensing of God Himself as our enjoyment, the factor of life is ministered into the chosen ones
There is no need for anyone to tell you to have fellowship with others, for you automatically long to be attached
God's way to head us up is to work Himself as the factor of life into us that we may rise up and be attached to one another
It is not by a governmental administration, but by a sweet dispensation, an intimate stewardship, a comfortable household arrangement
Through this dispensation, the life factor is ministered to all the members of the church that they may rise up and be attached in the Body
According to the record of the Bible, we may say that prior to the millennium there are just three ages, the ages of Adam, Moses, and Christ
Altogether there are four ages: the age of sin, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom
The ages of Adam and Moses have been completed, the age of grace is being completed, and the age of the millennium has not yet begun
Another teaching is that a dispensation refers to the way God deals with people during a particular period of time
As we have pointed out, when Satan, the power of death, injected himself into man, Satan became death and darkness to man
We need to keep in mind that Satan came in to deaden God's creation and that death ruins and darkness confuses
It may surprise you to know that God's dispensation at the present time is even greater than it was at the time of the Apostle Paul
In place of death, there will be a new environment, a new sphere, a new circumference, in the center of which will be the New Jerusalem
Out of the throne flows the river of water of life; it flows down the mountain and reaches the twelve gates of the city
We see the ultimate, the consummate, dispensation: the dispensing of the Triune God into the whole city of New Jerusalem
God on the throne refers to the Father, the Lamb refers to the Son, and the river of water of life refers to the Spirit
In Revelation 21 we see the Head, the Body surrounding the Head, and all the nations walking in the light of the city
In the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as the center, all things will be headed up in Christ
Everything will be in good order, headed up under Christ, the unique Head, to express the Triune God in eternity
As those in the miniature, we are enjoying the dispensation of life with light, and we are being headed up in Christ
They will praise God because we, the sons of God, will be the center, the focal point, of God's operation in the universe
The angels and the positive things in the universe are like the spokes, and we, the sons of God, are like the hub
The angels, the nations, and all the positive things surrounding us will behold us and spontaneously utter praise to God
Many, including us, may read Ephesians again and again without seeing this because they do not have the proper concept
If we are willing to drop our concepts the spirit of wisdom will replace our natural concepts with something spiritual heavenly and eternal
Those who are poor in spirit seem to know nothing, for they have been emptied of every concept, doctrine, and teaching
It means that we shall be the cause of the praise uttered by the angels and all the positive things in the universe
If the believers were the glory of Paul, then they were certainly the glory of God, for Paul was God's sent one
With joy He will be able to say to the angels and all the positive things in the universe that we are His glory
Verse 10, which speaks of heading up all things in Christ, ends with the words 'in Him,' and verse 11 begins with the words 'in Whom'
Paul wrote this way purposely in order to emphasize the fact that all things in heaven and on earth are headed up in Christ
Although we have been made an inheritance already, we need to ask ourselves whether or not we live as God's inheritance
In ourselves we certainly are not worthy to be God's inheritance, but we have been made an inheritance in the heading-up Christ
According to our natural being, we are not worth anything, but in the heading-up Christ we were made God's inheritance
In this process the natural life must be eliminated, and the gold, the divine nature, must increase by being wrought into more of our being
When this process has been completed, we shall be fully the inheritance of God not only objectively, but also subjectively
The more we are willing to be headed up in Christ, the more the gold, the divine element, will increase within us
We have already been placed in the heading-up Christ, but we are still in the process of being made His inheritance in full
Verse 11 says that we have been made an inheritance according to the purpose of the One who operates all things
There is a difference between God's will and His counsel: the will refers to His intention, and the counsel, to the consideration
In the Lord's recovery we are held responsible to afford the Lord the opportunity to do this finer work upon us
We want to cooperate with God that He may come in to do a fine work among us to bring forth the highest appreciation in the universe
Whenever the angels look at us, they will appreciate what God has done and utter praise to the very God expressed by us
We need to go on until we, the New Testament believers, become the cause of the universal angelic praise of the glory of God
We, the believers of the New Testament, are those who have first hoped in Christ; that is, we have hoped in Him in this age
Because we are full of hope in Christ, we can be made the cause of the universal and angelic praise of God's glory
At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God
The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God's image signified by the seal, thus making us like God
One of the pictures in this booklet showed a dove, signifying the Holy Spirit, flying away from a believer who had grieved Him
When you bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God upon you, you bear the image of God and the expression of God
Whenever we come to know a certain truth or doctrine apart from experience, we shall eventually be troubled by our lack of experience
We are God's acquired possession, and the redemption of the acquired possession is the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body
Many of us can testify from experience that when we believed in the Lord Jesus, we realized that we had been sealed in our spirit
If we begin to argue with others over teachings, it will become apparent that our mind does not bear the image of God
Eventually, you may become so angry with a brother over doctrine that you decide to no longer fellowship with him
With many believers, the struggle of the sealing of the Spirit to get into the mind, emotion, and will lasts a long time
The sealing of the Holy Spirit is still going on and it will continue to go on until the redemption of our body
We have seen from 1:13 and 14 that we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit unto the redemption of the acquired possession
The Greek word for pledge in verse 14 also means foretaste guarantee token payment guaranteeing the full payment a part payment in advance
The Greek word for 'pledge' is somewhat equal to today's down payment, which indicates good faith and is a guarantee of coming payments
Pledge, earnest, and guarantee- all these words are about the same in meaning, all referring to a payment that guarantees the balance
As those who are to inherit God, we have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, guarantee, earnest, and down payment of our inheritance
Corinthians 1:21 says, 'Now he who firmly attaches us with you unto the anointed One, and hath anointed us, is God'
Many of the older brothers and sisters have received hundreds of coatings, but the younger ones have received just a few
The sealing of the Holy Spirit brings in the image, the appearance, and the expression, for the seal bears the sign, the form
God is not only anointing us with His essence; He is also sealing us with His appearance, image, and expression
If the Spirit were only the anointing and the sealing, we might become bored with the experience of the Spirit
When some hear about receiving more of God, they may wonder what we mean by more of God and may even regard such a saying as heretical
Many of the older brothers and sisters can testify that throughout the years their appetite for God has been increasing
The more we taste of Him, the bigger is our appetite for Him; and the more appetite we have, the more we taste Him
Because many Christians care for doctrine but neglect the anointing the sealing and the pledging they miss the experience of the Triune God
The Bible reveals that the Triune God is not for us to learn about as a mere doctrine, but for us to experience
Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance 'unto the redemption of the acquired possession'
Redemption here refers to the redemption of our body , that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious one
We, God's redeemed ones, the church, are God's possession acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ
Because verse 14 ends with the words, 'to the praise of His glory,' we need to consider this matter once again
The phrase 'to the praise of His glory' is repeated three times because the Trinity is involved in God's blessing
Eventually, the whole universe will praise God for His purpose, for His accomplishment, and for His application
They believe in Jehovah God only as the Creator and refuse to admit that God is the God of the Lord Jesus Christ
Wisdom is in our spirit that we may know the mystery of God, and revelation is of God's Spirit to show us the vision by opening the veil
Although he was clever in business, he was lacking in wisdom and could not understand when we spoke about the Scriptures
Some may have the wisdom without the opening of the door; others may have the opening of the door without wisdom
We may have the mystery of God's will and the revelation, but we still need eyes, the spiritual faculty to see
If we would have a pure heart, we must deal with our whole heart, that is, with all the parts that compose our heart
Along with this our heart must have a cold and sober mind, a hot and loving emotion, and a soft and submissive will
Bible teachers use this word to describe the taking up because, according to them, being taken up is a kind of ecstasy
Although the rapture is an aspect of the hope of God's calling, this hope depends upon whether or not we live by the Lord
Some hold the concept that no matter what they are doing or where they are, they will be raptured when the Lord comes back
If we lived in His appearing, we would certainly refrain from quarreling; we would not want to be found arguing when the Lord appears
If you read the New Testament, especially the Epistles, you will see that the Apostles lived with the appearing of the Lord in view
If we take seriously the matters of the Lord's appearing and the kingdom, they will greatly affect our daily living
Many Christians, however, talk a great deal about the rapture and the Lord's coming; but after their talk they indulge in worldly amusements
If we live a life of failure, defeat, dishonesty, unfaithfulness, and rebellion, the Lord's coming will not be an ecstasy, but a judgment
By the Lord's grace, we in the Lord's recovery must come up to His standard and live the life that He requires
In the Gospel of Matthew the slothful slaves are put into outer darkness, and the faithful ones are brought into the enjoyment of the Lord
Most Christians say that as long as we have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, everything related to us will be all right in the next age
Peter 3:13 says, 'Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness'
God's calling includes not only selection, predestination, redemption, sealing, and pledging, but a splendid future
Human humility, however, is not the real humility; it is simply the form of the genuine humility, which is the divine humility
Nearly all who seek the Lord still live in a natural way and condemn only their natural evil, not their natural goodness
They weigh themselves according to an ethical scale, according to good and bad, right and wrong, love and hate
The Spirit's sealing is that we may be transformed into God's image, fully saturated with Him in order to bear His appearance
God is rich in attributes and virtues such as love, life, light, humility, righteousness, holiness, and long-suffering
Now we can see that hope and glory are the result of the five blessings, of the five items of God's well-speaking concerning us
Although hope and glory may be somewhat objective, the surpassing greatness of God's power toward us is very subjective and experiential
It is like the electrical power that is continually being transmitted from the power plant to our building for our daily life
Verse 19 also says that the greatness of God's power is 'according to the operation of the might of His strength'
The surpassingly great power of God toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength which He wrought in Christ
In verse 21 Paul says that Christ has been seated above all rule, authority, power, and lordship and above every name that is named
The authorities here include not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, good or bad, but also the human, earthly ones
Although you may be put in a wonderful room, you will be in darkness unless you know where the light switch is
If we knew the surpassing greatness of the divine power that operated in Christ, we would never again use our weakness as an excuse
The divine power can raise us up from among the dead, even if, like Lazarus, we are dead, buried, and stinking
If you saw that this power toward us is the power that raised Christ from among the dead, would you still say that you are weak?
Do not say that there are still weak ones among us, for we all are stronger than David, even as strong as Jesus Christ
We are in Christ's transcendency, far above all things, including all demons, evil angels, principalities, and powers
Before the astronauts were launched toward the moon, they had the full assurance that they had the power to reach the moon and land there
The truth is that we are far above all and that the divine power has subjected all things including every difficult situation under our feet
We thank the Lord also for the heading-up power, the power that gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church
If we have the full knowledge of this power and live by it, we shall have a wonderful church life, a church life without any problems
If we claim to know God without knowing these three things, then we know God merely in an objective way, not in an experiential way
They know God as the object of their belief and worship, but they do not know Him subjectively as their hope, glory, and power
God will work within us to make us worthy, precious, and valuable, a unique treasure in the universe as an inheritance for Him
The New Jerusalem will be the embodiment of holiness, a composition of the sons of God, and a mutual inheritance for God and man
Although we cannot see it, it is a fact that Christ has resurrected from among the dead and has been seated in the heavens far above all
It is a fact that all things have been subjected under His feet and that He is the Head over all things to the church
1:22 says, 'And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church'
Within this power, therefore, there is the power of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
By the time this God was born into you, He had already passed through creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
At the time you believed, something happened to you and in you, although you might not have understood what it was
Whether you are aware of it or not, there is a transmission taking place from the third heaven, the place where God is, into us
We need to read these verses in Ephesians again and again until we are deeply impressed with them and can speak them forth
Eventually, through our faith in this transmission and through our speaking it forth, the church will come forth in a practical way
How much better is this kind of speaking than vain talk about the brothers and sisters or the situation in the church!
Talking about the saints does not lift us up and strengthen us; on the contrary, it brings us down and weakens us
Let us speak 1:19-23 and forget about the situation with the churches, the elders, and the brothers and sisters
As we speak, we shall experience the heavenly transmission, and we all shall be infused with the Triune God as the all-inclusive power
Those who emphasize the objective teachings of the Bible claim that our crucifixion with Christ took place once for all
On the one hand, Christ's death is once for all; but on the other hand, it is a matter that continues throughout our Christian life
Christ is Head over all things to the church, and the surpassing greatness of the power that operated in Him is toward us who believe
The divine power is not transmitted to the church once for all; on the contrary, it is transmitted continually
Electricity was installed in our meeting hall once for all, but now electricity is being transmitted into the building continually
The Body is not an organization it is an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head
The Body is the issue of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ who has descended to the church
After terminating all these things through His crucifixion, Christ entered into resurrection to germinate something new
Although God was living, moving, and acting in Jesus, there was no way to have the Body, for at that time Jesus was not the Head
By Christ's all-inclusive death, the old creation, including our old man, our flesh, and our natural being, was terminated
The church, the Body, is an entity altogether in resurrection and ascension with both the natural elements and the old creation terminated
The Body, an organism in resurrection and ascension, is wholly in the new creation and has nothing to do with the old creation
Ephesians 1 begins with the well-speaking of God and ends with the Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
All that the Triune God has passed through, including incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, is transmitted to the church
The church has absolutely nothing to do with the old creation, which was terminated on the cross and buried with Christ in the tomb
The issue of such a divine dispensation into our humanity is the fullness of Him who fills all in all and the praise of His expressed glory
Although we cannot find the word 'dispensed,' we do have the word 'dispensation' , which indicates the act of dispensing
We have pointed out that God is constituting us a treasure, a valuable and precious inheritance, by working Himself into us
Is it by following certain so-called holiness teachings about matters such as clothing, make-up, and hairstyles?
Some Christian teachers say that to be holy is to be separated; they argue against the concept that holiness is sinless perfection
It covers only the positional aspect of sanctification; it does not touch the dispositional aspect revealed in Romans 6
When God is dispensed into us and wrought into our being and we are saturated with Him, our disposition is sanctified
We have pointed out that this seal is living and moving within us; the Spirit is constantly sealing us with God's essence
When the New Jerusalem comes, we shall see that it will be altogether a valuable inheritance, shining with God's glory
The fact that the saints are becoming God's glorious inheritance, a precious treasure to Him, indicates that He is working Himself into us
As we have pointed out, the words 'to the church' in verse 22 imply a transmission, which is an act of dispensing
Whatever Christ has passed through, accomplished, obtained, and attained is now being transmitted into the church
Our responsibility now is not to imitate the ink or to copy it; on the contrary, it is to soak it up, that is, to be saturated with it
By being thoroughly saturated with the heavenly ink, we become the ink; for the ink is assimilated into our being
If we grasp this basic concept, our Christian life will be revolutionized and our concepts will be radically changed
The Triune God is dispensed and wrought into us in the Body, the fullness of the all-filling Christ, that we may be His full expression
When God selected us, His intention was not that we wear a certain style of clothing or comb our hair in a particular way
According to the commonly-accepted Christian teaching, we shall one day suddenly find ourselves transported into a realm of glory
When we open ourselves, this power comes into function to saturate us with the divine essence transmitted into us from the heavens
If we would experience a continual transmission, we need to repent, confess, and make a clearance of all hindrances
It is in the dispensing of the Triune God into us and His working of Himself into our being that we are the church
The church is the issue of God's well-speaking, the basic factor of which is the Triune God dispensed and wrought into us
Ephesians 2 is not mainly concerned with the pitiful situation of fallen man, but with the producing and building of the church
At the end of chapter one, we see the church as the Body of Christ being produced out of the transmission of the ascended Christ
In chapter two Paul looks at the church from the bottom, the church from the viewpoint of the miserable situation of fallen man
The last verse of chapter one reveals that the church, the Body of Christ, has been produced by Christ through His attainment
The conjunction 'and' at the beginning of 2:1 is significant in bringing together these two aspects of the church
According to Romans 1:16 and 17, the gospel of God is powerful unto salvation because God's righteousness is revealed in it
Many Christians are not clear about the difference between salvation through righteousness and salvation through life
As sinners and dead people, we needed both righteousness and life, both the salvation in Romans and the salvation in Ephesians
Others, however, may think nothing of walking through someone's home and even of examining the various things there
You do not have this right, unless you are responsible to clean the hall or to collect lost items for lost and found
Referring to our offenses and sins, verse 2 says, 'In which you once walked according to the age of this world'
All the time that we were dead in offenses and sins, we were very active in the world, in the realm of the satanic kingdom
Once we also were dead and carried away by the tide of the age, but now that we have been made alive, the current cannot move us
Before we were saved, we all behaved ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, doing whatever the flesh and the thoughts liked to do
If you ask the young people why they do certain things, many of them would answer that they simply like to do them
The likes of the flesh in verse 3 refer to evil things, and the likes of the thoughts refer to things that may be somewhat better
The world is outside of us, the lusts are within us, and the evil spiritual atmosphere is both above us and within us
Hallelujah, although we were dead and in such a deplorable condition, we have been saved to become the Body of Christ!
In this message we come to 2:4-10, a portion of Ephesians which reveals that we have been saved by grace to be the masterpiece of God
The object of love should be in a condition deserving love, but the object of mercy is always in a pitiful situation
Because of His great love, God is rich in mercy to save us from our wretched position to a condition which is suitable for His love
God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself , into our deadened spirit through His Spirit of life
In God's view we were all raised up together, just as all the Israelites were raised up together from the death waters of the Red Sea
In the book of Romans, Christ as our righteousness has brought us into such a state that we may be acceptable to God
In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into such a position that we may be above all God's enemies
God's salvation by life has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic
When we meet together, we often have the deep sense that we are not in an earthly atmosphere, but in a heavenly atmosphere
If you go to a theater or some other worldly place, you will have the sense that you are immersed in an earthly atmosphere
Because we are in a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly nature and a heavenly characteristic, we are a heavenly people
In Romans, however, to be transferred from Adam into Christ is primarily a matter of being placed into a justified position
In Ephesians to be in Christ is not only a matter of a heavenly position, but, even more important, a matter of life
Verse 7 says, 'That He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus'
The church is produced in the present age; the ages which are coming are the ages of the millennium and eternity future
We have emphasized that the governing concept in Ephesians 1 is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being
According to Ephesians, salvation is the transmission of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ into us
Once we receive such a divine transmission, we are made alive, raised up, and seated with Christ in the heavenlies
In the ages to come-in the millennium and eternity future-God will display this grace publicly to the whole universe
At the time we repented and made confession to God in the name of the Lord Jesus, the believing ability was put into us
The Greek word poiema means something which has been made, a handiwork, or something which has been written or composed as a poem
Poetry does not consist only of poetic writing; any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design may be considered a poem
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are the highest poetry, expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
Because we see things from the side of the messed-up 'kitchen' of the church life, we may not realize that the church is such a masterpiece
As the masterpiece of God's work, we, the church, are an absolutely new item in the universe, something newly originated by God
As we have already pointed out, this masterpiece is a poem, an artistic work that expresses the wisdom, design, and beauty of the maker
In the ages to come in the millennium and in eternity there will be a unique hymn the church which will express the wisdom and design of God
When we see the New Jerusalem, we may extol God for the beauty, wisdom, and design manifested in this marvelous production
Finally, we are God's masterpiece created in Christ Jesus 'for good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them'
2:4-10 reveals that we have been saved by grace to be God's masterpiece that we may walk in the good works prepared before by God
Because in the eyes of God fallen man has become flesh, the Bible says, 'By the works of law no flesh shall be justified before Him'
Because his whole being had become the flesh, man was damaged and thus prevented from fulfilling God's purpose
The fact that the called race was circumcised meant that they were separated from fallen mankind and delivered out of the fallen condition
Verse 11 says that the nations in the flesh were 'called uncircumcision by those who are called circumcision in the flesh made by hand'
Christ, in whom all God's blessings to His chosen people are embodied, came out of Israel, the circumcised people
Since we, the uncircumcised Gentiles, were separated from Israel, we were apart from Christ, having nothing to do with Christ
The 'commonwealth' here refers to the citizenship, the civil rights, of God's chosen people, including God's ruling, blessing, and presence
Eventually, God's promise became the binding covenant because it had been legalized by the necessary procedures
Both in the Old Testament and the New Testament God's words of promise have been legalized to become a binding covenant
All the words God spoke to His chosen people, from Abraham to Malachi, are His promises legalized to be His covenants
Because these words have been legalized to be God's covenant, the Old Testament is called a testament, which is another term for covenant
God is in Christ; He rules and moves in the commonwealth of Israel; and He bestows His blessings according to His covenants
When we were apart from Christ, the commonwealth of Israel, and the covenants of God's promise, we were without God
Before we were saved, we lived in the world, where we had no hope, no expectation, and no God for our enjoyment
Ephesians 2:13 says, 'But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ'
Because we were separated from Israel, out of which Christ came, we were separated from Christ and had nothing to do with Him
We have pointed out that once we were far off from Christ, from the commonwealth of Israel, and from the covenants of God's promise
The Jews are still expecting the Messiah to come; however, they do not realize how much they need Messiah's redemption
The transfer from our former status to our new status in Christ actually was accomplished by the redemption of Christ
In other words in this heavenly position we are one with God one with the proper Israel one with Gods covenants and one with Gods blessings
Because we have been transferred out of the former status and into a new status, we can participate in all that is of God
We have been saved from our fallen condition by life, and we have been transferred out of our former status by the redemption of Christ
Christ who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers is Himself our peace our harmony in that He made both one
Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles
The commandments regarding circumcision and the eating regulations were ritual commandments, not moral commandments
The three main ordinances in Judaism were circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, and the dietary regulations
In Philippians 3 he even used a new derogatory term, the 'concision,' to replace the honorable term, 'circumcision'
Whether a person is allowed to eat pork or is required to keep the Sabbath or practice circumcision depends upon the age in which he lives
The ritual commandments concerning diet were given so that God's chosen people would be careful to keep themselves clean
The cloven hoof symbolizes discernment in walking; it indicates that we should not walk in any place that is defiled
It is even possible for the practice of pray-reading to become a middle wall of partition and a source of enmity
Although we may not approve of certain practices, we should go along with them in order to give no ground for ordinances
Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances
In the various countries where the recovery is growingfor example in Japan Korea and Indonesiathere are ways of living different from ours
Certainly the Lord's recovery cannot require the Japanese, Koreans, and Indonesians to have the same way of living
The Americans and Europeans use a knife and fork, the Chinese use chop sticks, and the Indonesians use their fingers
Due to the improvements in transportation and communication, the people of the world are becoming intermingled more and more
Concerning our way of life, we all must learn not to impose requirements on others and not to have any ordinances
If we are willing to let go of our cultural pride, it will be possible for the Lord to have the proper church life
Because mankind became flesh and was thus kept from God and His purpose, God ordained His chosen people to be circumcised from the flesh
We have seen that, according to the Bible, the basic ordinances are those regarding circumcision, the Sabbath, and diet
We shall enjoy the church life as the new man, the commonwealth of God, the household of God, and the dwelling place of God
When Christ died on the cross, not only did He deal with sins, the old man, Satan, and the world; He also dealt with the ordinances
By His death on the cross, Christ dealt with five categories of things: sins, the old man, Satan, the world, and the ordinances
We have heard repeatedly that on the cross Christ accomplished redemption, destroyed the Devil, judged the world, and crucified the self
Both peoples were created in Christ with the divine essence into one new entity, which is a corporate man, the church
The Brethren emphasized this aspect of the church and even translated the Greek word ecclesia into assembly which is an accurate rendering
These four concepts of the church are like four levels in the educational system: kindergarten, elementary, high school, and college
We need to advance from the kindergarten level of the church, that of the assembly, to the college level, that of the one new man
We are not only members of God's family, but also members of the Body of Christ, where the relationship among the members is still closer
The family is more intimate than the assembly, the Body is much higher than the family, and the new man is higher than the Body
Of using the word man in these two verses this version says in verse 22 to lay aside the old self and in verse 24 to put on the new self
The Revised Standard Version is also greatly in error by adopting the renderings, 'put off your old nature' and 'put on the new nature'
These errors came in because the translators responsible for them did not have the proper concept or knowledge
Because the new man is created of two peoples, the Jewish and Gentile believers, it must be a corporate entity
The corporate man created by God was damaged through the fall, and there is now the need for God to have a new man
When Christ was nailed to the cross in the flesh, the entire old creation was involved, for all of creation was related to His flesh
If you ask an unbelieving Jew who it was that was crucified on the cross, he will answer, 'The man Jesus of Nazareth'
An even more advanced Christian would respond that the Savior, he himself, and the Devil were all crucified on the cross
If this question is addressed to us, we should include in our answer not only the five items already mentioned, but also the ordinances
Christ abolished in His flesh the law of commandments in ordinances; but He did not create the new man in His flesh
In the flesh He terminated the negative things so that He might create the two, the Jews and the Gentiles, into one new man in Himself
The negative things were terminated in Christ's flesh, whereas the new man, which, of course, is positive, was germinated in Christ Himself
As we have pointed out again and again, death is the threshold of resurrection; it ushers us into resurrection
It was in His flesh that we, the old man, were terminated, but it is in the wonderful Spirit that we have been created into the one new man
In the creation of the one new man, however, God's nature has been wrought into man to make His divine nature one entity with humanity
For this reason, the demonic powers would try to keep Christians from seeing the fact of the creation of the one new man
We shall see that we and all the creatures, signified by the cherubim on the veil, were crucified in the flesh of Christ on the cross
We all need to be profoundly impressed with the fact that we, the believers, have been created into one new man in Christ
In type, the ancient city of Jerusalem was God's dwelling place, but today God's dwelling place is in our spirit
In considering the matter of our spirit, we need to drop all this and see that our spirit is universally spacious
The words 'our spirit' include Paul's spirit, Martin Luther's spirit, John Wesley's spirit, Brother Nee's spirit, your spirit, and my spirit
The way to put on the new man is for our spirit in which are found God Gods dwelling place and the new man to become the spirit of our mind
For the spirit to become the spirit of our mind means that the spirit directs, controls, dominates, and possesses our mind
When this is the case, our being is under the control of our spirit, in which are found God, the dwelling place of God, and the new man
There is no room for our way, because our whole being is dominated, controlled, governed, and directed by our spirit
Now day by day we need to put on this new man by permitting the spirit to control our being and renew our mind
Because the new man has been created in Christ and with Christ according to God, the new man bears the image of God
By being renewed in the governing spirit of our mind, we put on this new man that has been created in Christ Jesus
How can the new man be both created, which has nothing to do with anything old, and renewed, which is related to something old?
As we pointed out in the previous message, the new man has been created, but now our need is to put him on in our experience
The putting on of a suit of clothes, however, is not a fully accurate picture of the putting on of the new man
By this we see that the putting on of the new man is not an outward, objective matter, but an inward, subjective experience
We have pointed out that on the cross Christ has slain the ordinances in order to produce the one new man in resurrection
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the life-giving Spirit came into our spirit, bringing with Him the new man as a finished product
Both Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3 indicate that in order to put on the new man, we first need to put off the old man
Perhaps you worked five days a week and then in the evenings or on the weekends amused yourself with certain worldly entertainments
We should not be swept along by the current of this age; instead, we should bury our former manner of life and even hold a funeral for it
The actual putting off of the old man is the putting off of the former manner of life which always involves ordinances and our way of living
When Paul wrote the Epistle to the Colossians, there were Jews in virtually every city in the Mediterranean area
When the Jews and the Greeks in a particular city were saved, they came together as the church in that locality
In some cities it was possible for the church to include cultured Greeks, religious Jews, Barbarians, and uncultured Scythians
In order for them to have the church life, they had to put off the old man embodied in their former manner of life
People with completely different temperaments, some outwardly expressive and others silent and mysterious, are brought together
Through regeneration the one new man has been put into us those who formerly had been under the influence of the differences caused by Babel
When we come together for the practice of the genuine church life, we must all put off our national heritage and forget it
On the positive side, we need to see that the new man has already been created and, by regeneration, has been put into our spirit
Colossians 3:10 reveals that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge, which is according to the image of God
In our experience the new man must be renewed unto the full knowledge that is according to the image, the expression, of God who created him
In our experience of the new man, the new man is gradually renewed unto a full knowledge according to the image of the Creator
We must allow our spirit to become the leading, dominating, directing, and governing element of our whole being
Ephesians 2:16 says, 'And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it'
We, the believers, both Jews and Gentiles, were reconciled not only for the Body of Christ, but also in the Body of Christ
Verse 17 says, 'And coming, He preached the gospel of peace to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near'
We have been reconciled to God positionally for salvation, and we have access unto the Father experientially for enjoyment
Because the aspect of the church as the Body is not as high as that of the new man, we may think that the Body should be mentioned first
Paul firstly said that Christ's death on the cross abolished in His flesh the ordinances in order to create in Himself the one new man
When Christ created the two, the Jews and the Gentiles, into one new man, He reconciled them in one Body to God
After being reconciled to God, there was still the need for the Jews and the Gentiles to have access unto the Father for enjoyment
We may have God in fact by being in the Body, but if we would enjoy the Father in experience, we must be in the Spirit
Strangers are aliens, and sojourners are foreigners sojourning among the Israelites without the right of citizenship
All the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, are citizens of God's kingdom, which is a sphere wherein God exercises His authority
God's house is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers were born of God into His house to enjoy His riches
We have both the individual aspect of the Christian life and the corporate aspect in the house of God and the kingdom of God
As unsaved Gentiles, we once were far off from God and the commonwealth of Israel, but now we have an intimate relationship with the saints
No matter what our background may be, as believers we all are members of God's unique universal family, and all the saints are our folks
In verse 21 we see the universal aspect of the church: 'All the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord'
In verse 22 we have the local aspect: 'You also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
Verse 20 says, 'Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone'
The foundation of the apostles and prophets is the revelation they received regarding Christ and the church for the building of the church
The so-called churches established according to nationalities are not built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets
The apostles and prophets, however, never received a revelation that the presbytery should be the foundation of the church
The Methodist Church is built upon the principles of John Wesley, and the Catholic Church is built upon the concept of hierarchy
If the revelation given to the apostles and prophets were applied to the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church would collapse
The churches in the Lord's recovery are built according to the revelation received by the apostles and prophets
By this word the Lord revealed that after His resurrection He would become the cornerstone to join the Jews and the Gentiles
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved'
God's intention in saving us is not to bring us into the heavens; rather, it is to join us to the Jews so that He may have His building
Whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we have been saved in order to be joined together in Christ for God's building
The fact that the temple is still growing indicates that, from our point of view at least, the temple of God is not complete
Verse 21 does not say that all the building has grown into a holy temple; it says that all the building is growing into a holy temple
If you consider the past nineteen centuries of church history, you may find it difficult to see the growth of the building
The church is the place where God's people contact God, worship Him, and receive His word, and it is also the place of God's rest
The church in Anaheim does not have one building; the church in Chicago, another; and the church in New York, still another
The stewardship of the grace is the dispensing of the grace of God into God's chosen people for the producing and building up of the church
Out of this stewardship comes the ministry of the apostle who is a steward in Gods house ministering Christ as Gods grace to Gods household
Because our Father has such vast riches, there is the need in His household for many stewards to dispense these riches to His children
Although Paul was a steward, in 3:1 he referred to himself as 'the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you, the nations'
On the basis of such a status, the status of his actual living as a prisoner in Christ, he besought the saints
In beseeching the saints to walk worthily of God's calling, he spoke from his status as the prisoner of the Lord
It would be a great loss for us not to have this book in the New Testament, for Ephesians contains the highest revelation in the Bible
If Christ is our prison, our eyes will be opened to see the heavenly vision, and we shall receive the highest revelation
Paul saw this vision on behalf of the saints, for as he says in 3:1, he was a prisoner on behalf of the Gentiles
Many Christians read Ephesians again and again without seeing the revelation contained in it because they are not imprisoned in Christ
A stewardess on an airplane dispenses food to the passengers; she does not dispense information on how to cook
All the saints, no matter how insignificant they may seem to be, have a stewardship according to God's economy
In the past we have pointed out that the heavens are for the earth, that the earth is for man, and that man is for God
For the fulfillment of this purpose, God created the heavens for the earth, the earth for man, and man for Himself
We have seen that the desire of God's heart is to dispense His riches, which actually are Himself, into His chosen people
When we carry out our stewardship by dispensing Christ into others, it becomes the dispensation of God into them
Go to school or to work for the purpose of carrying out your stewardship according to God's economy for His dispensation
The word 'minister' corresponds to the word 'steward,' for a steward is one who serves by dispensing the necessities of life to others
If the blood does not flow into my hand, my hand will be short of life and therefore will not be able to function
Paul's ministry was not only to save sinners, but to produce the church for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose
He was a faithful minister, one who ministered Christ to the members of the Body so that Christ might be expressed in the Body
We also become ministers dispensing the riches of Christ to the members of the Body so that the Body may be built up
Having considered the stewardship of the grace in the previous message, we need now to see the revelation of the mystery
If they had been asked what God's economy is, they would have been unable to answer, for during their time the mystery was still veiled
God's economy, the dispensing of Himself into man to produce a Body for His Son, had not been revealed to them
God's economy is to dispense Himself into a great number of human beings in order to produce a Body for this embodiment of Himself
Although many political leaders and dignitaries know nothing about this great mystery, by God's mercy we know what it is
By revelation this great mystery, which had been hidden until the coming of the Lord Jesus, has been unveiled to us
According to Paul's own word, the apostles and prophets were not extraordinary, for Paul said that he was less than we are
On the one hand we may regard the apostles and prophets as extraordinary but on the other hand we should consider them the same as we are
As he made this exhortation, he presented himself as an example, saying that he was less than the least of all saints
Even a young sister in junior high school is one sent to school by the Lord to minister Christ to her teachers and classmates
Contrary to the concept of many Christians, a prophet is not primarily one who predicts the future; he is a spokesman for God
According to Hebrews 3, Moses, one called by God and sent to the children of Israel, was an apostle; he typified Christ as God's Apostle
When the Lord called him and sent him out as an apostle, Moses was timid and claimed that he could not speak well
The young people are sent to school as apostles, but when they open their mouths to speak on behalf of the Lord, they are prophets
It is a shame to be a Christian for years without ever going to someone with the burden to minister Christ to him
In Catholicism Peter has been elevated to be a pope, and others have been given high positions in the so-called holy service
All believers are in the holy service, and all of us could be called 'popes,' because the word 'pope' simply means 'father'
Even the least among the saints in the Lord's recovery may be sent forth to be such a 'pope,' a genuine father
When you contact people for Christ, you must let them know in a proper way that you have seen something they have not seen
It is by having this revelation that we have the boldness to say that we are God's sent ones and God's spokesmen
The word 'spirit' here refers to the human spirit of the apostles and prophets, a spirit regenerated and indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God
The revelation received by the apostles and prophets is not a revelation of the many secondary matters in the Bible
The term joint Body indicates that the saved Gentiles are joined with the saved Jews to be the one Body of Christ for His unique expression
According to God's intention, the church is to express His multifarious wisdom to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies
The producing of the church to be the Body of Christ is according to the eternal purpose which God made in Christ in eternity past
Because Paul's walk was governed by his revelation of Christ, he could not keep from speaking of the riches of Christ
In 3:8 Paul said that he was less than the least of all saints; yet he could preach the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel
In order to be apostles, prophets, stewards, ministers, and even prisoners in Christ, we need to know the unsearchable riches of Christ
Elsewhere in the Bible we see that the vine tree, the apple tree, the cedar, and the cypress are all types of Christ
At the time of the Passover, the children of Israel ate not only the lamb, but also unleavened bread and bitter herbs
Because these riches are so vast, it is difficult for anyone to say how many types of Christ there are in the Old Testament
All the types, shadows, and figures of Christ in the Old Testament are descriptions, explanations, and definitions of what Christ is
When we experience and enjoy the very Christ who is dispensed into us, we become part of the proper church life
Throughout the years of his growth and development, he has consumed a great deal of meat, poultry, vegetables, and fruit
The riches of American foodstuffs did not make him this fullness until he ate them, digested them, and assimilated them
All the aspects of the riches of Christ do not become the fullness of Christ until they are eaten, enjoyed, digested, and assimilated by us
Verse 9 says And to bring to light what is the dispensation of the mystery which from the ages has been hidden in God Who created all things
Chapter one speaks of the power of God , chapter two, of the grace of God , and chapter three, of the wisdom of God
If you do not know how to get into your spirit, you may have a great deal of knowledge, but you will not have any wisdom
Verse 10 says that through the church the multifarious wisdom of God is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies
Through the church God makes His wisdom known not mainly to human beings but to those rebellious angels who are the followers of God's enemy
If you are a person full of wisdom, the more troubles and difficulties you have, the more wisdom you will express
If everything related to you is peaceful and without problems, you will have no opportunity to express your wisdom
Through David's fall and repentance combined with God's forgiveness, David gained a son, Solomon, to be the builder of the temple
If you read the Bible with understanding, you will see that David's falls were neither of David nor of God; they were of Satan
When David yielded to these temptations, Satan was pleased, convinced that he had damaged an excellent king whose heart was absolute for God
If we had never been poisoned and corrupted, we would not have needed God very much, and there would have been no need for God's salvation
The more sinful corrupt and damaged we are the greater is our need for God and the more opportunity there is for God to do something for us
In verse 10 Paul declares that God's multifarious wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies through the church
At the time of the fall, Satan as sin entered into man and, in many respects, caused man to be the same as he is
Satan instigated Judas to betray the Lord Jesus, and secondly he stirred up the Jews and the Gentiles to cooperate in crucifying Him
What Satan did not realize, however, was that in putting this One on the cross, he was actually crucifying himself
According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is our wisdom with respect to righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
Only God has the wisdom to initiate such a wonderful thing, to make sinful and corrupted people the members of Christ
Many aspects of God's wisdom are manifested in His making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
In the same principle, our failures, mistakes, defeats, and wrongdoings have also given God opportunities to display His wisdom
It seems as if the amount of mercy and grace received has been in proportion to the seriousness of the mistakes
The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past
It was made in Christ with a threefold intention for God's glory, for the blessing of God's chosen people, and for the shame of God's enemy
Through the faith of Christ, we have such access with boldness in confidence to enjoy God and His eternal plan
We have boldness in Christ we have access to God we have confidence in Gods purpose and we also have the glory in the apostles afflictions
In this message we come to 3:14-17, the first part of Paul's second prayer for the church, the prayer which is related to experience
When some hear that all the saints can be apostles and prophets they may wonder about 1 Corinthians 1229 a verse which says Are all apostles
Because we need to experience Christ in a subjective way, Paul prayed that we would be strengthened with power into the inner man
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
In this declaration of God there is glory, for the declaration of God is the manifestation of God, which is glory
Because the Father is the source, the origin, of every family in the heavens and on earth, every family is His expression
It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God , indwelt by the Spirit of God , and mingled with the Spirit of God
When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, the Lord came into us and regenerated us with Himself as our life
The old person, the soul with the human life, has been crucified on the cross, and now our new person is the spirit with the divine life
The more we are strengthened, the more the parts of our inner being are brought back into the spirit, into our inner man
We need to be strengthened in order to stay in our spirit and not to be distracted by thoughts regarding so many things
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-the mind, the emotion, and the will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
The first three chapters of Ephesians are on the church, and the last three chapters are on the walk worthy of God's calling for the church
In Ephesians 3 Paul presents himself as a pattern of one who could carry out God's eternal purpose concerning the church
We all need to follow Paul in receiving the revelation in our spirit and in being strengthened into our inner man
When Paul bowed his knees to the Father, he was so strong in his inner man that nothing could shake him or disturb him
We also need to be strengthened to such an extent that nothing will be able to carry us away from our inner man
When we are strengthened into our inner man and Christ makes His home in our hearts, we are able to see the revelation
In this message we shall consider the matters of apprehending the dimensions of Christ and of knowing the love of Christ
In verse 18 Paul speaks of the breadth, length, height, and depth, but he does not say to what these dimensions refer
The second 'that' is the result of the first, that the third is the result of the second, and that the fourth is the result of the third
Ephesians 3:19 does not say that we are filled with the riches of God, but that we are filled unto the fullness of God
Chapters one and two cover the revelation of the church, and chapter three covers the constitution of the church
In chapter three we see that Paul, who was a leading one and a pattern, received the revelation and enjoyed the riches of Christ
In order to grasp the dimensions of Christ, we need all the saints; for this we must lay hold of Christ corporately
Now, according to verse 18, we have the boldness to say that Christ is our universe, for His dimensions are the dimensions of the universe
When we enter into the new heaven and the new earth to dwell in the New Jerusalem, we all shall realize that Christ the Lord is our universe
In our experience of Christ, we firstly experience the breadth of what He is, and then we experience the length
If you experience Christ properly and normally as the breadth and the length, you will be kept from going to an extreme
By experiencing Christ continually as the breadth and length our experience will be like a solidly woven carpet not a long single thread
Although he spent very little time in prayer, he was constantly reading the Word and writing notes in his Bible
There is nothing wrong with enjoying the Lord in our homes, but we should not stretch such an experience until it becomes an extreme
What is needed today is not lines of 'thread,' but a 'carpet' woven through the balanced experience of Christ in the church
As we experience Christ in His spreading, we come to see that the dimensions of the universe are the very dimensions of Christ
After we experience the breadth and length of Christ, we begin to experience the height of Christ and then the depth
Our experience of Christ in the church must be 'cubical,' three-dimensional, with many lines going back and forth in all three directions
In speaking of our having been rooted and grounded, Paul indicates that the experience of Christ is for life and building
The love in which we are rooted and grounded is the divine love realized and experienced by us in a practical way
Because Christ is immeasurable, His love is knowledge-surpassing; yet we can know it in our spirit, not by knowledge but by experience
Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable love is like a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience
Christ must make His home in our hearts; He must occupy all the parts of our inner being and saturate them with His riches
When in our experience we are filled unto all the fullness of God, the church comes into being in a practical way
According to this rendering, the fullness of God would have to be the element, the essence, with which we are filled
Paul is saying that we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, we shall be filled to be the expression of God
If the riches had been with Him but the fullness had not, something would have been lacking; there would have been no completion
If you take a piece of candy from a jar filled with candies you will be receiving candy not from the riches of the jar but from its fullness
The Lord Jesus was like the glass, and the riches of God with which He was filled unto all the fullness of God were like the protein drink
The fullness of God is the issue of the believers' being constituted metabolically through their experience of the riches of Christ
When we have experienced Christ to such an extent, we shall be filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God
We need to be strengthened so that the indwelling Christ can spread Himself throughout our being and make His home in our inward parts
We are rooted and grounded in love, we lay hold of the dimensions of Christ, and we know His love that surpasses knowledge
In the light of such a vision we see that it is utterly wrong to regard the church as a material building where 'services' are held
It is also not adequate to view the church merely as the ekklesia, the gathering together of God's called-out people
Although many Christians today use the term 'the Body of Christ,' few have any clear realization of what this term signifies
When we have been filled with all the riches of Christ and metabolically saturated with all that Christ is, we become the fullness of God
Although chapters one and two of Ephesians give us a definition of the church, this definition is still not adequate
We need chapter three to show us how the church is constituted organically and metabolically with the riches of the living Christ
It is at this point that Paul is able to sound a high praise, even a doxology: 'To Him be the glory in the church'
If we are filled with this vision and then go forth to speak for God, we shall surely be God's sent ones and His spokesmen
Wherever you go, you will be a sent one, and whenever you speak this vision, you will be God's spokesman speaking Christ for God's economy
In these verses in chapter three of Ephesians concerning the economy of God resulting in the fullness of God, we see the Triune God
The Father answers and fulfills the apostle's prayer through the Spirit so that Christ, the Son , may make His home in our hearts
Although the church has been on earth for more than nineteen centuries, it has not yet reached the point of being the fullness of God
We must admit that among us today we do not yet have the church as the fullness of God, as God's full expression
The fact that the Lord has spoken such a word concerning the church is an indication that He will do what He has spoken
The words 'but to Him' in verse 20 convey the thought that something has initially gone forth from God and is now returning to Him
Suppose a person who is physically very weak can be strengthened according to someone who is physically strong
In the same principle, to be strengthened into the inner man according to the Father's glory means to have His glory wrought into our being
The word 'but' suggests that the glory which has come to us and which has been wrought into our being is now going back to God with us
Strictly speaking, 'ask or think' here refers to the spiritual things related to the church, not to material things
God's ability to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, as revealed in verse 20, is different from His ability in creation
When we are in a favorable environment, there may be very little opportunity for Christ to spread Himself in our hearts
When we are placed in a difficult environment, the Lord may have more of an opportunity to spread within our inward being
Our asking and our thinking should be focused on God's economy to dispense Himself into us to produce the church as the expression of Christ
When our asking and thinking concern the church, God will always do superabundantly above all that we ask or think
Verse 21 says, 'To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations of the age of the ages
In Christ the sphere is much broader, because Christ is the Head of all the families in the heavens and on earth
God's glorification in Christ is in the realm of all the families created by God, not only on earth but also in the heavens
God's glorification in the church is mainly in this age, whereas God's glorification in Christ is for eternity
According to verse 15, God is the source of the angelic family in the heavens and of all the human families on earth
For God to be glorified in all the ages, from the present age throughout eternity, He must be glorified both in the church and in Christ
In order for the glory of God to be wrought into us, we need to be strengthened into our inner man according to the riches of God's glory
If we take the lead to give glory to God, all the other families both in heaven and on earth will follow us to glorify Him
Ephesians 4:1 says, 'I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called'
In walking worthily of God's calling, the church must have a certain kind of life and also bear responsibility to the full extent
In exhorting the saints to walk worthily of God's calling, Paul spoke from his status as a prisoner in the Lord
In 3:1 Paul speaks of himself as 'the prisoner of Christ Jesus,' but in 4:1 he says that he is 'the prisoner in the Lord'
To walk worthily of God's calling, to have the proper Body life, we need firstly to care for the matter of oneness
Unity is formed by many people uniting together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers making them all one
Some Christians may have a certain kind of unity, but we in the Lord's recovery appreciate oneness much more than unity
Our oneness is not an objective Person far away in the heavens; it is a subjective Person indwelling us as our life
Although there may be dozens of lights in a large room, they are one in the electricity that flows within them
In the illustration of the electricity and the lights, the oneness of the electricity is the electricity itself
It does not mean that there are many kinds of lowliness and meekness; it means that we should have lowliness and meekness in all things
If we do not have such a humanity as our 'capital,' then we cannot operate the 'business' of keeping the oneness of the Spirit
Any meekness or lowliness that we may seem to have in ourselves is a pretense and cannot survive any real testing
By having the humanity of the resurrected Christ, we spontaneously have the virtues required to keep the oneness of the Spirit
The genuine oneness in the Triune God is seen in the picture of the tabernacle with its forty-eight boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold
Romans 84 says That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to spirit
It is useless to charge the new ones to keep the oneness, because keeping the oneness of the Spirit requires transformation
If you have not been transformed, you will not have the lowliness nor the meekness necessary to keep the oneness
Now there is no longer a separation between the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers nor between us and God
For this reason, Paul said that the middle wall of partition has been broken down and that the Jewish and Gentile believers must be one
Often the love between a husband and wife is buried beneath the differences that emerge when they come down from the cross
The first three can be grouped together, the Spirit with the Body as His expression and the Body related to the one hope
The third of the Trinity is mentioned first because the main concern here is the Body, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body
The Body is mentioned before the Spirit because the oneness among us is related to the Body and is for the Body
If we do not see this relationship, we shall not be able to know why Paul put the one Spirit and the one hope together with the one Body
On one hand, we appreciate our bodies because they are useful and because without them we cannot exist in this world
By being sown into the soil and by growing normally, the seed is transfigured into a plant with beautiful blossoms
For this reason, the worldly people treat us the same as everyone else, without any realization that we are sons of God
Neither the transfiguration of our body nor our manifestation as the sons of God will merely be a sudden, unexpected occurrence
If we are honest, we shall admit that the present situation of both ourselves and the church is less than satisfactory
Today the indwelling Spirit is carrying out both the transfiguration of the body and the manifestation of the sons of God
We have not only the one Body with the one Spirit and the one hope, but also the one Lord with the one faith and the one baptism
As soon as a person comes to believe in the Person and work of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, he is made one with Christ
The life-giving Spirit is working within us so that we may be transformed in soul, transfigured in body, and fully manifested as sons of God
Through faith and baptism we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ and have thus been joined to the Lord
The reality of baptism consists in realizing and confessing that our natural being has been crucified and buried
The Originator of our oneness is the Father, the Accomplisher of our oneness is the Lord, and the Executor of our oneness is the Spirit
Although many of us have been Christians for years, we have never heard that oneness is actually the Triune God becoming our experience
The word but at the beginning of verse 7 brings out this contrast between the oneness of the Body and the variety of the gifts or functions
Grace according to the measure of the gift can be compared to our blood, which supplies the members of our body according to their size
Verse 8 continues, 'Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men'
Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had led the way to victory
Those in verse 8 refers to the redeemed saints who had been taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christs death and resurrection
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
The Amplified New Testament renders 'He led a train of vanquished foes' for 'He led captive those taken captive'
Vanquished foes' may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, also indicating Christ's victory over Satan, sin, and death
In His ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes as captives from a war for a celebration of Christ's victory
He died on the cross and descended into Hades, ascended in resurrection from Hades to earth, and then ascended to the third heaven
It indicates that Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers for the purpose of perfecting the saints
The many gifted persons in verse 11 have only one ministry, that of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church
Whatever the gifted persons in verse 11 do as the work of ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ
Christ has traveled from the heavens to the earth, from the earth to Hades, from Hades back to earth, and from the earth to the third heaven
How could a sinful, devilish persecutor of the church such as Saul of Tarsus become a gift to the Body of Christ?
If we had Ephesians 4 without Psalm 68, we probably would not realize that when Christ ascended to the heavens He led a train of captives
By His universal traveling Christ not only gathered up many sinners, but He also defeated Satan, the one who had captured them
Although we have never seen the Lord Jesus, we have no choice but to believe in Him because we have been captured by Him
By means of these steps we, the sinners, have become apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Because of Christ's universal traveling, we are no longer sinners, but sons of God, trophies to the Father, and gifts to the Body
In 1:17-18 Paul prayed that we would have a spirit of wisdom and revelation to 'know what is the hope of His calling'
The book of Acts and the Epistles reveal that the church is built up not by the Lord directly, but through the members of the Body
Ephesians 3:2 speaks of the stewardship of the grace of God, and 4:12, of the building up of the Body of Christ
The portion of Ephesians from 32 to 412 begins with the stewardship of the grace of God and ends with the building up of the Body of Christ
According to 4:12, the building up of the Body is not the work of the apostles alone; it is the responsibility of all the saints
The perfecting of the saints results in the work of ministry, which in turn results in the building up of the Body of Christ
The Body is not built up directly by the apostles and the other leading ones; it is built up directly by the saints
In order for this to take place in a practical way, all the saints need to be perfected by the apostles and the other leading ones
In his Epistles he uttered some great prophecies, such as those found in 1 Corinthians 15 and in 1 and 2 Thessalonians
His burden and intention in chapters three and four was to point out that every saint should be the same as he was in these respects
Just as we have functioned as apostles, so we have also been prophets, perhaps to our parents, relatives, and friends
As prophets, we speak on behalf of the Lord, telling others how the Lord loves them and desires to be life and everything to them
We should not have a false humility and say that we are too small, too insignificant, to be apostles and prophets
It is a fact that we can be sent out by the Lord, at least to our relatives and friends, and that we can speak for Him
We are of the same category as Paul, although, as apostles, we do not have, of course, as great a measure as he had
Ephesians 3:2 says that grace has been given to Paul, and 4:7 says that grace has been given to each one of us
As to the person of Paul, he was the least among the apostles ; but as to his ministry, he was not behind the chiefest apostles
All the members of the Body of Christ can have the same grace of life as Paul, but their gifts are not the same as Paul's gift was
If grace could be given to Paul, who thought of himself as less than the least of all saints, then it can certainly be given to all of us
Since one who was less than the least of all saints could be such a person as described in chapters three and four, then we have no excuse
Our mind needs to be purged from the natural concept that uplifts the apostles above the ordinary believers in Christ
Certainly we all can be such sent ones, and, having been sent, we all can speak for God as His prophets, His spokesmen
Do you think that the mystery has been made known only to the Apostle Paul and not been made known to all the other New Testament believers?
In the years the Lord's recovery has been in this country, the saints have seen more and more of the mystery of Christ
By receiving this revelation, we are constituted apostles and prophets, and we are qualified to speak concerning Christ and the church
As prophets, we need to speak to those around us, regardless of whether we think that they understand what we are saying
We also should contact our parents and relatives and tell them what we have seen regarding God's eternal purpose
What an impact there will be if all the saints in the Lord's recovery open their mouths and speak concerning Christ and the church!
By such an inward operating power of life, the gift of grace was given to the apostle; that is, it was manifested in him
The word 'dispensation' here refers to the process of dispensing Christ as life, as the life supply, and as everything to the believers
All the verses from 3:2 through 3:21 are a parenthesis, and Darby places them within parentheses in his translation
He continued in 4:1, 'I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called'
In chapter three Paul did not speak on the basis of being an apostle called by God but he spoke on the basis of being a prisoner of the Lord
The concept in Ephesians 3 is that not only the apostles are stewards and servants, but that all the believers are stewards and servants
Because of the influence of their religious background and environment, not many Christians regard themselves as stewards
We are all stewards; even we could be called waiters, those imparting Christ's riches to others as nourishing food
Because our stewardship is the stewardship of the grace of God, we need to receive grace, even the abundance of grace
We all can be God's sent ones and God's spokesmen, but in order to fulfill such a function, we must have grace
When the Word gets into us and the Spirit fills our spirit, spontaneously our daily walk becomes worthy of God's calling
Those who are in darkness have nothing to say, but those who are in the light have a great deal to speak forth
One who gets into the Word daily and who prays consistently will have a burden to speak to others about what he has seen and experienced
After we receive light and revelation in answer to questions such as these, we shall have a great deal to share with others
We in the Lord's recovery must be speaking people, those who speak day by day because we have received revelation
If they argue with you in a negative way, simply continue to speak positively to them about what you have seen in the book of Ephesians
If we would reach the standard established by the Apostle Paul, our whole being needs to be strengthened into the inner man
He was rooted and grounded in love and knew the dimensions of Christ and the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ
Paul prayed that we would be strengthened into the inner man so that, ultimately, we might be filled unto all the fullness of God
In verses 2 through 9 he expressed this from one angle, and in verses 16 through 19 he related it from another
From one angle, we are stewards, we have received grace, we have seen the revelation of the mystery, and we are ministers of the high gospel
If we are the same as he was, we shall be walking worthily of God's calling, for we shall be up to the standard for a believer
He was one who had received grace, who was a steward, who had seen the revelation, and who had become a minister of the high gospel
In 4:12 Paul speaks of the 'perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
Just as our blood supplies the members of our body according to their size, grace also is given to each member according to its size
Just as blood is the life supply to our physical body, so grace is the life supply to the members in the Body of Christ
Verse 11 says, 'And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers'
According to grammar, the phrase 'unto the building up of the Body of Christ' is in apposition to the phrase 'unto the work of ministry'
The building up of the Body is not only the work of the apostles and the other gifted ones, but also the work of all the saints
Both the leading apostles and prophets and all the believers, including even the smallest member, work together to build up the Body
Ignatius, one of the great church fathers, a good teacher and a pious man, made the mistake of saying that bishops are higher than elders
As the hierarchy developed, there were not only bishops, but also archbishops, cardinals, and, at the top, the pope
In Matthew 23:8-10 the Lord Jesus said, 'But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers
If you study the New Testament carefully, you will not find very much difference between the twelve apostles and all the other disciples
The grace in the New Testament is not given uniquely to the twelve apostles, but generally to all the disciples
The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was poured out upon all the disciples, not just upon the apostles
If we are enlightened by the revelation in the New Testament, we shall see that the whole New Testament age is the apostolic age
In The Assembly Life, a book published in 1934, Brother Nee said that there are no official elders, only 'unofficial' elders
Brother Nee admitted that those who do the work of apostles today do not have the holiness, the power, nor the victory of the apostles
He published the book entitled The Normal Christian Church Life, where he boldly said that there are still apostles today
When this book was published about forty years ago, we had seen only part of the light on this matter and on matters related to it
About twenty-five years ago, some brothers from the church in Manila went to a hospital to visit a certain brother who was sick
The disciples who were scattered spontaneously did the work of apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
In the church the ministry is needed to perfect the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ
We all need to see clearly that today the Lord is doing one work-to perfect all the saints until we all arrive
Once the saints have been perfected, then wherever they go, they will be apostles, the ones sent to that place
Throughout the centuries Christians have held the natural concept that the church is merely a social organization
Under the influence of the modern concept of female emancipation, they questioned why the woman had to be under the man
The fact that the nose is higher than the mouth in functional order does not mean that it is of a higher rank than the mouth
To consider the matter of rank with respect to the Body of Christ is to be under the influence of the fallen human concept
As we consider the apostles, prophets, and elders spoken of in the New Testament, we need to drop the natural concept
If we hold to our natural concept, we shall automatically think that the apostles, prophets, and elders have a higher rank
Some of the elders have been rather proud of their position and have expected the saints to give place to them
Ephesians 4:11 says, 'And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers'
The difference between him and most of us is that Paul was a building member, whereas most of us are just builded members
Such a one can never do what the apostles and prophets were able to do, because he has been neither fed nor trained
We need to rise up and declare that we want to grow in life and that we want to develop the necessary skills to become building members
If we would grow, we need to get into the Word, feed on the Word, and exercise our spirit to pray and to receive the Lord each day
By feeding on the Word and by receiving the Lord, we shall receive the nourishment required for the growth in life
If we are faithful to the Lord in this matter of training, after a few years all the saints will be useful in His hand
We need to be genuine preachers of the high and rich gospel and also those who truly know how to shepherd the new ones
The only thing remaining is that we make a definite decision before Him, even a vow, that we do not want to be left behind
On the other hand, the saints must make a definite decision with the Lord regarding their willingness to be trained to be building members
He may have done this to impress the Corinthians with the fact that in the church there should be no concept of rank
He mentioned this with the intention of helping the saints to realize that they all are to be stewards of God's grace
In 1 Peter 5:3 Peter encouraged the elders not to lord it over the church as if the church were their private possession
They kept the church in their 'pocket' as their possession and conducted themselves as if they were the 'boss'
In the very same verse Peter goes on to say, 'Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility'
For the younger to submit to the elder is somewhat difficult, but for the elder to submit to the younger is even more difficult
Do not regard yourselves as higher than others, and do not lord it over the church as if the church were your possession
When the saints see such examples established for them by the leading ones, they may say, 'Lord, thank You for these good examples
We desire to follow them in praying, in reading the Word, in preaching and teaching, and in shepherding the saints'
In order for the church to go on in a proper way, there is the need for some brothers to take care of the administrative affairs
In the church life which is the kingdom of God in a practical way today we have one King the Lord Jesus Christ and we all are His subjects
We have pointed out that the gifted ones in verse 11 perfect the saints to do the same things that they themselves do
In the New Testament there is a unique ministry: the dispensing of Christ into others for the building up of the Body
After the saints have been perfected, the leading ones should step aside and allow the saints to do the direct work of building
The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience
The oneness of the Spirit is the beginning, whereas the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God is the destination
We have pointed out that the faith in verse 13 does not refer to our act of believing, but refers to the object in which we believe
Afterward we became quite complicated by taking in various doctrines, teachings, and concepts, nearly all of which are divisive
Our oneness is the oneness of our unique faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God in our daily experience of Him as our life
Today many Christians who love the Lord, including a good number of pastors and ministers, have not seen the oneness of practicality
Many of these Christians say that as long as we are genuine believers in Christ and have the indwelling of the Spirit, we all can be one
To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is also a necessity for the practical oneness
To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is to arrive at the full building up of the Body of Christ
We have seen that we need to arrive at the practical oneness, at the full growth, and at the complete building up of the Body
Through this training the saints will learn how to function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
As we carry on a particular work, it will be with the consciousness that this work is for the building up of the Body
Formerly, we may have preached the gospel without realizing that gospel preaching must be for the building up of the Body
If we are clear about this, then the Lord will have a way to come back, for He will have a way to obtain the Bride He desires
It is difficult to define these items adequately because they are all related to life and life is very mysterious
In the New Testament the Lord is called the Son of God in relation to life, but in relation to His commission He is called Christ
When Peter received the revelation regarding Christ, he said that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God
We have the experiential and practical oneness, that is, the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
If we see this, we shall begin to lay aside whatever distracts us from Christ; we shall drop everything other than Christ Himself
Today, because we are still short of the experience of life, we do not have the full realization of this practical oneness
By reading verse 14 in its context we see that the most reliable test to expose any deceptive teaching is Christ and the church
Satan may even come to you with a teaching under the pretense that this teaching will help you to enjoy the church life more
The color may at first be very appealing, but after this teaching enters into you, its color becomes darker as time goes by
At the very time you feel the condition of the church is not positive, you should place your trust in the church all the more
Before you came into the Lord's recovery, you were probably concerned about certain things besides Christ and the church
No matter how good a teaching may appear to be, if it distracts us from Christ and the church, it is something of the sleight of men
We have seen that God's economy is to dispense the Triune God into us for the building up of the Body of Christ
To be carried away by the winds of teaching in the sleight of men unto a system of error is not holding to truth
To those who love the Lord Jesus and who are for today's church life, the only reality in the universe is Christ with the church
Although his particular teaching may be true, even this true teaching can distract you from Christ and the proper church life
To neglect Christ as the Head and the church as the Body and to speak about secondary matters is not handling the truth
Others may teach differently, emphasizing doctrines or opinions that distract people from Christ and the church
Rather, we should speak those things that bring us into contact with Christ and that build us up as the Body of Christ
Others may be tossed or carried about by such teachings but we must hold to the truth in love that is we must hold to Christ and the church
The word Head here in verse 14 indicates that our growth in life with Christ should be the growth of the members in the Body under the Head
The fact that we grow in Christ by holding to truth in love proves that holding to truth involves more than not telling lies
It is of great importance that Paul does not tell us to grow up into the Savior, into the Master, or into the Lord
If you do not remain in the Body, you may have a certain kind of growth, but it will not be the growth into the Head
According to my experience, the most difficult matter in which to grow up into Christ, the Head, is in our talking
Whether you are young or old, a brother or a sister, this is an area in which all of us desperately need to grow up into Christ as the Head
Both the joints of the supply and every single part with its measure are needed for the church to build itself up
As the leading ones, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers have the supply, the particular supply
It is correct to say that all the saints can do the work of the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
Do not expect that visits from those brothers who share in the ministry of the Word will cause the growth of the church in your locality
Even if the number of saints in a church is very small, perhaps only fifteen, there will still be some with the particular supply
Through the particular supply of the leading ones and through the operation in each part, the church will cause the growth of itself in love
In this message we shall consider 41721 with special attention to verses 20 and 21 which speak of learning Christ as the truth is in Jesus
The first item of a walk worthy of God's calling is to keep the oneness, and the second is to grow up into Christ the Head
The reason for this is that growth in Christ is intimately related to the keeping of the oneness; they cannot be separated
In the eyes of God and in the eyes of the Apostle Paul, whatever the people in the world think, say, and do is nothing but vanity
When the mind of fallen people is filled with vanity, their understanding is darkened regarding the things of God
After being created, man with the created human life was placed before the tree of life to receive the uncreated divine life
When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness
Through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened for us to contact the tree of life once more
The hardness of fallen man's heart is the source of the darkness in his understanding and the vanity of his mind
In his thorough diagnosis of the condition of fallen man, Paul points out that the nations have 'ceased from feeling'
Because the unbelievers refused to care for the feeling of their conscience, eventually the conscience stopped functioning
He also uses the past tense in the next verse, which says, 'Since indeed you have heard Him and been taught in Him as the truth is in Jesus'
For this reason, the New Testament gives us a unique biography, the biography of the Lord Jesus, written from four directions
After the Lord Jesus set up the pattern revealed in the Gospels, He was crucified on the cross and then He entered into resurrection
The Firstborn is the pattern, and the many brothers of the Firstborn are those who are to be conformed to this pattern
To learn Christ is simply to be molded into the pattern of Christ, that is, to be conformed to the image of Christ
After Christ established the pattern He was crucified and then He entered into resurrection becoming in resurrection the lifegiving Spirit
We have pointed out that at the time we believed in Christ and were baptized in Him, God put us into Him as the pattern, the mold
According to the light of the New Testament and according to our experience, to learn Christ is to be placed into Christ by God
After a person is saved, deep within him he desires to live a life in the pattern established by the Lord Jesus
Many either ignore this desire or cultivate it in a mistaken way, thinking that by self-effort they can succeed in imitating Him
We, the believers, regenerated with Christ as our life and taught in Him, learn from Him as the truth is in Jesus
After Christ established this mold, He passed through death and resurrection, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
When we believed in Him and were baptized, God put us into Him as the mold, just as dough is placed into a mold
When we read in the Gospels of the mold formed by the Lord Jesus, that mold spontaneously influences our living
As we love the Lord, contact Him, and pray to Him, we automatically live Him according to the mold described in the Gospels
We must distinguish this kind of living from that according to the modernistic teaching regarding imitating Christ as our example
The modernists falsely teach that Christ is not God, but a man who established the highest standard for us to follow
The Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, but we walk in the reality expressed in the life of Jesus recorded in the Gospels
Verses 22 and 24 show us what we have been taught: that we have put off the old man and have put on the new man
Verse 3 says, 'Are you ignorant that as many as have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
These verses indicate that through baptism we were taught that we have put off the old man and have put on the new man
Normally, as we preach the gospel to sinners, we tell them of the life, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus
The truth here is that when we were baptized, we were taught that we have put off the old man and that we have put on the new man
We have been taught in Christ as the truth is in Jesus that we have put off the old man and put on the new man
As this process takes place, the mingled spirit enters our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind
In this corporate new man there is no Greek or Jew, no bond or free, no barbarian or Scythian, but Christ is all and in all
From this the apostle goes on to the aspects of fellow-citizens of the kingdom of God and members of the household of God
The church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God's children, nor even a Body for Christ
As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life; whereas as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person
Outwardly everything related to the new man is righteous; and inwardly everything related to the new man is holy
It was in the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created
The old man is according to the lusts of the Devil, but the new man is in the righteousness and holiness of God
The human living of Jesus was according to the truth, that is, according to God Himself, full of righteousness and holiness
In verses 22 and 24 we see that the condition for learning Christ is having put off the old man and having put on the new man
Once this condition is met, it is possible for us to live a life of truth, which is the expression of God in the shining of light
He mentions things such as anger, stealing, bitterness, wrath, clamor, evil speaking, malice, tenderheartedness, and forgiveness
Although these details are easy to see, it is more difficult to discern two important matters that Paul's speaking is based upon
When we live and speak truth , we express God as our reality, and others receive God as grace for their enjoyment
Truth is clearly mentioned, but grace is somewhat hidden, being especially implied in Paul's mention of the details related to daily living
If we would be conformed to the image of Christ, that is, if we would learn Christ, we need both the principles and the details
Even how much we laugh or cry should be determined by the principle of having put off the old man and of having put on the new man
When we are filled with grace and when Christ is everything to us, we have no need to find satisfaction in other things
Only by grace can we have a life that is according to the divine standard in all the details mentioned by Paul in these verses
We desire to have kindness, patience, endurance, gentleness, mercy, love, and various other virtues and qualities
What a difference it makes in our daily living when we are happy and satisfied through the enjoyment of God in Christ as grace!
In verse 25 Paul says, 'Wherefore, having put off the falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another'
If we have the enjoyment of Christ, then in a practical way in our daily living we shall put off every false thing
Verses 26 and 27 say, 'Be angry, and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation, neither give place to the Devil'
If we have the supply of grace, we shall be slow to anger, and we shall not remain angry very long when we do become angry
In a book of such high revelation, the apostle still touches things on a practical level, even such low things as anger and stealing
The apostle charges him who steals to labor instead of being slothful and to share what he gains with others instead of being greedy
What proceeds out of our mouth should be that which is good for the building up of the church and all the saints
In verse 30 Paul says, 'And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
A proper life according to truth and in grace will always make the Holy Spirit happy and give us the joy of the Spirit
In verse 31 Paul says, 'Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be removed from you, with all malice'
Finally, verse 32 says, 'And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as also God in Christ forgave you'
In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the New Testament grace and truth are a pair and that love and light are another pair
The Gospel of John tells how God came to us in the Son so that we may receive Him as grace and realize Him as truth
1 John reveals that after we have received God in the Son, we may come to God the Father to enjoy Him as love and light
There were shadows of grace and truth in the Old Testament age, but there was not the reality of grace and truth until Jesus Christ appeared
Grace is actually the sweet Person of the Lord Jesus, who is the embodiment of the fullness of God and the effulgence of the divine glory
When the Lord Jesus asked her for a drink, she was surprised that a Jew would ask a drink from a Samaritan woman
We have pointed out that in the Gospel of John God comes to us, but that in the First Epistle of John we go to God
As we go to God, we enter into the inner chamber to contact the Father through the Son under the cleansing of the blood of Jesus
In our fellowship with the Father we have love and light, but at home or in our place of employment we have grace and truth
Although we may be under pressure at work or at home, we can still live according to truth and by the supply of grace
The church life is the issue of God coming to us as grace and truth and of our going to God to meet Him as love and light
In this traffic God comes to us to be our grace and truth, and we go to God to experience Him as our love and light
Before he mentions grace here, Paul presents the principle, the pattern, the standard; that is, he presents the truth
We all have been baptized not into grace, but into the mold, into the pattern, which is the life of truth in Jesus
We have been placed by God through baptism into the pattern, the standard, the principle, set up by the living of the Lord Jesus on earth
In all things we need grace to live a life according to the truth that is in Jesus and to be molded into the image of Christ
If we have this supply and enjoyment, we shall be able to live according to the standard of the principle of truth
As grace and truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light are the basic elements in the apostle's exhortation in 5:1-33
After we have, in the Lord Jesus, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light
Christ gave Himself up for us both as an offering to have fellowship with God and as a sacrifice to redeem us from sin
In following His example, our walk in love should not only be something for others, but also a sweet-smelling savor to God
To give thanks to God is to speak God as truth, whereas foolish talking or coarse jesting is to speak the Devil as falsehood
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and are, in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today
The millennium will be the kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today
Today all believers are in the kingdom of God, but not all of them will have an inheritance in the coming millennial kingdom
The fornicators, the unclean persons, and those of unbridled greedy lust will have no share in the reign of Christ in the millennium
The wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience mainly because of the three evil things spoken of in verse 3
Because of the love they have for their mothers, they are not willing to do anything opposed to their mothers' feeling
Because we enjoy the love of God in such an intimate way, we do not want to do anything that displeases the Father
In our daily walk we would always take care of the Father's feeling, for we live intimately in His tender love
It is significant that in speaking of the fruit of the light Paul mentions only three things: goodness, righteousness, and truth
The reason he mentions just three things is that the fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God
Notice that here Paul speaks not of the work of the light nor of the conduct of the light, but of the fruit of the light
The Father as the goodness the Son as the righteousness and the Spirit as the truth the reality are all related to the fruit of the light
In verse 11 Paul says, 'And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even expose them'
Just as Paul commands us to walk as children of light, he also commands us not to participate in the unfruitful works of darkness
In verse 13 he says, 'But all things which are exposed are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light'
If you are being rebuked by someone, you should not try to discern whether or not the one rebuking you is pure
In verse 14 Paul says, 'Wherefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from among the dead, and Christ shall shine on you'
To be filled in spirit is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
We have pointed out that living by being filled in spirit is the fifth aspect of a walk worthy of God's calling
Following this, we learn Christ by being placed into the mold, the standard of a living according to the truth in Jesus
If we are filled inwardly unto the fullness of God, there will be no problems at home, in the church, or in the community
In this evil age , every day is an evil day, full of pernicious things which destroy, injure, and spoil our time
Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are not only for singing and psalming, but also for speaking to one another
Such speaking, singing, and psalming are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit, but also the way to be filled in spirit
According to the New Testament, psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are good not only for singing, but also for speaking
Verse 20 goes on to say, 'Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father'
We should give thanks to God the Father, not only at good times, but at all times, and not only for good things, but for all things
Being subject to one another is also the way to be filled in spirit with the Lord and also the overflow of being filled
Our subjection should be one to another, not only the younger ones to the older ones, but also the older ones to the younger ones
According to the context of the following verses, to be in the fear of Christ is to fear offending Him as the Head
When we speak, sing, psalm, and give thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are willing to submit ourselves to one another
If we are not filled, there will be no speaking, singing, psalming, or thanking God, and consequently there will be no submitting
The proper church people are those who are submissive by speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God from their inner being
In this message we come to 5:22-33, where we see the proper living in the relationship between wife and husband
Regarding the relationship between children and parents, most of the problems are caused by the children, not by the parents
The children are disobedient to their parents, but, in actual practice, the parents are obedient to their children
What we have said thus far does not deny the obvious fact in 5:22 that wives are to be subject to their husbands
Because we all are familiar with this exhortation, there is no need for us to say anything to strengthen it or to intensify it
As Christ is the Head of the church and the Savior of the Body, wives must be subject to their husbands as to the Lord
Verse 23 says, 'For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is head of the church, being Himself the Savior of the Body'
In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, 'But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives to their husbands in everything'
According to divine ordination, the subjection of the wives to their husbands should be absolute, without any choice
Verse 29 goes on to say, 'For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church'
Just as we eat for the sake of our body, so husbands need to take in something of the Lord for the sake of their wives
At such times, a husband should tenderly warm and soften his wife, just as a mother bird warms her baby birds by embracing them
The warmth conveyed through such cherishing does not burn others; it soothes them tenderly and even melts their hearts
Verse 31 says, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh'
Christ and the church being one spirit , as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, are the great mystery
A man and a woman get married for the sake of their own married life, not for the sake of their parents' family life
It is absolutely against the biblical principle for a married couple to live either with the husband's parents or with the wife's parents
The church as the new man is a matter of grace and truth, whereas the church as the Bride of Christ is a matter of love and light
In grace and truth we should live as the new man, and in love and light we should conduct ourselves as the Bride of Christ
The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, present a significant and complete picture of Christ and the church
We should regard a husband and wife not as two separate persons, but as one complete person, as two halves of a whole unit
We also need to see that we must attain to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ because we are to be Christ's counterpart
If we see this vision, we shall be able to understand the type of Christ and the church in chapter five of Ephesians
The vine absorbs the riches from the soil and the water, digests them, and then transmits them to the branches
If we would be nourished by Christ today, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and the life supply
Along with abiding in the Lord constantly, we must daily come to the Word and take it in as our life and life supply
To be nourished is to have something imparted into us inwardly, whereas to be cherished is to be warmed and comforted outwardly
In our environment or circumstances the Lord Jesus is often real to us as a warm, tender breeze blowing upon us
In the environment of the church life, we often experience the Lord's cherishing, although we may not even be conscious of it
We may have everything necessary for our material existence, but we know that something we formerly enjoyed is missing
When we return to the church life, we immediately and spontaneously enter into the environment and atmosphere of the Lord's cherishing
To be in this climate, this atmosphere, this environment, gives us rest, comfort, healing, cleansing, and encouragement
When John the Baptist was told of the many who were coming to Christ, John said, 'He who has the bride is the bridegroom'
Eventually, John the Baptist received nothing, and all the increase, the Bride, went to the Bridegroom to be His increase
If the church did not have the life and nature of Christ, the church could not be Christ's counterpart and could never be a match for Christ
Although the church has received Christ's own life and nature, there is still need for supply and for care so that there may be growth
They are related to supplying and caring for the life that has already come into existence so that this life may grow to its full measure
As the vine is nourished, it is simultaneously cherished by its environment, mainly by the fresh air and the sunshine
In this message we shall consider a third aspect concerning Christ and the church-the aspect of sanctifying by cleansing
In these verses Paul is saying that husbands should love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her
Christ's purpose in loving the church and in giving Himself up for the church was to sanctify her by the washing of the water in the Word
The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence
In Ephesians 5:25 we have the church coming into existence through Christ's loving her and giving Himself up for her
After Eve had been prepared for Adam by being built out of Adam's rib, she was presented to Adam, the source from which she came
Most of us have been separated from the world unto God through the help we have received in the church meetings
The more we are cherished by the atmosphere in the meetings, the more we are willing to give up the things of the world
Eventually, the Bride will be complete, perfect, and grown to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
In verse 26 Paul says that Christ sanctifies the church by cleansing her through the washing of the water in the Word
In sanctifying the church, the Lord firstly washes away our sins with His blood and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life
Day by day, morning and evening, we need to come to the Bible and be cleansed by the laver of water in the Word
By coming to the Word in this way, we are cleansed from the defilement we have accumulated in our contact with the world
Whenever you contact the world in the course of your human living, you need to come to the Word to be cleansed
All the spots and wrinkles in the church will be washed away through the inner cleansing of the water in the Word
To be holy is to be separated to the Lord from common things and then saturated and permeated with the divine nature, with all that God is
If we would be pure, we must be without mixture; that is, we must not have anything other than God in our being
The church will be the expression of God Himself mingled with a resurrected, uplifted, and transformed humanity
Finally, a third stage of Christ is revealed in verse 27, which speaks of Christ presenting the church to Himself in His coming back
The first of these three stages was in the past, the second is in the present, and the third will be in the future
In the first stage Christ was the Redeemer; in the second, He is the life-giving Spirit; and in the third, He will be the Bridegroom
After the Lord Jesus gave Himself for us in the flesh, He was resurrected and in resurrection became the life-giving Spirit
If day by day there is no speaking of the Lord within us, it is an indication that there is some problem within us
If there is no speaking, no rhema, then in our practical experience the Spirit is absent, for the Lord's speaking actually is the Spirit
By the metabolic cleansing that comes from the speaking of Christ as the life-giving Spirit, we are truly changed, transformed
Because such an inward transformation is taking place within us, there is no need for outward correction in the church life
In this way we are purified and sanctified; in this way we also experience the practicality of the church life
The elders and the elderly sisters need to help the saints to realize that their need is to take the Lord Jesus as their person
The more all the saints do this, the more they will experience the speaking of Christ as the life-giving Spirit
Out of failure and disappointment many have come to believe that it simply is not possible to have the proper church life today
We have the church life not by trying to carry out teachings in an outward way, but by taking Christ as our life and as our person
Through the Lord's speaking within us as the life-giving Spirit, we are becoming a glorious church, a church holy and without blemish
In this way we shall undergo a metabolic change leading to the transformation in life which is necessary for the church life
God's economy is not a religion, but a wonderful, unlimited, immeasurable, unsearchable, and all-inclusive Person, Christ Jesus Himself
God's economy is not a matter of religion with doctrines and teachings; it is a matter of a wonderful, living Person
Our need today is not to be concerned with doctrine, but to be concerned with contacting the living Christ within us
We need to be recovered not merely to the objective Christ in the heavens, but to the subjective Christ in our spirit
Paul did not speak of the life of Christ, the work of Christ, or the power of Christ; he spoke of Christ Himself living in him
As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is washing us, sanctifying us, cleansing us, nourishing us, and cherishing us
In order to know the true meaning of sanctification, we need to contact the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit
Day by day, our need is to take more of Christ as the heavenly tea into us so that more of His element may be added into our being
Could we be sanctified dispositionally simply by trying to follow in an outward way the teachings of the Bible?
We have pointed out that when we take Christ as our person, we experience Him speaking in us as the life-giving Spirit
If we tell the Lord that we are not able to obey Him, He will reply, 'I am not concerned whether or not you feel you are able to obey Me
In sanctification a new element is added into us, whereas in cleansing a particular element is removed from us
In the past many of us attended so-called Christian services or read the Bible without receiving any nourishment
Our desire is to help others come in touch with the living Christ, to open to Him, and to take Him as their life and person
If your husband or wife troubles you and you are tempted to exchange words, that is the time to take Christ as your person
Many can testify that through their contact with the church in the Lord's recovery, they have been warmed and softened
Just as a mother cherishes a child by holding the child to her breast, so the Lord cherishes us by holding us close to Him
May we all take Christ as our person and experience more of His sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing
In the second stage, He as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing the church
My concept was that at His coming back from the heavens to the earth, He would suddenly take up the church and present her to Himself
According to this concept, Christ is far away in the heavens, and we on earth are making ourselves ready to be presented to Him
If we do not take Christ as our life and our person, we shall have no way to enjoy the glory that is within us
When you take Christ as your life and your person, do not expect the heavens to open and a great light to shine upon you in an outward way
When God glorifies us, He will not need to send the glory from above; rather, He will cause Christ to shine forth from within us
We may use the metamorphosis of an ugly caterpillar into a beautiful butterfly as an illustration of glorification
A caterpillar is not instantaneously transformed into a butterfly by a beauty that suddenly descends upon it and envelops it
As the law of this life functions within the caterpillar, the caterpillar is gradually transformed into a butterfly
He will expand within us and saturate us with Himself until we have been wholly swallowed up by the inner glory
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the temple with all its rituals, practices, and ordinances was still in Jerusalem
With the priests in the temple we see the practice of religion, but with the Lord in Bethany we see God's economy
Those who worshipped in the temple were practicing their religion, but Lazarus, Martha, and Mary enjoyed the presence of the Lord Jesus
The reason for this is that we realize that we have not given the Lord the full opportunity to saturate us and to come out through us
Christ's intention is not to obtain a church that is nice, right, or good, but to obtain a church that is altogether glorious
Our Christ must not be a Christ in teaching, but be a Christ making His home in our heart, a Christ saturating our being with His element
When we have been consumed by Christ in a full way, He will then present the church to Himself as a glorious church
If the church is to become glorious, we need to allow the indwelling Christ to consume every part of our inward being
When Christ has finished consuming us inwardly, He will be able to boast to Satan, 'Satan, look at My glorious church'!
Because the enemy has veiled these matters, not many Christians have a clear understanding of their significance
In the eyes of God, it does not matter whether we are good or bad, for the only thing of value in His economy is Christ Himself
Sanctification in 5:26 does not mean merely to be separated from what is common, but it means to have the very element of Christ added to us
The Lord does not want our self-improvement or self-adjustment; He wants to saturate our whole being with Himself
Under the influence of the religious concept, they regard the Bible as a book of doctrines and ethical teachings
In doing this, she is actually living like a follower of Confucius, all the while believing that she is being a good Christian
She explains her behavior by saying that, according to the Bible, her husband is the head and she is obligated to submit to him
Such a word sounds very good, but it is religious, for it is not according to God's economy to work Christ into us
Often in Christian weddings a pastor will charge the bride and groom according to Paul's word in Ephesians 5 regarding husbands and wives
Neither the bride nor the groom realizes that submission and love are the issue of being filled in our spirit with the Triune God
Spontaneously the wives will submit to their husbands the husbands will love their wives and the children will be obedient to their parents
In order to be sanctified in a genuine way, we simply need to contact the Lord and take Him as our life and our person
Subjective sanctification does not take place by teaching, but takes place by the inward working of the living Christ
Character, a combination of disposition, custom, and habit, is partly inward and partly outward, whereas behavior is wholly outward
If the Apostle Paul were with us, it would be difficult to discern his disposition, because he has been so deeply cleansed and purified
On the one hand, we have the addition of Christ, but, on the other hand, we have the subtraction of the natural disposition
When Christ was in the first of these stages, the stage of the flesh, He went to the cross and there gave Himself up for the church
Regarding himself as the most loathsome person on earth, he was desperate to know what to do about his situation
If the Lord does the sanctifying and the cleansing, He will supply the nourishment, and you will enjoy sweet satisfaction
If you want the sanctifying, the cleansing, the nourishing, and the cherishing, you must place all your trust in the living Christ
When God filled the tabernacle and the temple, both of them were filled with glory, with the very manifestation of God
The only way God can have a glorious church is through Christ's sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing
They may be spiritual, heavenly, and victorious, but they are not glorious, for they do not bear the glory of God
If we see God's economy, we shall reject such an influence and desire to become filled with glory in order that God may reach His goal
If the meeting hall were filled with angels, we would probably think that the situation of the church is glorious
Gabriel could announce the birth of Christ, but he does not have the privilege of taking Christ as his life and person
Verse 27 of Ephesians 5 has been in the New Testament for centuries, but it has been lost as far as the experience of believers is concerned
As we concentrate on the Lord's shining within, we shall spontaneously be victorious without any conscious effort on our part
If our Christ is only a Christ objectively in the heavens, we shall not have the shining of His face within us
We are not being transformed from behavior to behavior, from spirituality to spirituality, nor from victory to victory
Christ is sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing us in order to present to Himself a glorious church
Today we also are participating in the process through which Christ is presenting the glorious church to Himself
Since the day we first called upon the Lord Jesus and received Him into us, He has been seeking opportunities to work Himself into our being
After Moses had spent forty days in the Lord's presence on the mountain, the skin of his face shone with God's glory
In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul tells us that we all, with an unveiled face, need to behold and reflect as mirrors the glory of the Lord
Although many are sincerely seeking the Lord, they have been completely veiled by religion with its teachings and concepts
Over the years Christians have been divided by various ordinances and are still being divided by ordinances today
Prior to 1966 we did not have pray-reading, and before 1968 we did not have the practice of calling on the name of the Lord
God's economy is so simple: it is just to work Christ into us so that He may live in us and we may live by Him
When some hear of this, they may argue that the New Testament teaches that Christ will descend from the heavens
A number of verses tell us that the Lord is in the heavens and that in His coming He will descend from the heavens
As such an indwelling One, He is spreading within us and saturating us with Himself, seeking the opportunity to come out through us
The Bible also reveals that Christ is on the throne in the third heaven and that in His coming back He will descend to the earth
As long as people take the proper food into them, we should not be concerned whether they use chopsticks, a knife and fork, or their fingers
In so many religious groups everything is well-mannered and in excellent order, but there is no food for the Lord's people to eat
May we all see that in His economy God cares not for forms or practices, but only for His dear Son, the Lord Jesus Christ
In this message we shall present a summary of Paul's exhortation in chapter five, concentrating on love and light
Love is the inner substance of God that can be sensed, and light is the expressed element of God that can be seen
Just as Paul's exhortation in chapter four is related to the new man, so his exhortation in chapter five is related to the Bride
In giving us the long exhortation recorded in chapter four, Paul never loses sight of his main point-the church
As the new man, the church should live a life according to God's standard, according to the truth as it is in Jesus
The main point is not Paul's exhortation regarding wives submitting to their own husbands or husbands loving their own wives
The fact that the church as the Bride requires a living in love and in light can be proved by our own experience in married life
If a husband and wife live together merely by grace and according to truth, their married life will be very poor
How pitiful it would be if a husband and wife were always considering the right way to behave toward each other
To ask such questions with respect to husband or wife is to descend from the realm of light to the realm of truth
As those in the light, we shall not try to discern whether or not it is right to lose our temper at that particular time
Having entered into this realm, they were to go on to contact the Father and enter into the presence of God where all is light
If our married life is proper, we shall not consider whether our behavior with our spouse is according to truth or up to the standard
The major factor in chapter one is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
The major factor in chapter one is the church as the Body of Christ and the basic element is the wellspeaking of the Father Son and Spirit
Although all these aspects are covered, the major factor in chapter two is the church as the dwelling place of God
In the first part of the chapter the main concept is that of resurrection life, and in the second part the main thought is the Spirit
In chapter one the major factor is the church as the Body of Christ, and the basic element is the well-speaking of the Triune God
In chapter two the major factor is the church as the habitation of God, and the basic elements are resurrection and the Spirit
In chapter three the major factor is the church as the fullness of God, and the basic element is the unsearchable riches of Christ
Finally, in chapter six the major factor is the church as the warrior, and the basic elements are might and the armor
Because the church life as the Bride in love and light requires something fine and intimate, Paul uses married life as an illustration
According to Revelation 19, the warrior who fights with Christ in the battle against the enemy is firstly the Bride of Christ
Firstly we must be the Bride in love and in light, and then we can go forth as the warrior with Christ to war against the enemy
Through the sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing Christ will gain a glorious church as His Bride
By the sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing the church is being saturated with the essence of God
As such a holy church, she must be first separated from everything common and then permeated and saturated with the element of God
In order that Christ may gain such a church, we are presently undergoing His sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing
For the fulfillment of His purpose, God needs the universal new man, the church as the full-grown man in chapter four
As we have seen, what is required for the church to be the Bride is not just truth and grace, but light and love
In exhorting the children and the parents, the apostle deals with the children first, since trouble comes mostly from them
The promise, mentioned in verse 3, is that it may be well with the children and that they may live long on the earth
The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessing; it also refers to living in a peaceful situation
According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God's blessings in this life to those who honor their parents
Of provoking the children to anger, the fathers are to nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord
Raising children requires that the parents give them the needed instruction related to human life, family life, and social life
Paul was probably referring to the Old Testament requirement that parents instruct their children with the word of God
Just as the Lord Jesus sanctified Himself for the sake of His disciples so parents should sanctify themselves for the sake of their children
It is the parents' responsibility to set up a high standard and a proper pattern and example for their children to follow
Day by day we should tell Him, 'Lord, these children are not mine; they are Your possession placed in my custody for a period of time
These parents may not be happy to see the children of other families becoming more spiritual than their children
If she would stop praying so much for her child and begin to pray for the children of others, she would see His faithfulness
Not to pray for our children is wrong, but to be fully occupied with prayer for them in a selfish way is also wrong
Verse 5 says, 'The slaves, obey your masters according to flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ'
In verse 6 Paul goes on to say, 'Not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul'
Just as a person's body is his stature and expression, so the church as the Body of Christ is the stature and expression of Christ
In 2:10 Paul indicates that the church is God's poem, His masterpiece, a poetic writing that expresses the desire of the writer's heart
The fullness of God refers mainly to the source, and the fullness of the One who fills all in all refers mainly to the outcome
Of the twelve aspects of the church covered in Ephesians, the main aspects are the new man, the Bride, and the warrior
The first ten aspects of the church are all included in the new man who fulfills God's eternal purpose and carries out His economy
Although God's plan is fulfilled with the new man, Christ's desire still needs to be satisfied, and God's enemy still must be defeated
The passage from 1:1 to 6:9 completes the revelation on the positive side concerning the church for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose
In the first five chapters the church is portrayed in many ways, on the positive side, to fulfill God's eternal purpose
Brother Nee pointed out that in the universe there are three wills: the divine will, the satanic will, and the human will
If we would know how the church can be God's warrior to engage in spiritual warfare, we must know these three wills, these three intentions
One of these angels, an archangel, was appointed by God to rule the universe that existed before the creation of Adam
In addition to God's intention, God's will, there is a second intention, a second will, for now the satanic will is set against God's will
That rebellion was the beginning of all the fighting that is now taking place among nations, in society, in the family, and in individuals
All the different kinds of warfare have their source in the controversy between the divine will and the satanic will
When sinners repent for the kingdom of God they turn from the side of Satan to the side of God which is the kingdom of God the will of God
After a person turns from the satanic will to the divine will, he must believe in the Lord Jesus and be baptized
Through baptism he is brought out of the authority of darkness the satanic will and is transferred into the kingdom of the Son of Gods love
The Israelites proceeded to fight their way through the wilderness, and they continued fighting in the good land
Not only must God's eternal purpose be fulfilled and the desire of Christ's heart be satisfied, but God's enemy must be defeated
According to my experience, most of those who were saved through my gospel preaching were those with a strong will and a definite intention
For the new man, we need to be renewed; for the Bride, we need to be submissive; and for the warrior, we need to be empowered
We are empowered by the power that raised Christ from among the dead and made Him to be the Head over all things
In chapter two we sit with Christ in the heavenlies , and in chapters four and five we walk in His Body on the earth
Because of the working of Satan, who is the authority of darkness, the earth and its atmosphere have become 'this darkness'
Along with these three items, we need to take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit
In order for us to stand, our daily living must be according to the principle of the truth and up to the standard of the truth
Because Paul's daily living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to face all opposition and adverse circumstances
No matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness
If we are to engage in spiritual warfare, we must have a conscience void of offense, a conscience without holes
He does not trouble us so much in this way at other times, Satan knows when there are offenses on our conscience
Whenever we intend to fight against the powers of darkness, Satan, through his accusations, causes our conscience to become very sensitive
Many readers of Ephesians think that in verse 15 Paul is charging us to be always ready and prepared to put on the shoes of the gospel
In the past most of us thought that the shoes of the gospel were for us to walk or to run in our preaching of the gospel
Because there are those who have their feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, they can withstand any attack of the enemy
Christ is God expressed and revealed, Christ is the righteous element that covers us, and Christ is the peace that enables us to stand
In the foregoing message we considered the first three items of the armor of God: the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes
The girdle is related to truth, the breastplate is related to righteousness, and the shoes are related to peace
When we live out God in our daily living, we are covered with Christ as our righteousness, and we have peace as our firm foundation
If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we shall spontaneously have faith
No matter what may happen to us or what kind of sufferings we may undergo, we must always believe in the goodness of God's heart
We all need to have a full faith in God in Gods heart in Gods faithfulness in Gods ability in Gods word in Gods will and in Gods sovereignty
Flaming darts were used by warriors in the apostle's time, and the apostle used this as an illustration of Satan's attacks on us
In order to have the faith to be defended against Satan's flaming darts, we need a proper spirit with a conscience void of offense
Rather, we must firstly put on the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes, and then take up the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation
In other words, according to this understanding, the sword is the word, and the One who uses the sword to slay the enemy is the Spirit
When we have the whole armor of God, including the sword, we are not only protected, but also prepared to wrestle against the enemy
When we are equipped with such a full armor, we can stand against the attack of the enemy and even take the offensive against him
The modifier 'by means of all prayer and petition' in verse 18 is related to all six items of the armor covered in verses 14 through 17
It is by prayer that we take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God
Paul's charge to pray in spirit implies that we must also pray in the Spirit of God, for these two spirits are mingled in us
For the sake of a proper prayer life, our mind must be sober, our emotion must be regulated, and our will must be strengthened
In verse 18 Paul goes on to speak of 'watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints'
To watch unto prayer implies that we exercise our will, calm our mind, and regulate our emotion in order to pray properly
We need to be those who exercise ourselves to such a degree that as soon as we have finished a long conversation we are able to pray
If you have set aside a certain time in the morning for prayer, then you need to persistently watch regarding this time
We should pray particularly for our watching unto prayer, that is, pray for our prayer life, for our prayer time
Consider how much time is required to pray for the saints in your locality and for the saints in other cities and countries
In our gospel meetings we must do more than sing and tell others that Christ can meet their need for satisfaction
Pray that the Lord will give us utterance and open our mouths with boldness to teach and to preach the mystery of the gospel
Although Paul was chained to the one who guarded him, he nevertheless desired to speak boldly, as he ought to speak
In the Lord's recovery today, such a loving concern between the apostles and the churches needs to be restored
We need this concern, not to carry out a commission or do a work, but to have the necessary and proper fellowship
Today there also is the need for messengers to visit the churches to relay information and to encourage the saints
It was such an effort to go just that distance that many people spent their whole lives in that village without ever going to Chefoo
In addition to the highways, the airlines with so many cross-country flights have increased the prosperity of this nation
Verses 23 and 24 are Paul's blessing: 'Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
In the opening of the book, the apostle's greeting is with grace first as the enjoyment and then peace as the result of the enjoyment
The reason for this insertion is that the only way we can be kept in a situation of peace is by continually enjoying the Lord in love
By means of the breastplate, our faith and love, which are necessary for a proper Christian life, are preserved
Whenever we take part in spiritual warfare, our conscience must be protected from Satan's accusation by the breastplate of righteousness
The verses concerning faith and love in the Gospel of John, 1 Thessalonians, and 1 Timothy indicate that faith and love go together
Grace is needed for us to live a church life that fulfills God's eternal purpose and solves God's problem with His enemy
For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruption, that is, in a condition which is incorruptible
Creation salvation sanctification spirituality and victory are all part of Gods procedure to reach His goal but they are not the goal itself
In order to share in the recovery of the proper church life, we need to see what God's purpose was in the beginning
To go back to the beginning is to go back to the beginning in eternity to the beginning in Gods creation or to the beginning of the church
The book of Ephesians reveals that the church came into existence according to the eternal purpose which God purposed in Christ
The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past
In 1:9 Paul says, 'Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself'
In other words, all things are for us, and we are for God in order that He may fulfill His desire to have the church
The church is an entity constituted not just of the divine life or merely of the human life, but of the divine-human life
We thank the Lord that although this has been hidden from the saints for centuries, He has revealed it to us in His recovery
It is vital to see that the church is a hybrid produced by the mingling of the divine life with the human life
The divine life is not only interwoven with the human life, but the divine life and the human life are mingled to form one entity
Just as the members of our body are for the body, not for the members themselves, so we have become Christians fort he church
In Galatians 3:27 and 28 Paul says that as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and that we are all one in Christ Jesus
The church on the contrary is composed of the proper humanity the humanity created by God and uplifted by Christ mingled with the Triune God
Ephesians 3:9 speaks of the 'dispensation of the mystery, which from the ages has been hidden in God, Who created all things'
God's intention in His creation of all things, including man, was that man would be mingled with God to produce the church
Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
In 1:17, Paul prays that the Father of glory would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him
What is needed for the church life is not a mind that is naturally keen, but a spirit of wisdom and revelation
In 2:22 Paul speaks of the human spirit again: 'In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
In 3:5 Paul points out that the mystery of Christ 'has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit'
In 5:18 Paul gives the exhortation, 'And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit'
The reason there is virtually no church life in Christianity today is that most Christians do not know the human spirit
We have the Spirit strengthening us and Christ making His home in us; then we are filled unto the fullness of God
In Ephesians we have not only the doctrine of the Trinity, but the practicality of the Trinity for the dispensing of God into man
Christ the Son of God and the very embodiment of God is the lifegiving Spirit indwelling our spirit to spread into all of our inward parts
The result of this is not only holiness spirituality and victory but the marvelous mingling of divinity with humanity to produce the church
Through this process there is brought into being a hybrid life, an entity composed of the mingling of the divine life with the human life
When we do this, the life-giving Spirit comes into our spirit, and the mingling of the divine life and the human life takes place within us
For the sake of the church, the fullness of God is embodied in Christ that the riches of Christ may be made real to us through the Spirit
In 2:18 all Three of the Triune God are mentioned: 'For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father'
The processed God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is waiting for our spirit to respond to Him and to cooperate with Him
We become holy not by learning the doctrine of holiness, but by contacting the Spirit who Himself is the essence of holiness
In the book of Ephesians there is great emphasis on the mingled spirit, the human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit
In 2:22 Paul again refers to the mingled spirit: 'In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
In 3:5 Paul says that the mystery of Christ 'has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit'
When our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit, our spirit becomes the organ in which the mystery of Christ is revealed
If Satan would tell God that He has no right to be near sinful people, the blood of Jesus Christ would immediately testify against him
The effectiveness of Christ's redemptive death, typified by the offerings in the Old Testament, is now in the life-giving Spirit
Because the church is produced by the mingling of divinity with humanity, we may say that the church is a hybrid
Those who have been Christians for years know that on the cross Christ died as the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world
Christians do not see this point because they concentrate on personal salvation sanctification or victory and pay no attention to the church
Even many Bible teachers fail to point out that in Ephesians Christ abolished the ordinances in order that the church might be produced
The cross abolished the ordinances in order to give place to the Spirit in whom we have access unto the Father
Do not be concerned about the arrangement of the chairs or about whether or not the sisters wear a head covering
If some sisters make an ordinance out of head coverings, they will be divided from the sisters who do not wear a head covering
If all the sisters are in the Spirit, not caring for ordinances about head covering, they will be built up together
A number of times we have held different opinions, but by the Lord's mercy we have been willing to drop them for the sake of the oneness
When we hold on to our doctrinal opinion, we are through with the reality of Christ, which is nothing less than the life-giving Spirit
Since we emphasize the need to set aside doctrine for the building up of the church, you may wonder what we do with the Bible
When we contact the Word, we should exercise not only our mind but especially our spirit to take in the Word as nourishment
If we are faithful to care for the reality of Christ and not for doctrines or ordinances, we shall not be divided
When we say that we are for the living Spirit and not for doctrine, this does not mean that we do not believe in the Bible
In the same principle, if certain brothers and sisters feel that they are old and desire to be buried, we are willing to accommodate them
Ordinances are a wall that separates, whereas doctrine is a wind that carries people away from the building up of the Body
We know that through the past several centuries God's people have been divided and even denominated by doctrine and ordinances
In verse 13 Paul is not saying that we are brought near to God; he is saying that we are brought near to one another
Christ, our peace, has made the Jews and the Gentiles one, having broken down the middle wall of partition that separated them
In His flesh He abolished the enmity, the law of commandments in ordinances, in order to create the two in Himself into one new man
In verse 16 Paul goes on to say, 'And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it'
Verse 17 continues, 'And coming, He preached the gospel of peace to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near'
On the day we heard the gospel, Christ came as the Spirit to preach to us the good news of the peace which He had accomplished on the cross
All these verses indicate that the abolishing of the ordinances for the producing of the church is part of the gospel
Although we have been saved and regenerated to become children of God, our daily life is meaningless without the church
In Ephesians 3:8 Paul said that grace had been given to him 'to preach to the nations the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel'
We praise the Lord for showing us that, according to the book of Ephesians, the gospel includes the creation of the new man
The former manner of life includes everything related to us: what we are, what we have, our family life, and our social life
In addition, if we continue to live according to the old man, the church life will be seriously damaged, even terminated
To keep the Word in a living way is one thing, but to turn the revelations in the Word into doctrine is another
For the church life, we must have no ordinances, we must not be occupied with doctrine, and we must not have any oldness
My desire is to be like Paul, to be one who has given up the old man and who has become flexible in dealing with people
The new man is the practical church life, which is Christ as the life-giving Spirit mingled with our spirit in a corporate way
To put on the church life as the new man is to put on this entity produced by the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit
Often they have the sense in their spirit to speak or to call on the name of the Lord, but they refuse to do so
The blood deals with sin and uncleanness, whereas the water in the Word deals with wrinkles and spots, with oldness and hurts
If we do this, the Word will not only be food to nourish us, but also water to wash us and to cleanse us from all oldness and wounds
The only way to remove the spots caused by this mutual wounding is to experience the washing of the water in the Word
The entire book of Ephesians reveals in a consistent way that the church is the mingling of the divine Spirit with the human spirit
It is by this process that the Lord Jesus will fulfill the prophecy He uttered in Matthew 16:18: 'I will build My church'
In this message we shall consider more than thirty points related to God's accomplished work concerning the church
The fact that we were chosen in eternity means that our salvation began before the foundation of the world and before time
He has put us into the position of grace that we may be the object of His grace and favor, that we may enjoy all that God is to us
We have the Holy Spirit as the guarantee, pledge, down payment, deposit, foretaste, and sample, of our inheritance
Ephesians 2:13 says, 'But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have become near in the blood of Christ'
Now we have the deep sense that in Christ we are closer to one another than we are to our brothers and sisters in the flesh
According to 1:17 and 18, enlightenment is related to receiving a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of God
In chapter three Paul prayed that our inner man, our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Holy Spirit, would be strengthened with power
Many times it is not as helpful for an elder to say a certain thing as it is for one of the other saints to say the same thing
Some may argue that only the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers can perfect the saints
If you have the sense that you have been perfected through functioning, that is an indication that others have been perfected also
The old element, the element of Adam, is discharged, and the eternal element, the element of Christ, is added to take its place
As we are cherished by Christ, we are warmed, softened, and comforted, just as a child is soothed by the loving embrace of the mother
As we are armed with the whole armor of God, we become God's army to fight the battle for God's purpose and for His kingdom
If we would have the proper church life, we need to experience every aspect of God's work covered in this message
We need to pray concerning all these items, pray-reading the verses that speak of them, until they become our reality
The fact that God has predestinated us, or marked us out beforehand, to be His sons means that we have been predestinated to be born of Him
To be predestinated to sonship is to be predestinated to be born of God so that He may become our Father and that we may become His sons
Having become the object of God's grace, we have been favored in Christ, and we have redemption through the blood of Christ
The closing word in the first chapter of Ephesians concerns the church, which is Christ's Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
We have been predestinated, we have been sealed, and we have received a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may know the Body
If He had redeemed us and forgiven us without enlivening us, God would have had a great many redeemed ones who were still in death
We need to receive the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit
As we consider all these verses, we see that in the genuine church there is no religion, tradition, regulations, forms, or rituals
There is just the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit working in our spirit to produce the Body, the new man
We have been made alive for God's dwelling place, and we enjoy the riches of Christ that we may be part of the church
Later, however, Judaism crept in with its forms and ordinances, especially the ordinances concerning circumcision, the Sabbath, and eating
The Epistle to the Colossians was written to deal with this, just as Galatians was written to deal with religion
In the first apostolic church, the wisdom of words was no more sought after than friendship with the world which is enmity with God
Of engaging in disputes over the Person of Christ, let us receive in simplicity whatever the Scriptures reveal concerning Him
From the very beginning, when the foundation of the church life was laid in this locality, we had nothing to do with the tree of knowledge
If we are clear about the factors that have damaged and corrupted the church, we shall be kept from taking the old way of Christianity
Like Paul in Philippians 3, we count as dung everything other than Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
My burden is that we all be 'wrecked' for Christ and the church, and that we be unloaded of the old things of Christianity
In the Lord's recovery we must go all the way back to the beginning, where there was the eating of the tree of life
In the beginning there was just the Word to feed us; there was no religion, no tree of knowledge, and no organization
Because we have been unloaded and released, we can be living and aggressive for Christ and the church wherever we may go
May we all be deeply impressed that the church life has nothing to do with religion, knowledge, or organization
As long as we have the church life we have everything salvation redemption sanctification the overcoming life the rapture and the kingdom
The operation in the measure of each part causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love
No matter what the situation may be on earth, we have the assurance that the Lord is carrying on the work of His recovery
People are helped to be saved, to become religious, to pursue spirituality, and to desire a closer walk with the Lord
In his subtlety the enemy, Satan, has used various good things such as fundamental doctrine to damage the church
As we have seen, the gifted persons are for the building up of the Body, and the Body is growing unto the building up of itself in love
The church has the same life and nature as Christ and becomes one with Him to be His counterpart, as Eve became one flesh with Adam
Eventually, as Eve went back to Adam and was presented to him, so the church will go back to Christ and be presented to Him as His Bride
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today
As we are preparing for that day, we are the church in the aspects of the family, the kingdom, the dwelling place, and the warrior
We cannot be satisfied with knowledge or with the doctrine that the church is the new man with Christ as the person
Christ desires to make known His love to the church, and the church responds by telling the Lord how much she loves Him
Whoever contacts us should receive an impression that we love the Lord and, out of our love for Him, serve Him willingly
If you stay away from the church life for a period of time, you will realize how precious the church is in the aspect of God's family
Whenever the believers come together as the church in the aspect of the Body and in these other aspects, Satan trembles
It is a matter of being built up together as the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, the dwelling place, and the warrior
As we consider Gods economy as revealed in the book of Ephesians we need to pray that the Lord will give us an open heaven with a clear sky
In 1:10 Paul speaks of a dispensation, or economy, of the fullness of the times, in which all things will be headed up in Christ
The English word economy is an anglicized form of oikonomia, which means administration, stewardship, arrangement, or dispensation
Three times in chapter one Paul mentions God's will: the good pleasure of His will , the mystery of His will , and the counsel of His will
The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past
The fact that Christ and the church are one spirit , as typified by the husband and wife who are one flesh, is the great mystery
It is important that we remember these crucial terms: will, good pleasure, purpose, counsel, economy, and mystery
Since God's economy is Christ with the church, we need to consider how He carries out this economy and fulfills it
Regarding the accomplishment of God's economy, the sky over all the saints in all the local churches needs to be crystal clear
We all need to thank the Lord for His eternal selection, the selection made in eternity past for eternity future
Ephesians 1:5 says, 'Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will'
God firstly selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny
Each of the children of Israel had an individual experience of this salvation, but they were saved corporately, all at the same time
In chapter five Paul deals with sanctification, another step in the carrying out of God's economy concerning Christ with the church
John 15:1 says, 'I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman,' and in verse 5 the Lord says, 'I am the vine, you are the branches'
If we view salvation from the perspective of God's economy, we shall see the Christian life in a different way
Even if you do not make this request specifically, deep within this is your feeling as you pray about your failure
God's intention is not to improve us; it is to work the living Christ into us, into our mind, emotion, and will
There is a great difference between ethics, conduct, and behavior, on the one hand, and such a Christ wrought into our being, on the other
In Galatians 6:15 Paul says, 'For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation'
In 210 Paul says For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God before prepared that we should walk in them
Our desire should not be to become a good brother or sister; we should desire to become a 'Christ' brother or a 'Christ' sister
We need to participate in the riches of Christ and to have these riches daily, even hourly, wrought into us in a specific way
In such a case, we shall be able to testify that the person living in our heart is no longer the self, but Christ
He wants a people who are not occupied with knowledge, work, behavior, or power, but who simply care for Christ in a very practical way
The experience of the riches of Christ and the reality of Christ making His home in our hearts should not be mere doctrines
They would say Since you are a servant of the Lord and have spiritual understanding you can discern who is right and render a fair judgment
Apart from this, it does not matter very much whether husbands love their wives or wives submit to their husbands
In the book of Ephesians the matter of Christ making His home in our hearts is more strategic than love for wives or submission to husbands
In contrast to all this, the Lord's recovery is altogether a matter of Christ wrought into us and making His home in our hearts
In 4:13 Paul says that we all need to arrive 'at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ'
In 4:15 Paul goes on to say that we need to hold to truth in love so that we may grow up into Christ in all things
To grow up into Christ in all things is to have Christ increase in us in all things until we attain to a full-grown man
Many students of the Word realize that Colossians reveals Christ as the Head and Ephesians reveals the church as the Body
Not even the book of Colossians reveals Christ in such a vertical and horizontal way as He is revealed in Ephesians
Colossians says that Christ must have the preeminence, the first place, in all things, but it does not say that Christ is far above all
Christ is not only all and in all with respect to the new man, but He fills all in all with respect to the universe
Although death did everything possible to hold Him, Christ could have said, 'Death, is this all you can do to Me?
In a number of respects the Christ we enjoy in the Lord's recovery is different from the Christ in Christianity
In order for Christ to make His home in our hearts, we need to be strengthened with power through the Spirit into our inner man
The immeasurable Christ who is making home in us is the Spirit, on the one hand, and the very God of fullness, on the other hand
If we are strengthened by the Spirit and Christ makes His home in us, we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God
When He makes His home in us, the Spirit is strengthening us, and we are being filled unto the fullness of God
He is the Spirit who strengthens us, the Christ who makes His home in us, and the God who fills us unto His fullness
May we all see that the Christ whom we have received is the Spirit who strengthens and the God who fills us unto His fullness
In 4:9 and 10 Paul says, 'Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?
Many brothers and sisters have very little function in the church because they have not yet been constituted as gifts
As Christ descends and ascends within them, He captures them, vanquishes them, and constitutes them into gifts to His Body
Through Christ's descending and ascending within him, he has been constituted into a useful gift to the Lord's recovery
He is far above all, He is unsearchable and immeasurable, and yet He is intimately making His home in our hearts
He is making His home in our heart and He is imparting into us His unsearchable riches so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God
Many good messages have been given on how the cross of Christ has dealt with sin, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the Devil
The two peoples have been created in Christ with the divine essence into one new entity, the corporate new man
He did so not merely for the purpose of eliminating ordinances; He abolished the ordinances in order to create the one new man
Surely the greatest test of whether or not we take Christ as our life and as our person is related to ordinances
It is crucial for us all to see that more than nineteen hundred years ago all our ordinances were abolished by Christ on the cross
Our need today is not doctrinal knowledge, but the practical and daily experience of taking Christ as our person
At that time we pointed out that in order to have the church in the aspect of the new man, we need to take Christ as our person
May we all go to the Lord and have a thorough transaction with Him concerning all the details of our daily living
We may go on to say that if they believe in Him, they will be forgiven, justified, saved, and made ready for heaven
The important factor in the preaching of the gospel is to help people open to the Lord Jesus and take Him into them
Even if a person has no concept of forgiveness, justification, or heaven, he will have the reality of all these if he takes Christ into him
When God called us, His desire was that we focus our attention not on forgiveness or justification, but on receiving His dear Son into us
As long as Christ is living in us, we shall have no problem with forgiveness, justification, salvation, or heaven
It is a fact that Christ has abolished the ordinances in order to create the Jews and the Gentiles into one new man
One way to tell whether or not you still have ordinances is to check whether or not Christ is making His home in your heart
In this sheet were 'all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air'
Our experience testifies that whenever we refuse to go along with the Lord, we lose His presence and His anointing
Christ has come into us to be our life and our person, and He will not be satisfied until we take Him as our person in a practical way
Many married sisters are reluctant to read Ephesians 5 because it speaks about wives submitting to their own husbands
They may even blame the Lord and tell Him that if He had given them a different husband, they would surely be submissive to him
If you take Him as your person and allow Him to make His home in your heart, you will surely submit to your husband
It is altogether a matter of Christ living and making His home in our hearts, so that in all things we may grow up into Him as the Head
Eventually Christ was incarnated accomplished redemption through crucifixion was buried resurrected and then ascended to the third heaven
Many of us can testify that, before coming into the Lord's recovery, we did not know Christ adequately as the embodiment of God
Ephesians 3 says that the Spirit strengthens us into our inner man so that Christ can make His home in our hearts
Through this washing He will present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
To be holy is to be saturated and transformed with Christ, and to be without blemish is to be spotless and without wrinkle
The Christ who is the embodiment of God is the Christ who loves the church and is cleansing her by the washing of the water in the Word
According to them, we cannot have the church life in this age; they say the church life is possible only in the age to come
In spite of all opposition, we have the assurance that the church life will be recovered in full in this age, not in the age to come
Brother Nee once told us that the Lord went to China because it was virgin soil for the cultivation of the church life
The Lord knew that, primarily because of language, China was not the best place for the spread of His recovery
The United States is not the goal; it is a stepping-stone for the spread of the recovery to Europe and eventually to Jerusalem
When the Japanese army took over the Philippines during World War II, General MacArthur was forced to withdraw
No matter what Satan does to damage the church, the Lord Jesus will return, and His church will be waiting for Him
Because we also love the church, we are one with Him for the spread of His recovery throughout the world and back to Jerusalem
Because Christ is the Head over all things to the church, He is able to make gifts and to present them to the church
Because all that Christ is and has is transmitted to the church, He is able to constitute us as gifts to the Body
We have pointed out that it is through His descending and ascending that Christ constitutes us into gifts to the church
We need to praise the Lord for His traveling, for the marvelous two-way traffic between heaven and earth and between earth and heaven
The more Christ settles down in our hearts, the more He can boast to Satan that He has a home in His believers
The various functions of our personality-our mind, emotion, and will-are directly related to our heart, not to our spirit
Because all the functions of personality are concentrated in the heart, it is the place where Christ desires to make His home
Every regenerated person has Christ in his spirit, but not many have allowed Christ to spread into their hearts
It seems as if Paul wanted to tell the Ephesians, 'Because you have been saved and regenerated, you have Christ in your spirit
When you pray, you may contact the Lord in your spirit, only to leave Him and go shopping according to your own desire and choice
With the church life, the problem is not only with our taking Christ as life; it is also with our taking Christ as our person
Concerning shopping, it is not a matter of what we intend to buy; it is a matter of who is buying that particular item
If we take Christ as our person, then as we come together in the meetings Christ will be expressed from our spirit and through our heart
Whenever we testify in the meetings, others will be able to tell whether or not we have been taking Christ as our person
If we are faithful to take Christ as our person, we shall enjoy the presence of the Lord Jesus in the meetings
We need to pray for ourselves and for others to have the reality of taking Christ as our person in our daily living
The Lord will thus expand in our heart, take possession of our heart, and make His home in our heart in a full way
Eventually, He will saturate our whole being with Himself, and we shall live no longer by the self, but by Christ
The more this becomes our experience, the more the meetings of the church will be the presence of the Lord Jesus
In such meetings there is little need for preaching, teaching, or the exercise of gifts, because Christ is expressed through the saints
Because Christ is so rich available present and practical in the experience of the saints they will be able to share Christ with one another
In Ephesians 4 we see that when the victorious Christ ascended He led a train of vanquished foes and constituted them into gifts to His Body
Many Christians think only the leading apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are gifts to the church
We need to grow up into Christ in all the details of our daily living, for example, in shopping and in talking
In order to put on the church life as the expression of the one new man, we need to grow out of everything natural by growing up into Christ
If we proclaim that the church is our community life but we do not grow into Christ, we shall not be stable in the church life
If we do not show any growth in such aspects of our daily life, others may rightfully question the security of our life in the church
By growing day by day in Christ, we gradually put off the old social life and put on the church the new man as the new community life
If we do not give Christ the opportunity to make His home in us, we can neither take Him as our person nor have the genuine growth in Christ
As we take Christ as our person and grow up into Him, the church life is constituted into our being, and we become part of the church
Subconsciously or unconsciously, many think that the church should be characterized by the manifestation of spiritual gifts
We cannot agree with the claim that all Christians will become one if they have certain charismatic experiences
According to my experience and observation, those who emphasize the Pentecostal or charismatic experiences are the most divisive
In Christian meetings they may not care much for the edification of others, but care primarily for the manifestation of their own gifts
Most Christians confuse these terms, thinking that the riches of Christ are the same as the fullness of Christ
In 4:13 he says that we need to arrive 'at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ'
Christ, who is the infinite God without limitation of any kind, is so great that He fills all things in all things
For the church to have the riches of Christ and not the fullness of Christ would be an indication that Christ is limited
As the expression of the unsearchably rich Christ, the church is the unlimited expression of the unlimited Christ
God's intention is to bring us back to Christ, back from everything that has become a substitute for Him or has distracted us from Him
In the meetings we should not be concerned about the way of meeting, but with the expression of the living Christ
Others have asked us why we cannot go along with the methods of worship that have been practiced by Christians for centuries
Verse after verse in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament encourages us to call on the name of the Lord
If we are truly scriptural, we will take the Word not only by reading, studying, and searching, but also by praying
With verses such as Ephesians 6:17 and 18 before us, who can say that to pray-read the Word is not according to the Bible?
How much we need to turn from the traditional understanding and come back to Christ Himself and to the pure Word of God!
As Christians who live by Christ, whenever we come together we should follow the indwelling Spirit to express Christ
We should not come to the meeting according to our concept, for it is too much under the influence of religious tradition
Some have very little of Christ with which to function and to minister because they have little experience of Him
In the meetings of the recovered church life, the saints who live by Christ need to express Christ in a living way
Ephesians 5:18 and 19 exhort us to be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
In a very practical way the church will be filled unto all the fullness of God, with the overflow of all that God is
The church life will be not the expression of gifts, knowledge, or power, but the expression of the living Christ
In Ephesians 1 we are told that the church is the Body and that this Body is the fullness of the One who fills all in all
Although the family life of these unbelievers was good, it had nothing to do with Christ or with God's economy
It is crucial for us to see that the focal point of God's economy is not a standard of character or behavior; it is Christ with the church
During the time of the Lord Jesus on the earth and of the Apostle Paul, Satan utilized the Old Testament to veil the Jewish people
The saints still have their shortcomings and failures, but they are nonetheless undergoing the process of transformation
More than ten years ago certain ones claimed that the Lord desires to recover the vast field of Pentecostal gifts
If we experience Christ in this way, then in reality and in practicality the church will be the Body of Christ
If you lose an arm, it may be replaced by an artificial limb, but that limb will not be a genuine part of your body
The fullness of Christ, which is the Body, has a stature, for Paul speaks of the stature of the fullness of Christ
Chapter one reveals that the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ, and chapter four, that the fullness of Christ has a stature
As Christ grows within them, they will gradually increase unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
Presently we are on the way toward a full-grown man, toward the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
No matter how disciplined, regulated, or improved we may be, none of this is of the church if it does not issue out of Christ
Self-regulation, self-discipline, and self-improvement may produce an excellent society, but it cannot produce the church
No matter what kind of disposition we may have, our natural being needs to be swallowed up and even consumed by the indwelling Christ
What is important is not that we merely learn about Christ or that we imitate Christ, but that we receive of His fullness
If we daily receive of His fullness, we shall eventually become His fullness, for we shall be constituted according to what we have received
Day by day and even hour by hour we need to enjoy these marvelous, wonderful, immeasurable, unlimited, and all-inclusive riches
In 2 Corinthians 47 Paul says But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us
Through the process of transformation over a period of time, the treasure takes over the vessel and swallows it up
In 2 Corinthians there are a number of such disclosures by which we can see how Paul enjoyed particular aspects of the riches of Christ
Some of these are the fact that Christ is God, the Creator, the Son of God, the Redeemer, the Savior, the Father, and the life-giving Spirit
Other major aspects are related to incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, descension, and indwelling
When Paul said that he forgave in the person of Christ, he was saying that he forgave in the index of the Lord's inward being
In 2 Corinthians 2:10 Paul seemed to be saying, 'I do not forgive according to my personal feeling or preference
We may do some great work, but we may not accomplish anything as far as the building up of the Body is concerned
Because he enjoyed the truth of Christ, His reality, he knew that what he was relating to the Corinthians was of the truth of Christ
As we contact others in the meekness and gentleness of Christ, we need to speak as the truth of Christ is in us
The love of God is the source of the grace of Christ, and that the grace of Christ is the expression of the love of God
If we all experience and enjoy the riches of Christ, we shall have much to speak concerning Christ whenever we come together
We shall not speak about doctrine or gifts, but about the genuine experience of Christ and the real enjoyment of the riches of Christ
The more the riches of Christ are dispensed into us, the more we shall be sanctified and metabolically transformed
If we are filled in spirit unto all the fullness of God, we shall spontaneously speak to one another concerning Christ
If you visit a country where there is the practice of idol worship, you can see that idol worshippers worship their gods in a dumb way
As we speak to one another of our experiences of Christ, we should not wait for some kind of formal beginning of the meetings
If we have been set free from tradition, we shall speak spontaneously as we come together in the meetings of the church
Such singing and psalming are not only the overflow of being filled in spirit, but also the way to be filled in spirit
According to this understanding, someone predicts the future and concludes his speaking with the words, 'Thus saith the Lord'
Isaiah 1:3 says, 'The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider'
To speak in this manner is to prophesy in the sense of uttering something of the Lord and on behalf of the Lord
If we intend to be scriptural in a comprehensive way, we need to accept the biblical understanding of prophecy
In 1 Corinthians 14:31 Paul says, 'For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted'
If prophecy were mainly a matter of predicting the future, how would it be possible for all the saints to prophesy?
Concerning this matter of speaking for the Lord, some believe that they should wait until the Spirit comes upon them
If this is the experience of every one of us, there will be no need for so much singing or preaching in the meetings
May the Lord be merciful to us in the church life that we may contact Him day by day and live according to the index of His inner being
The more we speak, the more we shall be filled with Him; and the more we are filled with Him, the more we shall speak of Him
The book of Ephesians reveals that God's economy is to work Christ into His chosen people to produce the church
According to our natural concept, we may expect Ephesians to emphasize such negative things as sin and worldliness
Although these are dealt with, they are not the main factors revealed in Ephesians as causes of damage to the church life
When we read about sin in the Scriptures, we readily understand, for the concept of sin is already in our natural mentality
We have indicated that sin and worldliness, although certainly causes of damage, are not the basic negative factors in this book
Today there is enmity even among good, spiritual Christians, enmity caused by ordinances regarding certain practices
In 4:14 Paul says that we should 'be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching'
Any doctrine even a scriptural one that distracts the believers from Christ is a wind of teaching that carries them away from Gods economy
If we intend to have the proper church life, we must recognize the damage doctrine has caused to the Body of Christ
In chapter four Paul goes on to speak of the old man , the third category of negative things that damage the church
You may have read this book without paying attention to the matters of ordinances, doctrines, the old man, and spots and wrinkles
Through ordinances Satan has spoiled the oneness of the humanity created by God for the fulfillment of His purpose
Although there is such an international organization as the United Nations, it is a fact that the nations are far from united
If we can overcome the difficulty presented by language, a great part of our problem with ordinances will be solved
On that day the divisions caused by language were overcome, and the church as the one new man came into existence
Although we find pray-reading helpful, we should not make an ordinance concerning it or insist that others practice it
It is the tendency of Christians to create ordinances related to those practices which they personally find helpful
Many of the Christians in this chairshaking group are noted for their prevailing preaching of the gospel among the mountain people in Taiwan
In the early days of the church life in Los Angeles, some saints had a problem over the playing of tambourines in the meetings
Eventually, the ordinances concerning tambourines kept a number of saints from participating in the church life
The Apostle Paul was very clear about ordinances, and he knew the futility of debating whether certain practices are right or wrong
If we did not love the Lord, division would not present such a serious problem, for we would probably all be distracted by worldly endeavors
As long as the saints in a locality are for the Lord and are standing on the proper ground of the church, we should be one with them
What we need is to be strengthened into our inner man and filled with the riches of Christ unto all the fullness of God
If we consider verse 13 in the light of verse 12, we shall realize that here the emphasis is upon becoming near to one another
Because we were fallen, we were far off from Christ, from the commonwealth of Israel, and from the covenants of God's promise
The gospel of peace involves not only the peace between man and God, but especially the peace between one man and another
Just as there was enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles at the time of Paul, so there is enmity among peoples today
Before the foundation of the world, God chose people from various nations to be part of the one Body and the one new man
According to the natural constitution, it is not possible for Chinese to be one with Japanese or French to be one with Germans
He also reminds us that we were apart from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise
Having been redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, we have spontaneously become near not only to God but also to one another
By Christ's abolishing the ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, peace was made between all believers
The point we are burdened to emphasize in this message is that on the cross Christ has slain all the ordinances
Many Christians know that on the cross Christ dealt with sin, the flesh, the self, the old man, the world, and the Devil
Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility for there to be any natural person
If we consider our situation by analyzing in the mind, the natural differences will become apparent once again
We may prove our point by quoting Ephesians 3:17, a verse which speaks about Christ making His home in our hearts
We should always focus our attention on Christ and not become involved in disputes over doctrines or practices
Admittedly, it takes a great deal of learning and experience to know how to minister Christ to others in this way
It is important for us to learn how to adapt to meetings that differ from our own and how to function in those meetings properly
For the sake of oneness and for the ministry of life, we shall be able to adapt to the way practiced by others in their meetings
Do not think that simply because those in a particular locality emphasize the Pentecostal gifts, they are not a proper local church
If you insist that they are not a genuine local church, they may say the same thing about the church in your locality
For the proper church life, we must set aside all the ordinances and concentrate on ministering Christ to the saints
Ephesians 2 is an important chapter because it reveals that Christ died on the cross in order to create in Himself one new man
Christians realize that on the cross Christ dealt with sin, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the Devil, Satan
Because ordinances seem helpful, it is difficult to recognize that they also need to be dealt with by the cross
If we view the redemption of Christ from the angle of God's purpose, our concept of redemption will be broadened
In order to redeem divided mankind, Christ died on the cross to deal with all the negative things, including ordinances
On the cross Christ abolished all the regulations regarding living and worship, regulations that have divided the nations
By abolishing the ordinances and creating the Jewish and Gentile believers into one new man, Christ has made peace
No matter where we may go, even if we try to run from the Lord or to stop believing in Him, He will always be with us
Now in Christ Jesus we who once were far off from God and from one another have become near in the blood of Christ
As verse 14 says, the very Christ who is our peace has made us one and has broken down the middle wall of partition
The result is that we are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God
In 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul said, 'For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ'
It seems that underneath Christ as the foundation the denominations have something other than Christ as their basic foundation
We cannot receive into the church anyone who refuses to recognize the deity of Christ, who denies that Christ is God incarnate
Believers should not be rejected over things such as the size of cup used at the Lord's table or over the practice of foot-washing
As the cornerstone, He joins the two walls, the one of the Jewish believers and the other of the Gentile believers
In verse 21 Paul goes on to say, 'In Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord'
In Christ as the foundation and the cornerstone, all the building, the universal church, is fitted together and is growing in the Lord
According to the context, the holy temple in verse 21 is universal, whereas the dwelling place of God in verse 22 is local
Some may persist with their questions by saying that we need to be practical and must know how to baptize new converts
If we seriously seek His leading, He will certainly guide us, and we shall know how to take care of the various practical matters
If our trust is in anything other than Christ, that thing will become an ordinance which will damage the church life
If we take Christ as our everything, all the local churches throughout the world will grow and go on in a healthy way
The words 'in Whom you also' in verse 22 denote the local building, the building among those in the city to which this Epistle was sent
To hold to certain ordinances is to build without a proper foundation, that is, without Christ as the unique foundation
Some church-traveling Christians may claim that the reason for their wandering from group to group is a sense of dissatisfaction
They may think that a particular group suits their taste, only to learn that certain practices there do not match their disposition
The recovery is not based on any practice; it is based on Christ who is our peace, our foundation, our cornerstone, and our everything
Those who have seen this vision and are governed by it can be built up with others on the unique foundation of the all-inclusive Christ
Although we have not made pray-reading an ordinance, some have left the church life simply because they did not care for this practice
If we in the local churches have something related to idols immorality division or the denial of the deity of Christ we should be criticized
Those who do not follow these practices should nevertheless be one with those who receive benefit by following them
Suppose a certain brother is convicted of his oldness and deadness and is led of the Lord to bury himself in the waters of baptism
Should he be condemned because he was baptized a second time or because he praises the Lord with a loud voice?
Some believers may criticize such a one because they still have ordinances related to baptism or to loud praises
When there was no change or improvement, you moved to another group, hoping to find there a situation to suit your preference
Although it is true that we are satisfied spiritually in the church, we must be careful not to hold to any ordinances
The more we care for Christ and drop all manner of ordinances, the more we shall be built up in Christ locally and also universally
The churches will be built together universally, but this does not mean that they will be universally organized
If we isolate ourselves from the other churches, we cut ourselves off both from the transfusion and from the circulation of life in the Body
In 2:22 Paul speaks of the local building: 'In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
Paul is careful to point out that it is in Christ that the local saints are built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
If we are not built up with others in our own locality, we should not expect to be able to be built up in any other locality
All those who are burdened to migrate for the spread of the church life must firstly be built up in their own locality
If you have been in a locality for a period of time without being built up with others, there must be a reason for this lack of building
If you are willing to be built into the church in your locality, you will have the abundance of the growth in life
Although they are in the local church, they have the tendency to withdraw or to hold back when certain situations arise in the church
Of withdrawing or holding back, we should be willing to be broken and even 'wrecked' in order to be built up with others
If we grow in this way, the church life will spread both through us and with us, and we shall be useful in any coming migration
Any who have reservations about the church, yet who desire to participate in a migration, will be a cause of frustration
We should always give in to Him and be willing to be broken so that we may be built into the church in our locality
If we hold to Christ as everything to us, we shall experience the genuine building, first locally and then universally
In order to recover the church, the Lord must cause His people to set aside the ordinances that have been the cause of division
Since there is no organization nor human control in the recovery, it is possible in certain places for saints to insist on various practices
On the one hand, doctrines produce ordinances, but, on the other hand, ordinances provide the basis for doctrine
In order for such a dispensation to take place, the inner man of all those who make up the one new man must be strengthened by the Spirit
Although Christ has abolished all the ordinances in order to create the new man, the church as the new man still needs to be built up
On the first day of the week He was resurrected from among the dead, and a new age with a new humanity came into being
His economy is based on the principle of incarnation, that is, of God and man mingled and working together to accomplish God's goal
The very fact that Christ was incarnated indicates that God's economy has both the divine aspect and the human aspect
The teachings systematized by Satan cause serious error and thus damage the practical oneness of the Body life
Many Christians have been lured by the 'bait' of doctrine, only to be caught on the 'hook' concealed within it
In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, 'But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, Who is the Head, Christ'
The concept in God's economy is that God's people mainly need to be fed by having the riches of Christ ministered to them
In all the churches in the Lord's recovery we need more feeding with the riches of Christ and less teaching of doctrine
Revelation also speaks of the seven stars, the seven lampstands, the tree of life, and the river of water of life
We should come to the Scriptures not primarily to learn doctrine, but mainly to be nourished by the living bread
If we do this, we shall eventually arrive at a full-grown man and no longer be those carried about by winds of teaching
Those who want to discuss doctrine under the guise of having fellowship may be influenced by the cunning craftiness of Satan
Let us beware of Satans subtle use of doctrine to distract us from Gods economy and let us pay attention to feeding nourishment and growth
We have pointed out that doctrine is included among the four categories of negative things that damage the church life
According to the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus had a difficult time with those religious people who were steeped in doctrine
Little did they realize that they were actually arguing with God, the One who inspired the Old Testament on which their doctrines were based
In their blindness they used the Scriptures to argue with the One who inspired the Scriptures and whose coming the Scriptures foretold
They did not realize that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, God was not concerned for doctrine, but for Christ
After the church had been established and had begun to spread, problems in the churches were caused by doctrine
Just as doctrine caused damage to the church life in the first century, it can damage the church life in the Lord's recovery today
In a sense, it may be a dreadful thing to acquire a vast knowledge of the Bible, if our Bible knowledge causes us to miss Christ
Remember that it was those who knew the Scriptures-the Pharisees and the scribes-who persecuted the Lord Jesus and the apostles
Even doctrines that are scriptural or fundamental may be used by the enemy to distract us from Christ and the church
Doctrines are among the good things utilized by Satan in his subtlety to distract God's people from God's will
The reason is that, as far as doctrine is concerned, sisters are subjective, whereas the brothers are objective
Ephesians 2:22 speaks of the building up of the church, but it gives only the principles; it does not give the details
There will be the operation in the measure of each part and the result will be the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love
A mother does not perfect her baby by teaching him to use the various parts of his body; she perfects him by feeding him
The more a child grows through receiving proper nourishment, the more the members of his body will come into their function
In the same principle, the members of the Body are perfected not by teaching, but through the feeding that causes them to grow
The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience
Paul says, 'Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away, concerning the faith have made shipwreck'
Although Paul in Ephesians 4 makes a clear distinction between the faith and doctrine, many Christians confuse these two things
Although all genuine Christians have the faith and salvation in common, we may not have all doctrines in common
As far as doctrines are concerned, we must be liberal toward others, because doctrines have nothing to do with our common salvation
The more we enjoy Christ and are nourished by the ministry of Christ, the more willing we shall become to lay aside our doctrines
As the years have gone by and they have enjoyed the ministry of Christ, they have gradually dropped these toys
Just as children will play with their toys until they grow up so the believers will be occupied with doctrine until they grow more in Christ
As we grow, we shall arrive not at the oneness of doctrine, but at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God
In the meetings of the church our emphasis is not on Bible teaching it is on helping the saints to know the living Christ and to grow in Him
Only by growing in this way shall we be no longer children tossed by waves and carried about by winds of doctrine
Through the growth of life, we shall also arrive at a full-grown man and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
When the Lord's work in His recovery began in this country a number of years ago, we could see very little of the measure of this stature
The more we grow, the more we shall be able to function and to have the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love
Regarding the faith-what we must believe in order to be saved-the New Testament is strong, strict, and consistent
In Jude 3 we are even told that we 'should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints'
We should not merely insist on the faith and stand for it, but fight for it at any cost, even at the cost of our life
Although Paul was liberal with respect to doctrine, he would not tolerate anything related to fornication or idolatry
According to the Second Epistle of John, we see that we must also reject those who deny the incarnation of Christ
Verse 7 says, 'For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
In verse 9 the writer goes on to say, 'Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God
Concerning the faith, we must be bold, strong, and definite, ready to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints
Today many Christian teachers are talking about the Body in Romans 12 without paying adequate attention to Romans 14
There is more division among earnest Christians than among those who are worldly or indifferent to the Lord and His Word
It is a very positive sign that the church can include both those sisters who wear a head covering and those who do not
Those who are preoccupied with doctrine often argue about whether or not certain doctrines or practices are scriptural
We can declare that the most scriptural meeting is the meeting in which believers with different doctrines are received
About a century and a half ago, the Brethren were raised up by the Lord and came to see many truths in the Bible
If you visit certain Brethren assemblies they may argue with you about doctrine yet have little care for the Spirit or for the living Christ
In the Lord's recovery we have escaped from the trap of doctrine and are being brought back to the Lord Himself
His intention is to have a people who have been regenerated, sanctified, purified, transformed, and built up as the one new man
God's concern is that we be filled with Christ, nourished by Christ, and built up in Christ as a proper church
As we all know, these two things have taken place, the re-formation of Israel in 1948 and the return of Jerusalem in 1967
According to the Lord's word in Luke 21:24, the return of Jerusalem indicates the fullness of the age of the Gentiles
We simply cannot deny the fact that so many of the saints in the Lord's recovery love the Lord Jesus in an absolute way
There may not be time for the Lord to begin another work apart from the recovery as a preparation of the Bride
We must admit the fact that no Christians love the Lord more than those in the churches in the Lord's recovery
Just as a child is perfected through growth, so the new man created in Christ is also perfected through growth
In 2:15 we see the creation of the new man organically, but in 4:13-16 we see the perfecting of the new man in relation to his function
The growth of the Body is the increase of Christ in the church, which results in the building up of the Body itself
We have pointed out that the new man can become perfect in relation to his functions only through receiving the proper nourishment
In Christianity today the ministers, pastors, and preachers mainly teach the people and thereby build up a religion instead of the Body
In Ephesians 4, a chapter that speaks of the perfecting of the new man through the growth of life, doctrine is depreciated
What is needed for the building up of the Body and for perfecting the new man functionally is the growth of life
These gifted ones are given 'for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
Through growth their function comes forth, and they function according to the effectual working in their measure
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
Following this, He ascended to the third heaven, and all the divine fullness was committed to Him along with all of God's chosen people
The Lord Jesus appeared to Saul of Tarsus and spontaneously even in his ignorance Saul called upon His name saying Who art thou Lord
From the time of His ascension, Christ has been working to constitute the vanquished foes into gifts for His Body
Eventually, those who once were His enemies are transformed and constituted into useful gifts that can be presented to the Body
We have seen that in chapter two we have the creation of the new man and in chapter four, the growth of the new man
In order for the new man to grow, we need to experience the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and descending Christ
Ordinances are obstacles to the formation of the new man, and doctrines are frustrations to the growth of the new man
All those who desire to migrate for the spread of the church life must realize that migration is not a movement
According to His mercy, may the Body be preserved both from any shortage and from cancer caused by overfunction
The more we are saturated with Christ, the more we become in reality parts of the Body with a particular measure of function
Because the book of Ephesians is a book on the church, we should view everything in it from the perspective of the church
These verses are not written in relation to the lives of individuals, but in relation to the corporate life of the one new man
To put on the new man means to have the church life, which is the new life of the new mankind created by Christ in Himself
To put off the old man is not merely to put off the old nature; it is to put off the old way of life, the former way of living
Our old way of living was not entirely an individualistic way of life, for it involved our social life, our community life
The fact that the saints often linger after the meetings are dismissed indicates that in the church we have a genuine community life
If we would be the one new man, we must put off the community life of the old man and put on the community life of the new man
It is part of the living of the old man that must be put off if we are to practice the church life as the one new man
Sometimes in the church life those of a certain nationality may cluster together and converse in their native language instead of English
In the church life in the Lord's recovery, we should no longer live according to the former conduct of the old man
The Lord's intention today is not simply to gather us together, but to cause us to put off the life of the old man
May we all look to the Lord and pray, 'Lord, deliver my mind from vanity and fill it with the reality of the Spirit
We shall have not only the creation of the new man, but the new man growing and functioning with a proper daily living
We do not have the church life simply by coming together in the meetings to sing, pray-read, praise the Lord, and give testimonies
Whenever we return to the old manner of life, we shall spontaneously sense that we are darkened within and estranged from God's life
If we persist in living according to the former manner of life, we shall eventually become calloused and insensitive
There may in fact be nothing wrong with it, but it causes you to be darkened and estranged from the life of God
In 4:20 Paul speaks of learning Christ and in verse 21, of having been 'taught in Him as the truth is in Jesus'
The truth in Jesus is the real situation of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels, a life filled with truth, reality
If we all live in a way that is heavenly, divine, righteous, holy, and glorious, we shall have a wonderful community life in the church
Toward the end of chapter four Paul says, 'And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption'
If you study the Bible from Genesis 6 through Revelation 20, you will see that all of fallen mankind lives in the vanity of the mind
In the church as the new man, we should live not according to the vanity of the mind, but according to the spirit of the mind
Such a spirit is given to us by God so that we may have wisdom and revelation to know Him and to know His economy
Just as we must use the proper organs to see, hear, and taste, so we must use the proper organ-the spirit-in dealing with the church
Our heart is composed of all the parts of the soul-the mind, emotion, and will-plus the conscience, the main part of our spirit
As we consider all these references to the spirit in this short book, we see that the church life is altogether a matter in the spirit
He points out that their hearts are hard, that they have ceased from feeling, and that they have given themselves over to lewdness
The reason we hesitate to follow the Lord is that we consider too much in the mind or care for our emotional concerns
If we set aside our considerations and concerns and make a firm decision to follow the Lord absolutely, our sky will be clear
The reason certain ones who have been with us for a number of years have not improved much is that they live in the vanity of the mind
If such brothers and sisters turn from the vanity of the mind to the spirit of the mind, they will undergo a great change
Listening to messages is of little help unless we are in the spirit of the mind instead of in the vanity of the mind
In the church life we should not care for outward correction or adjustment; we should care for inward renewing
The more we turn to the spirit of the mind and walk in the spirit of the mind, the more our mind will be renewed
According to Paul's word in chapter four, the new man must grow and live by walking in the spirit of the mind and must be renewed daily
In the New Testament, this word sometimes translated piety is virtue according to the divine character expressed through humanity
Confucius taught a threefold submission: to the father, to the husband, and, if the husband should die, to the son
What is the difference between submission according to the teaching of Confucius and submission according to the teaching of the Bible?
Our behavior will not be a mere human virtue; it will be a virtue with the divine character and with the flavor of Christ
Although the followers of Confucius may attain a high ethical standard, there is no flavor of Christ in their virtue
If we live according to the spirit of the mind, there will be in the church life the expression of the divine character
In previous messages we have considered three categories of negative things that damage the church life ordinances doctrine and the old man
After these three categories of negative things have been dealt with, we must still face the problem of the spots and wrinkles
Because they are so subjective, the spots and wrinkles are more difficult to deal with than the ordinances, the doctrines, and the old man
We cannot simply abolish the spots and wrinkles or put them off, for they are in our organic tissue and natural makeup
If a particular way is prevailing, it is not because of the way itself, but because of the life contained in that way and released by it
We should forget about trying to improve ourselves and concentrate instead on experiencing the sanctifying riches of Christ
If we are clear about this, we shall realize that mere teachings can do nothing to eliminate spots and wrinkles
Only the sanctifying element which comes through the nourishing and cherishing of Christ can deal with such things
Apart from Ephesians 5, there is no way for the Bride to be prepared, and hence no way for Revelation 19 to be fulfilled
It is very significant that the Lord has spoken to us about ordinances, doctrines, the old man, and the spots and wrinkles
It is crucial that we experience the nourishing, cherishing, sanctifying, and purifying riches of Christ to remove our oldness and defects
In chapter one we have a general sketch of the church, and in chapter two, the creation, birth, and formation of the one new man
The growth in chapter four is for the function of the new man, whereas the beauty in chapter five is for the presentation of the Bride
After saying so much about the church in chapters one through four, Paul goes on in chapter five to speak about the church as the Bride
When Christ presents the church to Himself, the church will not be a strong man; she will be a beautiful Bride
In order to be the Bride of Christ, the church must become beautiful and have all the spots and wrinkles removed
In the same principle, today we must prepare ourselves to be the Bride by taking in the element of Christ's riches as our nourishment
Eventually the Lord will show us that what He cares for is not our ability He cares for the beauty of Himself expressed through our humanity
The church that will be presented to Him will be glorious and beautiful, a church without spot, wrinkle, or any such thing
In the church as the one new man there is strength and ability, but with the church as the Bride there is beauty and glory
We should learn somewhat to depreciate our ability and strength, for as part of the Bride, we shall be not male, but female
Ephesians shows how Christ prepares the Bride by sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing us with Himself
In this way we are metabolically transformed and we become beautiful and glorious ready to be presented to Christ according to Revelation 19
The fact that the clothing of the Bride is pure means not only that it is without dirt, but also that it is without mixture
The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective, that we might meet the requirement of the righteous God
The more this subjective righteousness is wrought into the church, the more she is prepared to become the Bride
They need to have the subjective righteousness interwoven into their very being in order to have the fine linen, bright and pure
Since Jerusalem has been restored to the nation of Israel, the coming back of the Lord Jesus should not be far off
Some may say that the work of preparing the Bride is among the spiritual ones in Catholicism, the denominations, and the independent groups
According to this view, Christ will gather together all these spiritual ones and form them into His Bride at the time of His coming
He is not coming to collect those who will constitute the Bride; He is coming to present to Himself the Bride who has already been prepared
Those who make up the Bride must not only be mature in life; they must also be built together as the one Bride
When we turned to the way of the Lord's recovery, we had the sense deep within that the Lord had put His seal on the way we are taking
The primary work of the Lord in His recovery is not to preach the gospel throughout the earth; it is to prepare His Bride
He is sending out the call to overcome the degradation of Christianity so that a number of those who seek Him may be prepared as His Bride
Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and the new earth
Some things are still in a state of collapse because the process of the heading up of all things in Christ has not yet been completed
Just as clothing and other items rest on a person's body, so one day everything in the universe will rest on Christ's Body, the church
If all the things in the universe are not headed up in Christ through His Body, they will remain in a state of collapse
At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, to indicate that we belong to God
Without the church as the Body to match Christ as the Head, it will not be possible for God to head up all things in Christ
The heading up of all things is accomplished by the Head, but it cannot be accomplished without a Body for the Head
We, God's redeemed ones, the church, are God's possession, acquired by His purchase with the precious blood of Christ
As God's inheritance and possession, we are the Body of Christ, through which all things in the universe are being headed up in Christ
The more we, God's inheritance, are saturated with the Spirit as the living seal, the more heading up there will be in the universe
When God's possession has been wholly saturated with the Spirit as the living seal, the heading up of all things in Christ will be completed
As we have seen, this heading up of all things in Christ depends on God's possession, the church, being saturated with Himself
The church is headed up, and then the things related to the church and that rest on the church will be headed up also
If we allow Christ to saturate us thoroughly, eventually we shall see the completion of the heading up of all things in Christ
The heading up of all things in Christ takes place as the Triune God works Himself into man as the center of His creation
Through this marvelous transmission we become the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
In Ephesians 3 we see experientially that the very Christ who is Head over all things is actually transmitted into us
We may say that our heart is the battery and that Christ is the heavenly electricity that is being transmitted into the heart of the battery
Through this transmission and the spread of Christ within us God is heading up all things in Christ through the church
In their amazement at such a oneness, some have thought that we must have set up an organization to maintain this oneness
We do not have such an organization, and there is no possibility that any organization could produce such a oneness
We can be one simply because we are being headed up in Christ through the transmission of Christ into our being
Eventually, in the dispensation of the fullness of times, the whole universe will be headed up in Christ through the church
The day is coming when the earth will see not only the uniting, nor even just the building up, but the heading up of all things in Christ
Christ is Head over all things to the church, and now He is in the process of heading up all things through the church
For Christ to make His home in the heart of the church means that He is transfused into the center of the church's inner being
In another sense, the church is the Bride who must be beautified in order to be presented to Christ at His coming
According to Revelation 19, the church is both the Bride who is presented to Christ and the warrior who fights with Him against God's enemy
In verse 14 we see that the armies which follow the Lord into battle are 'dressed in fine linen, white and pure'
These verses indicate that the Bride's wedding garment will also be the uniform she wears as God's army to fight against His enemy
Spiritual warfare is not an individual matter; it is a matter of the Body, a corporate entity to fight the battle against God's enemy
The whole armor of God consists of the girdle, the breastplate, the shoes, the shield, the helmet, and the sword
According to verse 18, we receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit by means of all prayer and petition
As we have pointed out many times, we can be in spirit simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus from deep within
Immediately, our praying and reading become living, and we are empowered by Christ and covered with Him as our armor
Because we pray in spirit to apply all the aspects of Christ as the armor, spiritual fighting becomes an enjoyment
We enjoy Christ as the helmet of salvation that covers our head, and also as the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God
We feast in the presence of the enemy, enjoying Christ as reality, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation, and as the living word of God
Because the enemy's elements are within us, we need the killing power of the word to be applied to our being subjectively
If you consider your spiritual experience, you will realize that much of the enemy's attack upon you comes from within
The more we take in the word with its killing power, the more our pride and all the negative elements within us are put to death
After a time of pray-reading the word, we may discover that the adversary who was attacking us has disappeared
The more we take the word of God by means of all prayer in spirit, the more the negative things within us will be put to death
It is to help you experience Christ subjectively as all the aspects of the armor, especially as the sword of the Spirit
In Ephesians 6 the word is for killing that enables the church as the corporate warrior to engage in spiritual warfare
Although we may rejoice that the enemy outwardly is fleeing, we are still troubled by the adversary within us who remains
As we consider all these messages on the book of Ephesians, we need to thank the Lord that we are in His recovery
The Lord will be victorious, He will gain all the ground within us, and He will prepare the way for His coming back
