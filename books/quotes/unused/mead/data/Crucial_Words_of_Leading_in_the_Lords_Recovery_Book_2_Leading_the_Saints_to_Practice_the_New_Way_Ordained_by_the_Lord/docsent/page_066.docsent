   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LETTING THE HOLY SPIRIT BE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRESIDING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The principle of the discussion of church affairs in the elders meeting is to let the Holy Spirit be the presiding One.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the elders meeting, we should never elect a presiding officer; if we elect one, we annul the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to believe that every time we meet together, the Lord is in our midst Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the Lord is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , that is, the Holy Spirit, who is with us in all the gatherings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The elders meeting is no exception, and it surely has the presence of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must bear in mind that to elect someone to preside over the meeting is offensive to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church the Holy Spirit is the presiding One in all the meetings; thus, we should not have another presiding officer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The unique presiding One is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ALL ATTENDANTS BRINGING UP</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MATTERS FOR DECISION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>BY FOLLOWING THE LORD S LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the elders meeting, all the attendants may bring up matters to be decided upon by following the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need for an agenda in the elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the elders come together, if someone senses the leading within to mention a certain matter that needs a decision, he may mention it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After this, everyone needs to seek the Lord s leading together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Perhaps some may have the same feeling, and some may have a different feeling; all may speak forth their feeling so that everyone may seek the Lord s leading together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can see this principle clearly from the example in Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LEARNING TO FOLLOW THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>IN DISCUSSING MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the elders meeting, we need to learn to follow the Holy Spirit in discussing matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the elders should not only be elders but also priests who draw near to God and contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not sufficient for the elders to merely carry out the administration of the church; they must have direct contact with God and seek God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their relationship with God must be so intimate that He can tell them His intention at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God tells man His intention by two means: the Bible and the Holy Spirit, which is represented by the breastplate of judgment in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither Democracy nor Autocracy</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>but Theocracy</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the elders follow the Holy Spirit in discussing matters, there is neither a democracy nor an autocracy but a theocracy, that is, the rule of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the elders take care of the church administration, they need to fully submit to God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders ruled the children of Israel under God s instructions; hence, strictly speaking, God ruled the children of Israel in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must remember that the way to administrate the church is not like the way worldly governments administrate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today, in both democracies and autocracies, man governs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, God does not want a democracy or an autocracy; rather, He desires that we seek His instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today God s rule is based on the Bible outside of us and on the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the elders must understand the Bible; if they do not understand the Bible, they will not be able to properly discuss and make decisions regarding church matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the Type of the Urim</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>and the Thummim in the Old Testament The Names of the Twelve Tribes of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>on the Breastplate of the High Priest</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Containing Eighteen of the Twenty-two Letters</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>in the Hebrew Alphabet</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since the Bible does not provide an answer to every question, the elders not only need to understand the Bible but also need the Holy Spirit to give them revelation through the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Holy Spirit is typified by the breastplate of judgment worn by the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This breastplate was composed of twelve stones upon which were engraved the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These twelve names contained eighteen of the twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, four letters were missing.</S>
