<div class='line'><b>1</b> We have an inner life; that's for our daily life;</div>
<div class='line'>That's for the meeting life - just Christ!</div>
<div class='line'>We'll live the inner life; we'll have the daily life;</div>

<div class='line'><b>2</b> Christ is our inner life; He's in our spirit now;</div>
<div class='line'>Not far away from us - He's right inside!</div>
<div class='line'>And as we turn to Him and take Him as our all</div>
<div class='line'>He will become in us our inner life.</div>

<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> Out from our inner life will come our daily life,</div>
<div class='line'>And all our living be filled up with Christ.</div>
<div class='line'>Then as we live by Him, He lives His life in us,</div>
<div class='line'>And He becomes to us our daily life.</div>

<div class='line'><b>4</b> The real experience of Christ in daily life,</div>
<div class='line'>Will fill the meeting life with Christ Himself.</div>
<div class='line'>Not empty forms and such, but Christ will be so much;</div>
<div class='line'>And we will see Him here as the meeting life.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> Without the inner life there is no daily life,</div>
<div class='line'>There is no meeting life, there is no church!</div>
<div class='line'>Christ as our inner life, Christ in our daily life</div>
<div class='line'>Will make the meeting life new and glorious!</div>
