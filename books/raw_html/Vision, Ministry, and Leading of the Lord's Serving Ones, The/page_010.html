        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BEING LED CORPORATELY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 15:36-41; 16:6-7</h1>
<p>The leading in the work is not individual but corporate; it is a leading in the Body. Concerning this point, we need to read Acts 13 and pay particular attention to how the apostles worked and were led. After the ascension of the Lord Jesus, an important aspect of the disciples&rsquo; work on the earth involved their corporate leading; it is hard to find an example of anyone who was led individually or acted individually in Acts. Although it may seem as though Philip acted and was led individualistically in the gospel, the account in Acts shows that his leading was a part of the Lord&rsquo;s corporate leading, which was confirmed by the Body (8:5-17).</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING PERSONAL AFFECTION</h2>
<p>In the corporate leading in the work, we also must be careful not to bring personal affection into the work. In Acts 15 there was contention between Barnabas and Paul over the leading that they received. Although they both received the leading to visit the brothers, they differed on the matter of whether or not to take Mark. Barnabas insisted on taking Mark, but Paul did not consider it &ldquo;suitable to take with them this one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work&rdquo; (v. 38).</p>
<p>Based on the account in Acts, the record of this contention between the two seems simple, but Colossians 4:10, which identifies Mark as being a cousin of Barnabas, reveals the further complication. Barnabas and Mark were relatives, and Barnabas&rsquo;s insistence that Mark be taken could easily have been influenced by family attachments and personal affection.</p>
<p>When Barnabas, Paul, and Mark had gone out to work, they encountered difficulty at Pamphylia, and Mark withdrew (Acts 13:13). Mark&rsquo;s withdrawal was unacceptable to Paul because it violated a principle related to spiritual warfare. Just as soldiers on the frontline of a battle should not withdraw, those who work for the Lord should not withdraw, because their withdrawal affects those who remain. It was good that Paul and Barnabas were not stumbled when Mark withdrew.</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s withdrawal, however, did affect Paul&rsquo;s consideration when they were preparing to go out a second time. Paul felt that Mark needed to be disciplined by being restricted from going with them the second time. Paul&rsquo;s willingness to restrict Mark from going was his execution of God&rsquo;s government in the work. The Lord&rsquo;s work cannot be carried out if a serving one acts according to his feeling, that is, if he works when he has a feeling to work and abandons the work when he has no feeling. Individuals cannot do as they please in the corporate move of the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Often the only way that a servant of the Lord can administer discipline is to first allow such ones to act according to their feelings but then to not allow them to later participate in the work according to their feeling. For example, Paul, Barnabas, and Mark were all led to participate in the work, but when Mark could not endure the suffering at Pamphylia, he withdrew. As a servant of the Lord, Paul could not force Mark to stay, but he could discipline Mark by not allowing him to go a second time. As a further example, if some brothers in a certain place do not want to receive my speaking, the only thing that I can do is to not go there to speak. In effect, my not going will be a discipline to them. In the Lord&rsquo;s work discipline primarily involves not being allowed to participate in the work. When Mark withdrew, Paul did not stop him from going, but he also did not take Mark with him the next time. This was his discipline of Mark.</p>
<p>Paul did not discipline Mark out of his flesh. Paul knew God well, and he upheld God&rsquo;s governmental principle. Love and affection cannot be allowed to overthrow God&rsquo;s government. God blesses what is according to His principle, and He does not bless what is not according to His principle. Paul&rsquo;s unwillingness to take Mark the second time was an execution of God&rsquo;s government according to the principle of God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Barnabas, however, neglected God&rsquo;s government and God&rsquo;s principle in the work, and he allowed family affection to influence the work. Paul said that they should not take Mark, but Barnabas insisted on taking him. As a result, there was a sharp contention. As a serving one, Barnabas veered from the principle of God&rsquo;s work by holding on to his personal feelings in his human relationships. Paul kept God&rsquo;s principle, whereas Barnabas held on to his personal feelings. This was the source of their contention and separation.</p>
<p>After their contention, Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus. There is, however, no mention of their being sent forth by the brothers (15:39). In contrast, verse 40 says, &ldquo;Paul chose Silas and went out, having been commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.&rdquo; When people contend, the wrong side always acts first, and the right side acts last. From reading this passage in the Bible, we know that the Holy Spirit judged Barnabas&rsquo;s actions to be wrong. Despite the word from Paul and the other brothers, Barnabas took Mark with him. Although the Bible records that the brothers sent Paul and Silas forward, commending them to the grace of the Lord, there is no record of Barnabas being sent in this way. After Barnabas left, he was on his own. Although he no doubt continued to work, the Bible contains no further record of his work. From that point forward, Barnabas did not have the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s principle can never be overlooked, and God&rsquo;s government can never be compromised. We can only accommodate God; God does not accommodate us. We cannot lower God&rsquo;s governmental standard to accommodate ourselves. We should conform to God&rsquo;s principle; we should not expect God to conform to our feelings. Whenever our work is not according to God&rsquo;s principle but according to our feelings, God will set us aside. Personal feelings must never be brought into the work of God.</p>
<p>I have a heavy feeling within me based on years of serving the Lord with the brothers and sisters. In serving the Lord over the years, we have encountered the problem of personal feelings affecting the leading of many brothers and sisters. The source of personal feelings is personal affection. For example, there may be two brothers who have deep relations in the Lord. Nevertheless, whenever the co-workers seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together, it almost always seems as if these two brothers have a sense to work in various places together. Even if the co-workers feel that it is the Lord&rsquo;s will for one brother to go but for the other to remain, the first brother will say that he cannot work if the other brother does not go as well. When the co-workers ask him to consider a different brother, he will say, &ldquo;I am afraid that Brother So-and-so&rsquo;s going may not be of the Lord.&rdquo; Instead of saying, &ldquo;His going may not be of the Lord,&rdquo; which is a lie, he should be truthful and say, &ldquo;His going does not suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This problem is even more serious among the sisters. According to my observation, if two co-workers cannot be separated, they will eventually lose the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. It is difficult for co-working sisters to acknowledge this; consequently, they argue, saying, &ldquo;If the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples in pairs, there should be no problem with us going out in pairs.&rdquo; Nevertheless, our history shows that if a pair of sisters cannot be separated, their work will be based only on human affection.</p>
<p>I hope that the brothers and sisters will learn not to interact with their co-workers based on human affection. This matter must be dealt with completely; personal affections kill the Lord&rsquo;s leading. It is not a simple thing for us to gather together and discuss the matter of our leading. If a co-worker says, &ldquo;The Lord is leading me to Keelung, and it is best for Brother So-and-so to go with me,&rdquo; he should have the full assurance that he is not acting out of personal affection. Personal feelings have no place in the work among the co-workers.</p>
<p>No personal affection should be involved in our leading in the work or even in the work itself. Although a certain brother and I may be close, I must be willing to speak a strong word to him if he makes a mistake in the work. Only in this way will we have a clear and accurate leading in the work.</p>
<p>We should never regard Barnabas&rsquo;s actions toward Mark as trivial; they were based entirely on human affection. One day we will face the situation of Barnabas, so we need to take precautions. It is possible to have weaknesses and to make mistakes in the Lord&rsquo;s work, but this does not mean that we have violated God&rsquo;s government. However, whenever we bring in personal affections, we violate a governmental principle in the work. We must fear human affections more than falling, sinning, or making mistakes. Related to the work, personal affections are more serious than falling, sinning, or making mistakes. Personal affections will cause us to veer from the line of the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
