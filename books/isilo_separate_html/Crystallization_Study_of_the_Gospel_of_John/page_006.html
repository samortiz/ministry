In the Incarnation</H2><P>Christ is also seen in the incarnation of the invisible God to be a visible man (John 1:14), partaking of man's flesh and blood (Heb. 2:14), for the redemption of the lost universe to bring in the New Testament age. The incarnated God has blood. Acts 20:28 says that God purchased the church with His own blood. God partook of man's flesh and blood for the redemption of the lost universe. The entire universe, including the heavens, was contaminated by Satan, an archangel created by God, in his rebellion against God. This first rebel caused the entire universe to become lost, so all things on earth and in the heavens needed to be redeemed by God (Col. 1:20). Without Christ's redemption, they could not have remained for so many years. The solar system is still going on due to Christ's redemption.</P><P>Christ redeemed the universe by becoming a man. The New Testament age began at the incarnation of Christ. It is significant that the entire world today uses one calendar, which counts the years from Christ's incarnation. Creation brought in a universe, but this universe became lost. Then God came to be a man by the name of Jesus with a human nature to redeem the lost universe back to a new age, the New Testament age, starting from the day Christ was born.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Becoming the Lamb</H2><P>Christ is also revealed in His becoming the Lamb to take away the sin of the world (mankind) judicially for the New Testament (John 1:29, 36). This is the third great event in the history of the universe. When He was put to death on the cross, God considered Him the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. He became a man for the purpose of redeeming the lost universe, yet He still needed to take a further step to go to the cross to die, bearing the sins of mankind on the cross as the Lamb.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In Becoming the Spirit</H2><P>John 1 first speaks of Christ as the Word. Then it reveals that this Word speaks for God through His creation. Then He speaks further for God through His incarnation and in His being the Lamb. The fourth great event in the history of the universe, through which Christ as the Word speaks, is His becoming the Spirit. John 1:32 says, "And John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him." This is the Spirit descending as a dove upon the Lamb. Christ was the Lamb. Then He became the dove, the Spirit. Christ is revealed in John 1 in His becoming the Spirit for the transformation of God's redeemed people into stones (vv. 32-42) for the building of God's house (Bethel&#151;v. 51) organically for the New Testament.</P><P>We need to be not only redeemed but also transformed. If we were merely redeemed, we would still remain men. In order to become like God, we need transformation. The first step of transformation is to regenerate, to remake, us. Even though we were made in the image of God and after the likeness of God, we still do not have anything real of God in us until we are regenerated. We need to be regenerated to begin our transformation into stones for God's spiritual building, His house. The house of God, Bethel, first is the church, then the Body of Christ, and consummately the New Jerusalem.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
