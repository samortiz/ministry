Although we passed through the valley of the shadow of death, we feared no evil because the Lord was with us. The Lord brought me through the past year almost exclusively through the word in John 17:2a and Isaiah 54:16. As far as the work goes, it is difficult to preach the gospel or to gather any meetings. But we still engage ourselves in visitation. The brothers agreed that I should return home from Shu County on November 21. I stayed in Tsinan for five days, fellowshipping and breaking bread with the saints. On the twenty-eighth, I returned home. Through the Lord's dealing and stripping, I have come to realize my emptiness, uselessness, and the need to prostrate myself before the Lord and to look to His mercy. Since returning home I have been waiting for the Lord's revelation and guidance, seeking to walk in His will and to glorify His name.</p><p>Brother Yuan Lin-shu, December 3</p><h2 class="head2">Mo-Gan-Shan, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Miss Fu-en:</p><p>Someone is leaving for Hungchow tomorrow. Therefore, I am jotting a few lines and asking my friend to relate the rest to you. This will save me another letter. May the almighty God be with all the saints, amen. (1) We are happy to hear that Brother Tang Shou-ling has returned to Shanghai. Please send our greetings to him. (2) Miss Yeh Chui- chung had asked for prayer for Miss Kao. Now she is saved and is diligently studying the Bible. She also has a good understanding. We ask that God heal her sickness. Perhaps this one is a chosen vessel of God. The Lord has been doing all the work in the past. May He continue to grant us grace. Please do not cease your prayer. (3) Thank the Lord for bringing Miss Ruth Lee and the other sisters back to Shanghai. Our two families, Sun and Yu, are safe in the mountains. There is also an opportunity for us to do some work here. Indeed, we have been in the experience of 1 Corinthians 2:9. Praise His name. (4) We have now moved to [omitted]. Because of the school situation for Ming-Bao, the mountains are comparatively safer now. (5) We have received The Christian from Brother Ho Yueh-chiao. Thank you. In the future, please send any new books to us. The mail route is not clear, and delay is unavoidable.</p><p>Sun Wen-yuen, Chen Hsiao-ai, Chen Yao-jen<br />January 13, 1939</p><h2 class="head2">Lan-Si, Chekiang</h2><p>I read about two sums of money in Brother Chao Jing-hwai's letter from Chefoo in Issue No. 13 of The Open Door. On October 1 Brother Lan Tsi-yi wrote to me concerning the same two amounts. Brother Chang Hwei-zhi wrote on October 7 that the wire transfer fee was too high and that he could transfer the amount to us through his account. After further investigation I learned of the circumstances of the intended recipients: Brother Wang Fu-tang's family moved to Yi-Yang and Mr. Yu Teh-hwa was killed by Japanese soldiers. I wrote back to Brother Lan on the twentieth and told him everything. There is no way to forward these two sums. I have not taken out the money from Brother Chang Hwei-zhi's account because I am unable to do a transfer. Please let Brother Lan know about this. On the fourteenth of last month, Lan-Si was bombed for the seventh time. None of God's children were hurt. The houses of two sisters were damaged, but no one was hurt. Over ten brothers and sisters were in the meeting hall, including Brother Mong-tsao and I. Although the glass was shattered and the ceiling fell down, we were not hurt. The flesh suffered some shock, but inwardly we were still at peace. Thank and praise the Father!</p><p>Brother Ma Chuan-foo, en route, January 8</p><h2 class="head2">Ning-Po, Chekiang</h2><p>Brother Yueh-chiao in the Lord:</p><p>Most of the brothers and sisters in Ning-Po are still hiding in the countryside. A few saints have been added to the ones in the city. A few of them would even like to gather together for meetings. They have discussed the matter with me. I also feel quite lonely, especially on the Lord's Day. Presently, however, I only see the need of the members and have not yet discerned the need of the Lord. Hence, I dare not act rashly according to my zeal and set up meetings. May the Lord's mercy and timing come quickly. May He gather His saved children to build up His own Body so that all the members can function according to each one's part. This is our prayer. Please pray for us! Brother Wang Shu-fa from Ping-Yang wrote that he is clear concerning the Lord's calling and will conclude his business next term and then devote himself to serve the church, working in areas around Ping-Yang. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to Sister Ruth Lee and the saints in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother Yu Yun-fei, January 3, 1939</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> </body></html>
