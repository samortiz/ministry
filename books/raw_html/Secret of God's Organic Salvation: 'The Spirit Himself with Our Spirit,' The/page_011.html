<h2 class="head3">6. The Lord&rsquo;s Commission to Peter</h2><p>Because the church needs shepherding, the Lord Jesus commissioned Peter, the apostle appointed by Him, to shepherd His lambs and feed His sheep in his loving of Him (John 21:15-17). As we have pointed out, the Lord charged him to feed His lambs, to shepherd His sheep, and to feed His sheep. Today we need to feed the lambs, the younger ones, and to shepherd the older ones.</p><h2 class="head3">7. The Gifted Persons</h2><p>Christ as the Head gives the Body gifted persons, one kind of which are the shepherds, who perfect the saints by teaching for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-12). Shepherding is very important for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head3">8. The Main Responsibility of the Elders</h2><p>The main responsibility of the elders in the church is to shepherd God&rsquo;s flock by teaching faithfully (1 Pet. 5:2-3; 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17). An elder should be apt to teach (1 Tim. 3:2). The words <i>apt to teach</i> indicate that the elders should have the heart, the desire, and the habit to teach. This is a qualification for one to be an elder. In 1 Timothy 5:17 Paul says that &ldquo;those who labor in word and teaching&rdquo; should be counted worthy of double honor. The elders should labor not in the business affairs but in word and teaching, shepherding God&rsquo;s flock by teaching faithfully.</p><h2 class="head3">9. The Elders&rsquo; Shepherding of the Flock of God<br />Being the Best Way to Take Care<br />of the &ldquo;Fierce Wolves&rdquo;</h2><p>The elders&rsquo; shepherding of the church, the flock of God, is the best way to take care of the &ldquo;fierce wolves&rdquo; and those speaking perverted things among the churches (Acts 20:28-30). Often elders have asked me what they should do about those in the church who speak perverted things. The way for the elders to deal with such a situation is to shepherd the church. Many years of history have proved that the elders&rsquo; shepherding will keep the saints from the &ldquo;fierce wolves&rdquo; and from those who speak perverted things.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE SECRET OF SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>Sanctification is the third section of God&rsquo;s organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Three Aspects of God&rsquo;s Sanctification</h2><p>God&rsquo;s sanctification of the believers is of three aspects.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The First Aspect</h2><p>The first aspect is the seeking sanctification by the Holy Spirit with the enlightening Word initially (1 Pet. 1:2; Luke 15:8). First Peter 1:2 speaks of &ldquo;the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Here we have initial sanctification&mdash;the sanctification of the Spirit that comes before obedience to Christ and faith in His redemption, that is, before justification through Christ&rsquo;s redemption (Rom. 3:24). This aspect of sanctification is seen also in Luke 15:8. In Luke 15, a chapter on the salvation of the Triune God, the Son (the shepherd) seeks the lost sinner objectively, and the Spirit (the woman) seeks the lost sinner subjectively by working within the repenting sinner. In verse 8 the seeking Spirit is likened to a woman who lit a lamp, swept the house, and sought carefully until she found the lost coin. This signifies the initial sanctification by the Holy Spirit.</p>
