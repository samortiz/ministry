<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWELVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DIVINE ECONOMY<br>IN CHRIST BAPTIZING ALL<br>THE BELIEVERS IN THE SPIRIT<br>INTO ONE BODY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Luke 24:49; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; 11:15, 16; 1 Cor. 12:13, 7-10, 28-31; 14:4-6, 19-25; 3:16; 6:19, 17; 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 3:3, 6, 17, 18; Rev. 1:4</H1><P>In the New Testament two aspects of the Spirit are revealed&#151;the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power. The Spirit of life is within us, while the Spirit of power is outside of us. The Spirit of life is essential, and the Spirit of power is economical. Anything that is economical is not as crucial as something which is essential. The Spirit of life comes to us and reaches and enters into us as the divine essence to constitute us into something divine. However, the Spirit of power is not related to the divine essence but to the economy. Many New Testament readers and teachers have not been clear concerning the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit, and the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO LINES AND TWO PROMISES</H2><P>Concerning the Spirit, in the New Testament there is the line of life and the line of power. In the Gospel of John there is the Spirit of life (6:63; 20:22), and in Paul's Epistles there are many references to the Spirit of life. In Romans 8:2 Paul used the term "the Spirit of life," and in 2 Corinthians 3:6 he says, "the Spirit gives life." However, in the writings of Luke there is another line. Luke 24:49 says, "And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high." Here the power refers to the power of the Spirit. This is not something inside but outside of us. Luke even illustrates that the Spirit of power is like an article of clothing. Clothing is put upon us for a certain purpose. A policeman's uniform is his clothing. While he is on duty, he must have his uniform. Without such a uniform, the policeman has no authority. Medical doctors likewise put on their white coats. The Spirit of power is likened to a uniform to cover us that we may function. Acts is the continuation of Luke's writing. In Acts 1:5 the Lord Jesus said, "You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit." This was to receive the power from on high (v. 8).</P><P>The line of life is within; the line of power is without. In John 14:16-17 the Lord Jesus told His disciples, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality." This is the promise given by the Lord Jesus concerning the coming of the Spirit. This promise is not concerning the Spirit of power, but the Spirit of life, and was fulfilled on the day of resurrection in John 20. On the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the day of resurrection, there was the fulfillment of another promise, the promise in Joel 2:28-32 (Acts 2:16-21). This was referred to by the Lord Jesus in Luke 24:49. The fulfillment in Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost was the fulfillment of God the Father's promise in the Old Testament. In Joel 2 the promise of God the Father was concerning the Spirit as power to enable people to prophesy, to see visions, and to dream dreams. This has nothing to do with life.</P>
