   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We may also say that the Father is the Son and that the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Isaiah 9:6 the Son is called the everlasting Father, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, the Father is the Son, and the Son is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The three of the Godhead are distinct, yet they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 1:1 says that the Word was with God and that the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, the Word and God are distinct, and on the other hand, they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit, but it also refers to the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the Lord and the Spirit are one, but on the other hand, they are distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we have to ask why God needs to be triune.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To answer this we need to know the whole Bible in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God needs to be triune because He desires to work Himself into us, to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Dispensation is the noun form of the verb dispense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's dispensation is His plan to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's dispensation, His economy, is to dispense Himself into us, to apply Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let us take electricity as an illustration of God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The current of electricity and electricity itself are not two separate matters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The current of electricity is the electricity itself in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When electricity moves, when it flows, there is the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need the current of electricity for the application of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we never applied electricity, there would be no need for us to have the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we are going to dispense electricity into our homes, we need the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The current of electricity is for the dispensation, the economy, of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the New Testament Jesus told us that He, as the Son, was sent by the Father John 5:37; 8:18, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His being sent by the Father indicates that the Father is the source, out of which the Son flowed to be among mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that the Son and the Father were two separate divine beings substantially.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are substantially one divine Being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father is the source, and the Son is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the Son as the expression of the Father could only come to be among mankind; He could not come into man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In John 14 the Lord Jesus indicated that He needed to change form from the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He indicated that He had to pass through death and enter into resurrection so that He could come into us as the Spirit, as the breath vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After His death and resurrection, He came back as the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the evening on the day of resurrection He came to the disciples, breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Breath" 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the breath, He got into the disciples, so God was dispensed into human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the divine Trinity is for God's dispensation to dispense God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit is the final person of God's dispensation and of God's visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How could God come to us?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How could God visit us?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He comes to us and visits us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Electricity comes into a room as the current.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is no current of electricity, the electricity cannot be dispensed into the room and be applied to it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Electricity is applied to us in current.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, current is the visitation of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In like manner, the Spirit is the visitation of God, the dispensing of God, the application of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The third person of the Godhead, who is the Spirit, is the application of God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If God is going to be applied to us, He needs to be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The essence of God needs the application of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The essence of a certain medicine needs to be put in the form of a pill so it can be dispensed into a sick patient.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The pill is for the application of the medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, the Spirit as the third person of the Godhead is for God's application of His essence to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we want to see the third aspect of the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The first aspect is that God is Spirit in essence, and the second aspect is that God in His Trinity is the Spirit for application.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The third aspect of the divine Spirit can be seen in 1 Corinthians 15:45, which tells us that the last Adam, who was Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Redeemer, the Savior, who passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The third aspect of the divine Spirit is the aspect of life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The essence is for the application, and the application is for life-giving.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord wants to apply Himself into us to give us life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Word Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The fourth aspect of the divine Spirit is that the words the Lord speaks to us are spirit John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God is Spirit, the third person of the Godhead is Spirit, Christ was made a life-giving Spirit, and the divine word is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is one Spirit in four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first aspect is the essence, the second is the application, the third is the life-giving, and the fourth is the word for feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>John 6 tells us that Christ is the bread of life to feed us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>35, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need the essence and the application for life-giving, and this life-giving mostly depends upon feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord feeds us with Himself as the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Spirit is living and real but rather abstract, mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the words are substantial and concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is the Spirit that gives life, and today the Spirit is embodied in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Spirit today is consolidated into the word, the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Words in Greek in John 6:63 is not logos but rhema the instant, living, present, up-to-date word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT FOR THE DISPENSING OF GOD INTO US AS OUR LIFE AND LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The four aspects of the divine Spirit that we have seen are for one purpose to dispense God into us as our life and as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God Himself is Spirit essentially, the last person of the Godhead is the Spirit economically, Christ is the Spirit all-inclusively, and the words that He speaks are the Spirit practically for the one purpose of giving us life and feeding us with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These four aspects are like four steps that God takes to dispense Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Spirit of life includes God as Spirit, includes the third person of God's Trinity, includes the all-inclusive, redeeming Christ with His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and includes the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All that God is to us is the all-inclusive Spirit, which is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This Spirit gives us life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As a help in realizing the all-inclusiveness of the Spirit of life, I would encourage you to read the booklet entitled The All-Inclusive Spirit of Christ published by Living Stream Ministry.</S>
