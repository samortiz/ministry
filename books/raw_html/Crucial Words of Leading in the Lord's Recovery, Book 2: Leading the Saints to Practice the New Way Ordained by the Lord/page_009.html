 <h2 class="head2">Laboring in Word and Teaching</h2>
<p>The elders should not only be apt to teach; they must also labor in word and teaching (1 Tim. 5:17b). There are two aspects in regard to laboring in the word: on one hand, you need to learn; on the other hand, you need to teach. A person who teaches at school, whether as a university professor or as an elementary school teacher, knows that when he was a student, his learning was limited because he did not need to teach others. Since becoming a teacher, he needs to study, learn thoroughly, and be well prepared. For instance, if he needs to teach a class tomorrow, he will need to review and study today. He will also have to decide what to teach first and what to teach later. As a result, his teaching will be systematic and effective; otherwise, his teaching will be disorderly. Hence, teaching requires labor.</p>
<p>A person who has not labored should not expect to know anything concerning the truth, let alone teach others. One who knows the truth and can teach others must have labored in word and teaching. Many who work for the Lord can testify that the most painful thing in the service is to release a message. One who speaks for the Lord often needs to rest for two hours after speaking a message in order to recover. This is because speaking is strenuous, consuming both mind and energy; it is most laborious but most effective.</p>
<p>If the parents do not know how to teach their children, the children will certainly suffer in their education. When they make mistakes, the parents should not immediately become angry at them; rather, the parents need to explain the matter and instruct their children unceasingly. This way of teaching is certainly beneficial. This is the same in the church. As long as the elders take the lead well, are apt to teach, and labor in word and teaching, the church will surely be strong and rich, and the result will also be rich.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Heed to Shepherd</h2>
<p>The elders need to not only teach but also shepherd people. To shepherd people is to nourish people, to render some supply, to cherish them, and to help them and teach them to solve their problems (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Lording It over Others<br />
but Becoming Patterns to Them</h2>
<p>As elders, we should not lord it over others and give them the feeling that because we are elders, they must obey what we say as if we were kings. This is absolutely not acceptable. First Peter 5:3 says that an elder should be a pattern. In the church there are some who may not want to read the Bible. The elders should not blame them; rather, they should first ask whether they themselves read the Bible. If the elders read and enter into the Bible, the saints will be able to tell and will follow the elders in reading and entering into it. Hence, it is a matter of being a pattern. We should not lord it over others; instead, we should be the head sheep, the patterns, among the flock. Only this way is proper.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ASPIRE TO THE OVERSEERSHIP<br />
DESIRING A GOOD WORK</h2>
<p>The last point is an encouragement to all the elders, which is that those who aspire to the overseership desire a good work. In this regard, there is a need for some explanation. Everyone within any group has ambition and the desire to have a position to take the lead. If this is the case among us, it is not right. If some, however, desire to serve as elders for the building up of the local churches and for the benefit of God&rsquo;s children and desire to truly have this kind of function and capacity, then their desire is not merely a matter of position but of function. Those who desire this function are approved and praiseworthy. Paul says that they desire a good work (1 Tim. 3:1).</p>
<p>I hope that the Lord will speak to each one of us so that we may see that the most necessary and crucial persons in God&rsquo;s economy on the earth today are the elders. This is not just a matter of position or reputation but of bearing an important responsibility. Such a responsibility requires that the elders bear all the brothers and sisters on their shoulders, embrace them with their hearts, and bring them before God in order to &ldquo;read&rdquo; them and seek God&rsquo;s leading for them. They then need to be the head sheep, the leading ones, the patterns among saints. Moreover, they need to teach the saints, spend much time learning and teaching the truth of God, and labor in teaching. In this way, all the churches will be strong and rich over the long term.</p>
<p>The church can hardly become rich and strong if there is no teaching or leading from the elders and if the church relies only on special fellowships or conferences given by a few full-time serving ones every few months. This may be compared to opening a school. A school can be successful if it formally divides up the classes and hires teachers to teach systematically day after day. The school may at times invite some renowned person to give a speech, but such activities, though helpful, are not the main reason for a school&rsquo;s success. If a school has a good curriculum and the teachers are serious in their teaching, the school will still be strong and successful, even if no one of renown ever gives a speech to the students.</p>
<p>We do not need much help from the outside because we have the Bible, a Bible that has been opened to us, and many spiritual publications. As long as we spend the time, we will be able to enter into all these riches. Furthermore, we can practice and learn to speak for the Lord. As long as we practice and continue to labor in teaching and leading, the church will surely grow.</p>
<p>In regard to the number of those attending the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting, we have not experienced much increase for the past twenty years. On one hand, we thank the Lord for His preservation, yet on the other hand, we should not be satisfied. Twenty years is not a short period of time, yet we have not had much progress or propagation. This is our responsibility, and we are all accountable.</p>
