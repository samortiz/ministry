 <h2 class="head1">PROMOTING THE STUDY OF THE LIFE-STUDIES<br />
TO BRING IN A GENUINE REVIVAL<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>We should have a burden to promote the life-studies continent by continent until every household has the life-studies, and every saint has the life-studies both inwardly and outwardly. The life-studies are for teaching and helping people to read the Bible. When you read the Bible, your mind may not be enlightened even after reading it a hundred times. However, when you open the Recovery Version of the New Testament, there are footnotes that open the truth to you in the places you cannot understand. Once the word of the truth is opened, you will receive the revelation. Then when you read the life-studies, you will be enlightened even more. After you have read the life-studies, the few verses you have studied will be fully opened to you. Ephesians has only six chapters, but there are ninety-seven messages in the <em>Life-study of Ephesians.</em> If you read two messages a day, you will need about fifty days to finish it. After you have spent fifty days to read through all these ninety-seven messages, the content of the six chapters, the entire book of Ephesians, every sentence, and even every word will be clear and enlightening to you. In other words, Ephesians, this mysterious and marvelous book, will be fully opened to you.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">OPENING THE SAINTS&rsquo; HOMES BY<br />
ESTABLISHING AND LEADING THE GROUP MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Now, based on the information that we have received concerning the saints, we should form groups of twelve and have the full-timers help the saints, not to have a Sunday service or to form a small meeting with them, but to study the truth of the Bible together. Moreover, we also have to pour out our love. If the small group is meeting at your home, you should prepare the best refreshments for them. Do not love your money, but release your money to prepare the best refreshments. I believe that those saints who do not meet regularly will be enlivened by eating these refreshments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we go to establish and lead the small groups, we should not go to the husbands first, because they are harder to deal with. Rather, we should first go to the wives, because they are usually softer and more cooperative. In many of the saved families, the husbands usually are not willing to open their homes at the beginning. However, the wives are willing, and in the end the wives influence their husbands to open their homes for the small group. Therefore, we have to contact the sisters first. Once you set them on fire, they will be burning. Then let the sisters influence their husbands. In this way the saints will open their homes one by one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SETTING THE SAINTS ON FIRE<br />
THROUGH THE OPENING OF THE HOMES<br />
FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The fourth pillar in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the gospel. Every saint should open his home for the preaching of the gospel. When we go to help the saints to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel, we should not replace them. Rather, we should perfect them and let them speak and preach the gospel. They may decline and say that they do not have the gift and that they do not know how to speak. At that time we have to help them. We should first speak to them and then let them speak accordingly. Experience tells us that it is through this kind of speaking that their inner being becomes burning, and the meeting becomes even more burning. Hence, the best way to recover the saints who have not met for a long time is to strongly encourage them to preach the gospel and to help them to speak the Lord&rsquo;s word to others. Once they begin speaking, their inner being will be burning.</p>
<p>We all have had the same experience. When we preach the gospel to people, our inner being is set on fire. Some people are cold inwardly because they do not speak for the Lord or preach the gospel. As long as we are willing to stand up to speak for the Lord, no matter what we speak or how we speak, we will be enlivened and even set on fire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING APOSTLES, PROPHETS, AND TEACHERS THROUGH THE SMALL GROUPS</h2>
<p>We encourage the saints to form the small groups with twelve people in each group. This is based on the Scriptures. The first small group in church history comprised the twelve apostles appointed by the Lord Jesus. It was the first small group since the dawn of history. Today we are following the pattern of the Lord Jesus to establish the saints as groups of &ldquo;twelve apostles&rdquo; so that the churches will be full of &ldquo;apostles.&rdquo; First Corinthians 12:28 says, &ldquo;And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers.&rdquo; If we are faithful, all the saints in our locality will be apostles, prophets, and teachers in five years. Every small group will have twelve apostles, prophets, and teachers. Some people may ask, &ldquo;Who would dare to say that he is an apostle?&rdquo; As long as we are sent by the Lord to speak for Him and preach the gospel to our parents, relatives, friends, and neighbors, we are apostles. If we can speak more, we will become prophets. Prophets do not necessarily speak prophecies; they are those who speak for the Lord Jesus and speak Him forth. Then, we also have to teach people; in this way, we will become teachers. First, we become apostles, then prophets, and lastly, teachers. If all the saints are like this, the churches will be strong and flourishing, full of apostles, prophets, and teachers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH, LIFE, THE CHURCH, AND THE GOSPEL BEING OUR PRESENT URGENT NEEDS</h2>
<p>However, if we all have the desire to be apostles, prophets, and teachers, we must first learn the truth. If what we speak is the truth, the work of the Holy Spirit will follow our speaking. Then the words that we speak will touch our parents and friends, and they will believe and receive. After they have believed, we have to speak the deeper truths to them. Then we will become prophets, and they will know the Lord more. If we continue to speak to them for two to three years, we will become teachers, and eventually they will all know the Lord and will also speak to others. If the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are full of this kind of speaking and teaching, the churches will be stronger and richer and will bring forth the multiplication and increase.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need the truth, life, the church, and the preaching of the gospel. We also need for everyone to rise up to be an apostle, a prophet, and a teacher. In this way the church will be strong, rich, and victorious. May God bless us in receiving such a word.</p>
