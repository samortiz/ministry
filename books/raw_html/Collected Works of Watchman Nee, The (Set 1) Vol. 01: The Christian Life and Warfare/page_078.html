<P CLASS=CENTER>_______</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>Brief Hints on the</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRINCIPLES OF WARFARE.</H2><P>The whole armour on. (Ephes. vi. 10-18.)</P><P>Knowing how to watch. (Matt. xxvi. 41.)</P><P>Knowing how to DEFEND, as well as how to ATTACK: to (1) stand, (2) withstand, and (3) resist.</P><P>Fight (or pray) from principle—in cold blood, and irrespective of an apparent flow, because opposition of Powers of Darkness may account for lack of flow.</P><P>A need seen is a call to prayer; we must not wait for burdens or feelings, or we may get spurious ones. </P><P>KNOWLEDGE GOVERNS PRAYER (1 Cor. xiv. 15). Lack of knowledge means unintelligent and less effectual warfare. If there is no knowledge prayer must be made for knowledge, (or more knowledge, as the case may be).</P><P>As the warfare means great strains at times, these must be protective prayer, asking for (1) strength, (2) vision (not visions), and (3) knowledge; all for prayer.</P><P>Recognize that there is a difference between Satan and his works, temptations and wiles, the strong man and his goods, and deal with each as such.</P><P>Guard against indirect attacks of Satan—often the most violent, and often through your nearest and dearest.</P><P>Guard against (1) wrong motives, (2) indefinite prayer, (3) spasmodic prayer, (4) anxiety in prayer, (5) impatience in prayer, (6) being over-burdened in prayer (gauge your capacity), (7) fainting by the way, (8) false fighting (evil burdens, wasting strength), (9) wrong use of weapons, (10) misjudging by appearances.</P><P>We must be willing to pay the price of victory in the deliverance of others; have no preconceptions as to how God will work; watch every opportunity to co-operate with God as a means of answering our prayers; and walk softly, for great victory is a time of great danger, as the devil is then scheming to rob you of your victory.</P><P>* Neither time, place nor season are exempt from the attacks of Satan and his host—which, in itself, is a call to arms.</P><P CLASS=CENTER>_______</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>METHODS OF WARFARE.</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1> "First bind...then spoil..."</H2><P>Briefly: "BINDING" THE ENEMY SIMPLY MEANS STOPPING HIM FROM ACTING, THEN DESTROYING HIS WORKS.</P><P>Prayer must, therefore, be (1) destructive, (2) constructive.</P><P>Wield (1) the AUTHORITY of the NAME (Mark xvi. 17); (2) the BLOOD of the Lamb; and (3) the TESTIMONY against Satan (Rev. xii. 11), that he is conquered and must withdraw.</P><P>God's WORD must be stored in the heart. The WORD is the sword (Ephes. vi. 17), and we must become skilled to know which Scripture to use in meeting the particular assaults of the enemy, and in attacking his strongholds.</P><P>Joined to the Risen Lord we may bring into operation through prayer, the curse pronounced upon the serpent in Eden. —All on the ground of Calvary where Christ "flung off principalities and powers...triumphing over them" (Col. ii. 15).</P><P>There is the prayer of asking (John xiv. 13); interceding (Rom. viii. 26); saying (Matt. xxi. 21; Mark xi. 23-25).</P><P>Pray progressively as from the centre of a circle. Thus: 1, personal; 2, family; 3, circumstances; 4, business; 5, local; 6, world-wide (church, and the world).—All the time in each sphere against ALL the powers of darkness.</P><P>PRAY against Satan as: Liar (John viii. 44); Counterfeiter (2 Cor. xi. 14); Hinderer (1 Thes. ii. 18); Murderer (John viii. 44).</P><P>PRAY against (1) the plans of Satan, (2) the schemes of Satan and evil spirits, to prevent those in formation from materialising, and to destroy the effect of those in operation.</P><P>Stand, joined to the Risen Christ, and say: "I stand against all the wiles of the devil. I stand in every avenue of the enemy's approach—known or unknown." Then watch and what you do as an act of faith in bulk you will do in detail.</P><P>Pray against Satan holding the mind, affections, and will; and on the ground of Calvary, in the Spirit, claim the binding of the strong man; e.g., Pray: "I now claim that the strong man shall be bound on the ground of the precious BLOOD, and in the NAME of JESUS; I refuse all his plans, and may they all be destroyed."</P><P>AUDIBLE prayer is often an effectual weapon to victory.</P><P>Preaching the word with AUTHORITY, in the power and demonstration of the Spirit, is also a mighty factor in the binding of the strong man and the spoiling of his goods—co-operative with prayer.</P><P>* There are degrees of victory. All prayer counts in the fight. To whatever measure these principles and methods are applied, according to the capacity of the believer, TO THAT DEGREE THERE WILL BE VICTORY.</P>
