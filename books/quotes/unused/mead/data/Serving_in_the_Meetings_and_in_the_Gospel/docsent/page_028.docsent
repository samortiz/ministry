   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEARING FRUIT IN A DETAILED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we saw in the previous message, there are at least ten ways to speak to people about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are the ways of:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1 sin, 2 the result of sin, 3 the vanity of human life, 4 God, 5 the love of God, 6 Christ, 7 the redemption of Christ, 8 life, 9 repentance by faith, and 10 salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These points are easy if we consider their order.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are sinful, and with sin there is an issue, a consequence, a result.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Human life is vain and empty, but we have God, His love, and His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of the redemption of Christ through the cross, we have life, which we receive through repentance by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The result of repentance by faith is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to use these ten points to attack people with the gospel; we must be an army to defeat Satan by hitting people s weak point.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to learn these things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not too hard; rather, it is easy if we practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I beg you to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, it will be difficult to have the real increase.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gospel must be preached in this way by the living members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not depend much on the so-called great evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must depend on the members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fruit spoken of by the Lord in John 15, that is brought forth by the branches of the vine, are the souls saved through us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the branches of the vine, we must bear fruit; that is, we must produce new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a general way we need to abide in Christ to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in a detailed way we need to pray, claim the power from on high, learn to speak to people in a living way, not merely according to our memory, and learn to use the Lord s word in a living, practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then it will be very easy to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We will be the branches bearing fruit all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I expect that in one year we will see the number among us increase.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, there must be something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be sure, this will mean that we are wrong in certain aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To not be fruitful means that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>OUR NEED FOR TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we take this word merely as a message, it will not and cannot help us much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a training to instruct us how to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not practice, this word will mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if we do practice it, we will appreciate this training more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When many saints in the Far East first came to be trained, they asked me not to be very strict with them, but after ten years they said that I had not been strict enough.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have learned these matters, and in this way I have come to know that we need training.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul told Timothy, For bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of that which is to come 1 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to exercise in the spiritual things and learn to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE NEED FOR HUMAN COOPERATION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Christians today are superstitious, saying, Everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord will do it all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything is not all right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have our part and must take care of our obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to cooperate with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The principle of the New Testament is that the Lord never does things by Himself; rather, He always does things with us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He needs the human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do not cooperate, He cannot do what He wants.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said the gospel would be preached to the uttermost part of the earth, but almost two thousand years have passed, and this word is still not fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is He not able?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is more than able, but He has delayed for this long because the New Testament principle is that He needs human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By Himself in His old creation He said, Let there be light, and there was light, but in His new creation He needs human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He Himself needed to be incarnated, to put on the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whatever Christ did, He did it in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reason the Lord has delayed so long is that it is very hard for Him to have the human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How much He will do and can do depends on how much cooperation we render to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be sure, if we render Him more and more cooperation, He will do more.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today the secret is not with the Lord; it is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to bear our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>With Him there is no problem, but we may not be ready.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, we have to practice and give Him the adequate human cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then He will work.</S>
