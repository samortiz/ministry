   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The last Adam, Christ, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that it was in resurrection that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit by the fact that the entire chapter of 1 Corinthians 15 is on resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The context of this chapter proves that it was in resurrection that Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 14:16 and 17 the Lord Jesus speaks of another Comforter, even the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word another indicates that the Lord, the One speaking, is a Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If He were not a Comforter, then He would not have said that He would ask the Father to send another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we read John 14:16-20 carefully, we shall see that, eventually, the second Comforter is actually the first Comforter as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 17 the Lord says that the Spirit of reality will be in the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then in verse 18 He continues, I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The He who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 now becomes the I, the Lord Himself, in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that after His resurrection the Lord would become the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, the Lord speaks of another Comforter in verse 16 and then says in verse 20, In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the Lord again reveals that He Himself would be in the disciples as the Spirit, as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ became the Spirit through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the day of His resurrection Christ breathed into His disciples and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may say that Christ already was the Spirit when He was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The difference here is that His flesh was a covering comparable to a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Through death and resurrection the opaque shell of the flesh became transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, now we can see that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through death and resurrection the last Adam in the opaque shell of the flesh became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is still the same Jesus, but now the shell is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The One who was with the disciples is the same One who is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ s resurrection includes the fact that He, the last Adam, the One who is the Lamb of God, the Redeemer, has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit are precious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For our enjoyment we need the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We treasure both the Redeemer and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In death the Lord Jesus was the Lamb, the Redeemer, and in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In resurrection Christ comes to us as the Spirit, as the pneumatic Christ John 20:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only has Christ become the life-giving Spirit, but when He comes to us, He comes as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He comes as the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus came to His disciples as the pneumatic Christ on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In chapter twenty of the Gospel of John, the Lord came to His disciples, who were in a place where the doors were shut, as the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word pneuma means spirit; it also means breath or air.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 1 Christ is the Lamb, but in John 20, after His death and in His resurrection, He is the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first time He came, He came as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The second time He came as the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to John 20:22, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that the Lord came to the disciples as breath.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we receive Christ today, we receive the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we receive not only the redeeming Christ but also the life-giving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Day by day we are enjoying not only the redeeming Christ but also the life-giving Christ, the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To say that Christ is the pneumatic Christ means that He is full of divine breath.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Just as a car tire must be pneumatic, that is, full of air, so every Christian should be pneumatic, full of heavenly breath.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our daily life we should not be flat, short of divine breath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our spiritual breath is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In resurrection Christ has come to us as this Spirit, the pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord became the pneumatic Christ through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now in resurrection our Christ, the Redeemer, is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
