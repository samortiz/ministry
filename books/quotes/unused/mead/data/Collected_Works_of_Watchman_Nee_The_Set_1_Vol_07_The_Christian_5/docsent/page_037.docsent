   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Questions which are not edifying will not be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Unprofitable questions will not be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE RIGHTEOUS AS SHEEP IN THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Question: Matthew 25:31 to the end speaks of all nations being judged on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 37, it refers to the righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who are these righteous ones?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chang, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Answer: These righteous ones are, of course, different from us today who have become righteous by believing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By that time, the Lord Jesus will have already come to earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, it will be a period of time after the seven years and before the thousand years; the age of grace will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God will deal with the world in the same way that He dealt with Israel in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The righteousness here, therefore, does not refer to our present righteousness, which is obtained by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord calls them the righteous because they have treated the Jews "one of these, the least of My brothers" kindly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their being called righteous is to differentiate them from the cursed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The principle of this judgment follows Genesis 12:3, 27:29, and Numbers 24:5, 9, and 14.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please read Psalm 37:10-11 and 21-22 and compare with Matthew 5:5.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>WOMEN TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Question: In 1 Corinthians 14:34 and the verses after that, and in 1 Timothy 2:12, Paul says that the women are not permitted to speak or to teach in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Should women be permitted to teach in the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Chang, Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Answer: The Bible says they should not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>JOHN THE BAPTIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Question: Before John the Baptist was born, he leaped in his mother's womb when his mother saw Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He later proclaimed many times that the Lord Jesus was the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord Jesus was baptized, John said that the heavens opened and the Spirit descended.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He even heard God's own testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If so, why would he not know who the Lord Jesus was?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why did he send his disciples when he was in prison to ask who the Lord Jesus was?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Kang, Honan</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Answer: This event was recorded in Matthew 11:1-19.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the answer given by the Lord Jesus, we know that the faith of John the Baptist was weakened at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The answer of the Lord is in verses 4 through 6.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the end of His answer, the Lord said, "And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For John to ask such a question meant that he was stumbled by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>John the Baptist was the forerunner of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was the last of the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Like all the other Old Testament prophets, he did not understand many of the things he preached.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was a Jew, and he could not help but be influenced by the hope of the Jews of that time, that the Messiah would be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, when he preached that the kingdom of the heavens was at hand, he thought that the Lord Jesus was going to be a physical king on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He had high hopes in the physical things, because he was the forerunner of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did not realize that the kingdom of the heavens has two stages: first the spiritual stage in which Christ was despised by the world and then the manifested stage at which time Christ will be honored and worshipped by the world .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Christ that he testified of was not what he hoped He would be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This Christ did not emerge to establish a manifested kingdom, but instead He traveled all over to preach and to heal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He acted as if He had no ambition to be a king!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the meantime, John was imprisoned, and his own life was in great danger!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As a result, his faith was shaken; he questioned whether the Lord Jesus was indeed the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If He was, why did He fail to match his expectation?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Often, we are the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He, therefore, sent his disciples to question the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In essence, the Lord gave His answer as follows: "You should know who I am from the things that I have said and done v. 4 . You should not be stumbled just because My works are lowly and do not match your expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Messiah must first suffer and then enter into His glory."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May our hearts not be stumbled because Christ was despised.</S>
