<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. God Having Regenerated Us<br>through the Resurrection of Christ</H2><P>God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ (1 Pet. 1:3), and now He renews us, transforms us, and conforms us to His image of glory, and ultimately He will glorify us in His glory (Titus 3:5; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23; 2 Cor. 4:16; 3:18; Rom. 8:29-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. God Consuming Us,<br>Putting Us into Christ's Death<br>for Our Fellowship of His Sufferings</H2><P>In His renewing and transforming, God consumes us, putting us into Christ's death for our fellowship of His sufferings, which work out for us an eternal weight of glory, that we may experience Him in His resurrection and gain Him in His unsearchable riches (2 Cor. 4:16-17, 10; Phil. 3:10, 8; Eph. 3:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. God the Father<br>Being Embodied in God the Son,<br>God the Son<br>Being Realized as God the Spirit,<br>and God the Spirit Coming<br>to Indwell Us to Be the Reality of the Triune God</H2><P>John 14:16-20 reveals that God the Father is embodied in God the Son, that God the Son is realized as God the Spirit, and that God the Spirit comes to indwell us to be the reality of the Triune God. This is the gift that God intended to give Job, that is, Himself in His Divine Trinity embodied in the Son and realized as the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. The Spirit of Reality<br>Revealing Many Things to the Believers<br>concerning the Mystery of the Triune God<br>Being the Reality in the Believers</H2><P>Concerning the mystery of the Triune God being the reality in the believers, Christ had many things to tell His disciples, but they could not bear them until the Spirit of reality came to reveal these things to them (John 16:12-15). This was done by the Spirit of reality mainly with the apostle Paul, who completed the word of God, that is, the divine revelation (Col. 1:25-27) regarding Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2b) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4).</P>
