It divided believers into three classes: Those who are being rewarded, those who will not be rewarded, and those who will be punished. I really admire your explanations, which are all according to the Bible. According to the above explanation, what would you say about Judas Iscariot, about Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5, and about Simon the sorcerer in chapter eight? Please instruct me in detail. (Yang, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: With regard to Judas Iscariot, it should not be hard after hearing the Lord's words for one to see his outcome. He was the "son of perdition" (John 17:12). As for Ananias and Sapphira, if they were among "the multitude of those who had believed" (Acts 4:32), even though they were delivered to Satan for the destruction of their flesh, yet this was for the purpose that their spirit would be saved in the day of the Lord (1 Cor. 5:5). Simon was a saved person. In Acts 8:13 it says, "And even Simon himself believed, and...he had been baptized"; Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved." One thing is most important: We ourselves should believe in the Lord and be saved. For those who are still living on this earth and are not yet saved, we should do our best to preach the gospel to them, so that they would believe and be saved. As for the dead ones, whether or not they are saved is in God's hand; we should not worry about them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DELIVERED TO SATAN</H2><P>Question: Every time I read 1 Corinthians 5:5, there are always doubts arising in my heart. Since the word says to "deliver such a one to Satan," how can he also be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus? Please tell me, in what way is one delivered unto Satan? (Chang, Ningpo)</P><P>Answer: Please forgive me for not answering your question until this issue! The one who was to be delivered to Satan and whom the apostle spoke about here was the believer who had committed adultery. He was a "brother" already (v. 11). Hence, he was saved and one who belonged to the Lord. Again, if we look at the words in verses 7 and 8, we know that this man already had Jesus Christ as the Passover Lamb, but he did not keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Because he trusted in the precious blood, he was saved. The problem was that he had not purged his sins. Once a person is saved, he is saved forever. The apostle had only delivered his body to Satan; his spirit and soul still belong to the Lord. The body of the believers should be under God's protection. Satan always loves to murder the believers, but God's hand is always restricting Satan. However, when God's hand is removed, Satan will immediately do his work (cf. the story of Job). Therefore, the delivering of this one to Satan was the removing of God's hand; God no longer restricted Satan from working on him. This man would suffer the destruction by Satan to his flesh. He would even die, as a warning for him. A sinner finds pleasure in his flesh. Hence, his flesh should suffer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTIZE INTO WHAT NAME</H2><P>Question: I have read the testimony of Mrs. Y. R. in your magazine, but I still have some questions. Please instruct me in the love of the Lord. In Matthew 3:13 the baptism the Lord Jesus received from John was by water (it did not mention in whose name). In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus commanded the disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. In Acts 19 the Ephesians had received the baptism of John (by immersion); in verse 5, they were baptized again (by immersion?), but there Paul only baptized them in the name of the Lord (different from the command given by the Lord Jesus). Apparently, the apostles could baptize people in the name of the Lord Jesus alone. In Acts 9 Ananias of Damascus was a disciple. He baptized Paul in the name of the Lord only. If we read Acts carefully, we see that everyone was baptized only in the name of the Lord. What then is the baptism we now receive? Whose baptism is it? Is it John's baptism, or the Lord Jesus' baptism, or both? Do those who baptize people do so in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, or in the name of the Lord Jesus only? Or are both permissible? (Lee, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: The baptism we now receive is not the baptism of John because although John was "the lamp that was burning and shining," people rejoiced only "for a while in his light" (John 5:35). Acts 19 is sufficient to prove this point. The Bible does not say whose baptism we are now receiving. Romans 6 merely states that we are baptized into the Lord's death. Matthew 28:19 says that we are baptized "into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." We see that those who care much about rituals merely recite this phrase when they baptize people! Actually, this is not a ceremony, but the declaration of a fact. It is a pity that this line is used by the denominations as a litany of baptism, a line which one reads at the time of baptism. When we read the acts of the apostles in Acts (8:16; 10:48; 19:5), we find further proof of what we have said. In the Bible, there is not one record of men being baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, every time Acts mentions the name, it is always the name of the Lord Jesus. However, this does not mean that the matter should be practiced ritualistically, in the way that men today are doing. The reason for this is that sometimes the Bible also mentions the name of "the Lord Jesus" (8:16; 19:5) and also the name of "Jesus Christ" (2:38; 10:48). Therefore, baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus, and a person is baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 07: The Christian (5) &nbsp; pg 63</div><br></body></html>
