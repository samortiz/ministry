   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this series of messages we shall consider the factors which are vital to the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The New Testament reveals to us that God has an eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s eternal purpose is to have the church for the expression of Himself in Christ Eph 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, the church is the central revelation of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Ephesians 5:25 tells us that the Lord Jesus died for the church, and Matthew 16:18 tells us that He is now building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church is the main subject of all the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The last book of the New Testament, the book of Revelation, reveals to us the local churches in many localities Rev 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today in the Lord s recovery the main item to be recovered is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, it is crucial that we see the factors that are vital to the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this chapter and in the following five chapters we shall cover six factors which are vital for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first three form a group consisting of Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life are the basic and crucial factors of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are going to fulfill the desire of God s heart, surely we must practice the church life; and for us to practice the church life, we all need to see Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the focus of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning Christ, the Bible reveals to us two main things: His Person and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible first tells us who Christ is and what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It then goes on to tell us what Christ has done, what He is still doing, and what He will do in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The revelation of Christ s Person and work in the Bible is exceedingly rich and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this message we shall consider six main items concerning the Person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>CHRIST BEING JEHOVAH, THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first item concerning Christ s Person is that He is the very Jehovah, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This fact is revealed in Exodus chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Exodus 3 we are told that when God came to call Moses, He appeared to him in a burning bush as the angel of Jehovah v. 2 . The angel of Jehovah denotes the one sent by Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, in Exodus 3 the angel of Jehovah was actually Jehovah God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Exodus 3:3-4, when Moses turned to see the burning bush, it was Jehovah God who called to him out of the midst of the bush.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then God told Moses, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob v. 6 . The fact that God is the God of three generations indicates that He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 13 Moses went on to ask God what His name is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God answered that His name is Jehovah vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The divine title Jehovah in the ancient Hebrew language literally means to be, or to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s name is simply To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that everything will cease to be, but God will ever continue to be.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is the great To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Most English translations of Exodus 3:14 render this title I AM THAT I AM.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this verse God told Moses that His name is I AM THAT I AM.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This name implies that He is the One who exists, the One who is, the One who remains, and the One who is everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 8 the Lord Jesus used the name I Am in reference to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 24 He told the Pharisees, Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Pharisees knew that the name I Am referred to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was the reason that they condemned the Lord Jesus, saying that He blasphemed God by considering Himself the same as Jehovah John 10:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yes, Jesus is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The name Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Joshua Num 13:16 , which means Jehovah the Savior, or the salvation of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus is the One who is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nothing is but Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not think that I am something, for I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You also are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are all nothing, but Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is life John 14:6 , He is light John 8:12 , He is love 1 John 4:16 , and He is grace John 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the real food John 6:51 , He is the real water John 7:37-39 , and He is even the door John 10:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jesus is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The divine title To Be implies that He is the self-existing and ever-existing One.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word self-existing refers to something which exists of or by itself without beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is self-existing, having no beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The word ever-existing refers to something which exists forever, without ending.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior, is the very To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He exists by Himself without beginning, and He exists forever without ending.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, this self-existing and ever-existing One is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Exodus 3:6 God told Moses that He is the God of Abraham the father, the God of Isaac the son, and the God of Jacob the grandson.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fact that He is the God of three generations, not of one, two, or four generations, implies that He is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is the unique God, yet He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He is the Father in His relationship to Abraham the father; He is the Son in His relationship to Isaac the son; and He is the Spirit in His relationship to Jacob the grandson.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here we can see the Triune God applied to three generations; yet He is still one God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This great To Be, this self-existing and ever-existing Jehovah, the Triune God, was the very One sent by God to call Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As the sent One He was the angel of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is both the Sender and the sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This same One was sent again in the New Testament to call us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the Gospel of John, Jesus told us many times that the Father sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was the One sent by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The sent one is simply the angel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the New Testament the angel of Jehovah is Jesus, and Jesus is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is the very Jehovah, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Jesus is the very embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He is nothing less than the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul says in Romans 9:5 that Christ...is over all, God blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our God is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Jesus, our Redeemer and our Savior, is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should not think that Jesus and God are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No, our Jesus is our God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In his Epistles to Timothy and Titus, Paul uses the titles our Savior God 1 Tim 2:3; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4 , our Savior Christ Jesus 2 Tim 1:10 , and Jesus Christ our Savior Titus 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Furthermore, in Titus 2:13 he refers to the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Paul s use of these divine titles is strong proof that Jesus is our Savior and our God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>A number of people who claim to be Christians do not believe and confess that Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many of these so-called Christians say that Jesus was a great man, and that because of this people worship Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Surely we must reject this as heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Jesus is God!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He is the self-existing and ever-existing God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is the eternal God, and He is the complete God the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is nothing less than the very God, the God who is one yet three triune.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We all must declare that our God is Jesus.</S>
