   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDIX FOUR IDENTIFYING HERESIES Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 11:13-15; 1 Tim 6:20-21; 2 Tim 4:3-4; 2 Pet 2:1; Jude 3; Isa 8:20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The following message was given by Watchman Nee in Kuling on September 28, 1948, as part of the New Believers series.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It was later excluded from the final published version of the series.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Heresy is a big subject.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should give new believers a proper understanding of the subject so that they can build up a proper defense against it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should read the verses above to new believers one by one, and then we should tell them that these verses show that many heretics will arise in the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These heretics come from within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some will use the name of Christ to propagate their heretical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every Christian should be warned concerning the matter of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jude 3 says that we have to earnestly contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be orthodox in our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must help the new believers to choose the proper path.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should warn them concerning heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have covered the subject of the pathway of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We said that only one church will keep the Lord s word and His name in the end times the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our eyes must be opened to find this church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NOT BECOMING CURIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many curious ones like to try different things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the end they become poisoned by what they try.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Curiosity brings nothing but poison to a person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s children do not need to become involved in a heresy, only to find out later that it is a heresy and then condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not need to be involved in heresy after heresy and condemn them one by one afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as we hear some strange thing, we should turn away from it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people like to try things out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the end they fall into the very things they are trying.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are stumbled by them and cannot get out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should never be curious, lest we fall into heresies and become trapped by them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No heresy is one hundred percent heresy; every one is a mixture of heresy and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan would not be so foolish as to come up with something that is pure heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Most of the time heretical beliefs are mixed in with the best truths.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a man receives the truths, he takes in heresies at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not easy for young believers to discern these heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should learn to not touch heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should flee from them and reject them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only those who are sober will save themselves from danger; those who are curious will always suffer the poisonous sting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>STANDARD RULES TO IDENTIFY HERESIES</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No young Christian can deal with heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The best thing for a young Christian to do is to turn away from them altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if you are in a place without a church or if you are alone, here are ten criteria for you to test whether a teaching is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If any of the ten criteria fits the description or if a person teaches any of these ten things, you have a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What determines a group as heretical or not is not the volume of teachings it produces, but the presence or absence of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as there is heresy, the group is off.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I would rather listen to a message with little truth but no heresy than to listen to one with much truth mixed up with a little heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A little poison can kill a person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the same way, a little leaven can leaven the whole lump.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some of these heresies can only be identified by men with special gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It may appear easy to identify these heresies, but in reality it is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to ask if a teaching has a little heresy in it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If it does, we have to discard it even if the rest is good.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are many kinds of heresies.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some heresies completely deny the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some stand on the ground of miracles, works of wonders, and divination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some have to do with prophecies, some with questions related to judgment after death, and some with mortification of fleshly lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, each kind of heresy is propagated by many different groups.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There are many different kinds of heresies, and they are all different in their errors.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But as long as they err in one thing, they constitute a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, we must have substantial evidence before we can call a teaching a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Heresy is a strong word, and we must not condemn anyone as a heretic lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now let us examine the ten things that determine a heresy.</S>
