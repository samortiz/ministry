	 <h2 class="head4">The Testimony of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>On the day that the servant encountered Rebekah, he testified on behalf of Isaac, saying, &ldquo;Sarah my master&rsquo;s wife bore a son to my master after she had become old. And he has given all that he has to him&rdquo; (v. 36). This signifies the Holy Spirit testifying of Christ. When the Holy Spirit calls man, He enables man to know that Christ is the Son of God and that God has given everything in the universe to Christ. Everything includes all matters and all things. Everything of God and everything He has accomplished, have been given to His Son as the Heir (Heb. 1:2). When we are called, the Holy Spirit testifies within us that all that God has is for His Son. John 15 reveals that the Holy Spirit came to testify not concerning the Father but concerning the Son (v. 26).</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Pledge of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>After we have the sealing and the testimony of the Holy Spirit, the pledge of the Holy Spirit is added to us. Ephesians 1:14 and 2 Corinthians 1:22 both speak of a pledge. A pledge is similar to a pawn. When I take my clothes to a pawnshop, the pawnshop gives me a sum of money. The Japanese call their pawnshops &ldquo;pledge houses.&rdquo; A pledge is similar to something that has been pawned; thus, the thing that is pawned may also be called a pledge. The word <em>pledge</em> also has the meaning of a security. When we seek a loan from the bank, we must present a lien on our house to the bank as a security. Our house becomes the collateral. When the Holy Spirit enters into us, He is not only the seal but also the pledge, the pawn, the security. This security is the guarantee that God has given us, guaranteeing that everything in the heavens is ours.</p>
<p>When the servant met Rebekah, his first action was to give her a golden ring and bracelets. After obtaining the consent of Rebekah and her family, the old servant immediately brought forth gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother (Gen. 24:53). The gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing that the servant gave her were not a seal but a pledge, a security, which is something more than a seal.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is &ldquo;the pledge of our inheritance.&rdquo; The Greek word for <em>pledge</em> has the meaning of a sample. In the selling of land in ancient times, the seller was required to give the purchaser a sample of soil from the land to confirm that the land being sold contained that soil. Similarly, the gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing that the old servant gave to Rebekah were samples of the wealth of Isaac&rsquo;s house. The servant took a portion of Isaac&rsquo;s riches and gave it to Rebekah in order to show her the wealth of the one she was to marry. All the things were a pledge, guaranteeing that what was not yet in her hands would also be her portion. Previously, Abraham had given everything to Isaac; thus, if Rebekah married Isaac, all that he had would become hers. Because she had not yet seen or enjoyed the riches of Isaac, the servant gave a portion to her as a foretaste for her enjoyment, guaranteeing that the rest would come later.</p>
<p>The servant gave Rebekah gold jewelry, silver jewelry, and clothing. In typology, gold signifies the life of God, silver signifies the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, and clothing signifies the righteousnesses of the saints. Hence, the salvation that the Lord gives us is pledged by the Holy Spirit who works the Lord&rsquo;s redemption on the cross into us. It is in the Holy Spirit that God accepts and justifies us, and it is also because of the Holy Spirit that our behavior is changed. These things issue from the pledging of the Holy Spirit. Our receiving the pledge of the Holy Spirit includes our obtaining the life of God, the application of the Lord&rsquo;s redemption on the cross, our experience of being justified and reconciled by God, and a change in our behavior. It is in the Holy Spirit that we taste God&rsquo;s life, enjoy the element of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and experience being justified by God, which causes us to be accepted by God, have peace with God, be reconciled to God, and have a genuine change in our behavior. All that we receive in the Holy Spirit works out the completion of God&rsquo;s salvation in us, causing us to be fully saved.</p>
