   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 16:21-25 says, "From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shall by no means happen to You!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As followers of the Lord it is often difficult for us to have the experience of the cross because in our natural being we may have never realized how much the cross must work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that the ultimate result of the cross is to terminate us completely.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, from beginning to end, the work of the cross in a person who pursues and follows the Lord completely terminates his being and all that is of himself, step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This teaching is easy to understand but not that easy to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD PAYING ATTENTION NOT TO RIGHT AND WRONG BUT TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our natural being we cannot avoid the concept of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We tend to think that if we do something right, we are pleasing God, and if we do something good, we are in His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We seldom realize that what God pays attention to is beyond goodness and beyond right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What God pays attention to is whether we do things out of Christ or out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to our concept God rejects what is wrong and accepts what is right.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's view, however, only that which is of Christ is acceptable; whatever is of ourselves, whether good or bad, is utterly rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's view is different from man's view.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God does not take right and wrong or good and evil as the criterion; He takes Christ as the criterion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever is not of Christ, whether good or bad, is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only that which is lived out in Christ and by Christ can be accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In short, what God wants in us is not what we live out but what Christ lives out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE DIFFICULTY OF MAN IN CEASING HIS ACTIVITIES</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, there is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since man is a living being, having his own preference, thinking, emotion, will, and choice, how can he not live out himself?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can he cease all his activities and let Christ live out through him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is truly a difficult matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only is it difficult to stop ourselves in big matters, it is even more difficult to stop ourselves in small matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, if we are really enjoying ourselves in a conversation with someone, it is not easy for us to stop ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if we stop talking outwardly, we may still murmur within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is difficult for us to simply listen while others are telling us something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This shows us that when a person is active, it is not easy for him to stop his activity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the service of the church today we often do things out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Apparently, the things we do are good, right, and profitable, but actually they are done out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may even know that we do them out of ourselves, yet it is still difficult for us to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To a certain extent we all have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consider reading the Bible as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes while we are enjoying reading the Word, we may get an inward feeling that we should spend a little time to pray for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to spiritual principles, once we have such a feeling, we should immediately stop reading and pray instead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, usually we are not willing to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This again shows us that it is not easy for us to stop our activity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is the same with the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes we may fellowship with someone to a point where we are full of joy and want to continue talking with him, but we have a feeling within us that we should go visit a saint who is sick or has a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is one thing to have the willingness to fellowship with others, but it is another thing to have the feeling to go and visit the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, because we are too willing to fellowship, we are unable to stop, and because we are enjoying the fellowship, we would not visit the saints.</S>
