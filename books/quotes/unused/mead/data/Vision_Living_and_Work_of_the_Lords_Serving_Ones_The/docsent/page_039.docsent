   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING GREEK FOR STUDYING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those who desire to serve the Lord full time, especially the brothers, should learn Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If asked what the qualifications of a full-time brother should be, I would say that it is best to have a college degree and be conversant in Chinese, English, and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being conversant in Greek does not mean that one speaks Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, the emphasis is on the ability to read Greek and to consult reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Learning Greek is not for us to contact new believers; it is for us to study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible was written in two languages: Hebrew and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With the exception of a few verses, the New Testament is entirely in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, it is important for us to learn Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A person who studies the truth but does not know Greek can be considered an amateur.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we desire to know the truth, we must get to the source of the truth, that is, into the Greek language.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I never took a Greek class; neither was I taught.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, in 1932, more than fifty years ago, I had the feeling that I needed to learn Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A brother purchased a Greek-English interlinear Bible for me in a bookstore in Shanghai, and I began to learn Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I first learned the Greek alphabet and then read Greek grammar books.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some of those books were in English and some were Chinese translations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My knowledge of Greek gradually progressed from the alphabet, to the grammar with the language structure, and eventually to the study of different reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although I am not a Greek scholar, my explanation of the New Testament Greek is based on the study of past Greek scholars.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Greek commentaries of the New Testament that I regularly use are the best and the most authoritative.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I look up a word, I get into all the reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many footnotes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament are the extracts of the best reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are not simply my own understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, I have the full assurance that the footnotes will withstand any test.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regrettably, I did not emphasize learning languages in past trainings with the co-workers in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, we should have the view to study English.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>English is a common language that is needed to serve the Lord and also in doing ordinary things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A good knowledge of English and Chinese will help us in the publication work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>More than twenty years ago I visited cities all over America.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Wherever I went, I had an English-Chinese dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was a great help to me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must make progress, and in order to improve, we need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not born with knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no limit to what we can learn, but we need to learn in order to gain knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not have a Ph.D. in English, but when I speak with theologians, they marvel at the words and expressions that I use.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once while ministering near Boston, I used the word coinherence .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A well-known American Greek scholar who was present in the meeting was surprised that I used this word that is rarely used by modern theologians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He later wrote to me and expressed his appreciation of my teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE LORD S RECOVERY URGENTLY NEEDING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, I advise you all to learn and make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord s recovery urgently needs those who are prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Never think that the value of your service is not great since you are only on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Taiwan may be a small island, but it has a great prospect in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not know when the Lord will take us overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Throughout the two thousand years of church history, there has not been a group of Christians who have had the Lord s testimony and truth and who were able to spread to all five continents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, this is our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Asia the Lord s recovery has entered Burma Myanmar and India.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Except for the Arab world, there is a church in nearly every country.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are at least two hundred twenty churches from North America through Mexico to South America.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Europe there are at least ten churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Africa six countries have churches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In South Africa there are at least three churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In addition, there are also churches in Australia and New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The churches in these places have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the past two thousand years there has never been a group of Christians who, having the Lord s testimony and His truth, spread to all five continents and had fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No matter which country we go to for fellowship, the saints in the local churches welcome us warmly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In addition, our literature has been translated into Russian for the spread to Russian-speaking regions in order to make contact with the people there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The churches in the Lord s recovery have spread throughout the world, yet they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In every place there is a pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is true in South America, and it is also true of North Africa and South Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our problem is that we do not have mature saints who are prepared to go forth for propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is our urgent need.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not think that the work in Taiwan is for Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, we are learning to work here.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One day we will go to other localities in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we must not neglect the basics.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our goal may be high, but we should begin with the most basic steps.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not be in a hurry to spread to other places; rather, we should learn here in Taiwan and seek to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not forget that the basic requirement of one who serves the Lord is to be fully equipped with the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Paul was able to write fourteen Epistles because he had the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the Lord gives us a feeling to go to Africa, we should equip ourselves with the local language.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since English is the common language in Africa, we should be equipped with English.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the Lord wants to send us to Latin America, we must study Spanish.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should be equipped in the truth, in languages, and in general knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should also know the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we will be able to go out and propagate.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today the Lord s recovery is on all five continents of the world; the pioneers are already there, cutting the way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All we need to do is to send people to strengthen them and help propagate.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It would be good if we had two to three hundred saints who can speak Spanish and who are ready to go and propagate in Central and South America.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Central and South America are open to us, but we have no one to send.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>NOT HOLDING ON TO OLD THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We know so much truth, and the church is rich in resources; however, in the past decades we have not exceeded one hundred churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must learn to make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Human history is a history of making progress.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Those who are conservative and hold on to old ways will be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Even the newspapers in Taiwan have improved over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They have adopted new terminologies in different areas, including finance, economy, and science.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All the business enterprises in the world are constantly improving their methods.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>China suffered a great loss during the last years of the Ching Dynasty because it was very conservative.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Japan, on the contrary, caught up with the Western world and is now a first-class nation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should learn lessons from the world situation and learn how to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the method of our work remains the same as it was thirty years ago, we will fall behind and be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have the complete set of Life-studies in front of us, but not many of us have entered into the riches they contain.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is regrettable.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>HAVING A SPIRIT OF INHERITING</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>FROM THOSE WHO PRECEDE US AND</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>INSPIRING THOSE WHO WILL FOLLOW US</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I hope that the younger generation can change this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Otherwise, there will be no future in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is imperative that we change.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This does not mean that the younger generation should start a revolution; rather, they need a proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>They need to know how to inherit from those who have gone before us and how to inspire those who will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They must inherit the strong points of previous generations and inspire those who will follow to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We have many strong points in the work, and we also have many weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Our greatest weakness and problem are that we hold on to the old things and are not willing to learn and to change.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>As a result, the work has come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The younger generation needs to receive the good points and continue to develop and move forward.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>By the Lord s mercy, I was seventy years old when I began to write the Life-studies of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Chinese say that it is rare for a man to live to the age of seventy, but it was at that late age that I began writing the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Each year I spent an average of five months, limiting myself to a small room, to research reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>After continually endeavoring for eleven years, I eventually finished this task with the assistance of two helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Therefore, I have the position to speak these words.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Even while I am conducting this training, I use dictionaries and reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I am continually learning.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>May we all make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is not too late for the older brothers and sisters to make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We must have the spirit and attitude to encourage the younger ones to make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>A person who serves the Lord should have a clear goal for his life and should make progress and continually learn.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He must never stick to old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>He should begin learning the most basic points and proceed forward step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Taiwan is a large field that requires our labor, and we must experience the Lord in our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We hope to evangelize Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>This responsibility lies with the younger generation.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The young ones should go to the villages to preach the gospel and study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>One of these days they will be useful in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Furthermore, they should also learn to bring in new ones like schools of fish, one school after another.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We look to the Lord to raise up two thousand full-timers in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Then the Lord s recovery will have a way to go on.</S>
