Our feelings may be right some of the time, but in essence they are deceptive. We should not look for truth among deceptions, because we can never find it. Satan can speak some truths, but we have to reject everything that comes from his mouth because in essence he is a liar. Even when he speaks the truth, he speaks it for the purpose of deceiving others. We have to calm down our feelings completely. This requires the breaking of the outer man.</p><p>The spirit is surrounded by the soul, just as a hand is surrounded by a glove. A glove must be empty before a hand can get into it. If a glove has something in it, how can it receive a hand? Similarly, if our mind, emotion, and will are filled with thoughts, feelings, and opinions instead of being empty and available, when the spirit needs to use them, it will find itself bound. Under such circumstances, it is hard to have right judgments.</p><p>In order to have right judgments, we need to "let this mind be in [us], which was also in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 2:5). This means to have the mind of Christ. We can only improve in judgment when we take the mind of Christ as our own. In order to improve our utterance, we have to be enlightened within. Our inner being has to shine with light. Only then will our judgments be accurate. We treasure accurate judgments, but such judgments come from practice, not from gift.</p><p>If the foot is wearing the shoe, the foot will feel very comfortable. But if the shoe is "wearing" the foot, no one can take a step forward. The shoe must fit the foot; no one can trim the foot to fit the shoe. If feelings are improper, the spirit cannot be free, because the spirit will be bound by the feelings. Rather than being directed by the spirit, the soul will be directing the spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">The Feelings Must Match God's Light</h2><p>Lo Yi-xin: Since the work started in Canton, I have felt quite useless within myself. I cannot do anything, and I do not know how to begin any work. On the one hand, I am afraid of making mistakes. On the other hand, I am afraid of being counted as unfaithful in my responsibility. I feel that I need a mentor, a teacher to guide me. I am willing to learn and follow.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Your feelings should be strengthened. Your condition is different from Brother Chou's. He has too many feelings and should learn to deny them. You do not have enough feelings. Although you have some feelings, they are not strong enough. Our feelings should match the light we receive from God. Once we realize that we are truly weak, we will be conscious of our real impotence. If the Lord grants us a little light concerning what we are, we will receive great profit; this profit will be more than what we could learn by ourselves in twenty years.</p><p>What we really need is light. If light increases, we will see our weakness in a clearer perspective. We will be humbled to such an extent that no weakness will be a barrier to us. When we have not learned our lessons well enough, our feeling of weakness can be a hindrance to us. But once our weakness breaks out and spreads like leprosy, then we are healed. When our feeling of weakness is light, it is a hindrance to us; we feel that we can still do something and that there is still something about which we can boast. When the feeling of weakness overwhelms us, however, this feeling will no longer constitute a hindrance. God's power is manifested when we are down to our weakest point. Actually, not many people understand Paul's experience in 2 Corinthians 12:9. Psalm 4:1 says, "You made room for me when I was in straits." The feeling of weakness must reach a stringent point before we find "room" being made for us. It takes at least three to five years, perhaps even eight to ten years, before we can understand this. We cannot be impatient. God has to bring us to the valley of weakness before we can be brought to a spacious land.</p><p>What is death? It is being weak to the uttermost. We can know about the crucifixion with Christ without knowing the meaning of weakness. In such a case, crucifixion with Christ is merely a doctrine. There is no such thing as knowing death without knowing the meaning of weakness.</p><p>You can go on the same way as you have in the past. You do not have to ask the Lord to make you stronger. On the contrary, you should ask the Lord to increase your feeling of weakness so that you can be brought to a spacious place. May God show you not only your powerlessness but His gracious power as well.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
