   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER WAY FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The proper way to have the church life is simply to have Christ as the foundation upon the proper ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That is all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must not care for anything but Christ and His church on the proper ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we are strong in the spirit and full of Christ, it will be easy for us to go on with the local church, caring not for other things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether or not people play the piano in their meetings, we simply do not care.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We only care to minister Christ to people and have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would not criticize or be occupied with different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether people have the Lord's Table in the morning or in the evening, it simply does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as the church in our city is on the proper ground of unity, we will be one with it and minister Christ in it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will relinquish all opinions and care not for any regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then it will be exceedingly easy for us to go on with any local church with the ministry of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Christians come to a new place, they always pay attention to the little things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some always look to see whether the bread at the Lord's Table is leavened or unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others want to know whether wine or grape juice is used in the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They always consider these trivial matters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are others who have certain kinds of rules and regulations for the Lord's Table.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These, of course, are not written, but nevertheless understood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they go to another place, they will be very critical if people do not practice the Lord's Table as they do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Oh, we all need the Lord's deliverance!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must see that we are not for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are for Christ and His church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as the saints love the Lord and come together on the proper ground of unity to minister Christ to one another, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all must be fully occupied with Christ and the church on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must not pay attention to anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And we must give others the freedom to act according to the way they feel led of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must not criticize anyone according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All we need is to keep the unity and minister Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be liberal in our attitude and strong in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As far as my realization is concerned, I do not like to use many small cups at the Lord's Table.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To me it is contrary to Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And I do not prefer baptism by sprinkling rather than baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To me, this also is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I also feel that the sisters should cover their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in all these past years, I have never insisted upon these things and I have never been troubled by them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I go to a certain place, if the people use one large cup or many small cups, I will not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you let me do it, I will have one large cup; but if you do it, you may have the liberty to do as you feel led of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wherever we go, wherever we are, we must go along with the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps we would like to practice immersion, but the church practices sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we should not impose immersion upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, this does not mean that we should not fellowship with them regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If they would take what we have seen, it is good; but if not, we should not cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we realize that by speaking of a certain matter we will cause a disturbance, we should not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Though we may not agree with them in certain things, we should not impose anything upon them or insist upon anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must go along with them in their way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are in a position to make a decision regarding certain things, perhaps we would not proceed in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if we are not in such a position, we should not say anything to create trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This does not mean that we agree with them in their way, but simply that we do not care for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We only care for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no other way for us to keep the unity on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all must be so liberal; otherwise, sooner or later, we will create another division.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must learn to be liberal and general.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For anyone not to pray-read the Word, in my estimation is a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever I open the Bible, I would pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if you do not do this, I am not troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Regarding things like this, we must have a general attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For the ground of unity, we must be definite; but for other things, we must be general.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we will have real unity and a proper expression of the Body of Christ in the city where we live.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the proper and unique way to practice the church life.</S>
