<p class="bold">WEEK 3 — DAY 1</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 4:12, 16-22</h2><p>12 &nbsp;Now when He heard that John was delivered up, He <sup>1</sup>withdrew into Galilee.</p><p class="bold">16 &nbsp;The people sitting in darkness have seen a <sup>1</sup>great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.”</p><p>17 &nbsp;From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</p><p>18 &nbsp;And while He was walking beside the <sup>1</sup>Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, <sup>2</sup>casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</p><p class="bold">19 &nbsp;And He said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p><p class="bold">20 &nbsp;And immediately leaving the nets, they <sup>1</sup>followed Him.</p><p class="bold">21 &nbsp;And going on from there, He saw another two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, <sup>1</sup>mending their nets; and He called them.</p><p class="bold">22 &nbsp;And immediately leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>12<sup>1</sup> John the Baptist ministered in the wilderness, not in the holy temple in the holy city; still, his ministry was in Judea, not far from the “holy” things. Because of the people’s rejection of John, the Lord Jesus withdrew into Galilee to begin His ministry, far away from the holy temple and the holy city. This occurred sovereignly to fulfill the prophecy in Isa. 9:1-2.</p><p>16<sup>1</sup> The new King’s ministry for the kingdom of the heavens began not with earthly power but with heavenly light, which was the King Himself as the light of life shining in the shadow of death.</p><p>18<sup>1</sup> The new King’s ministry was not in the capital but beside the sea. His forerunner’s ministry began by the riverside and consisted of burying the religious and terminating their religion. The new King’s ministry began by the seashore and consisted of catching men who were not very religious, men who lived around the sea instead of in the holy place, and making them fishers of men for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>18<sup>2</sup> When Peter and Andrew were called by the Lord, they were casting a net into the sea. They were made fishers of men (v. 19). Eventually, Peter became the first great fisher for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:37-42; 4:4).</p><p>20<sup>1</sup> Prior to this time, in the place where John had preached, Andrew, one of the two disciples there of John the Baptist, had brought Peter to the Lord (John 1:35-36, 40-42). That was the first time Andrew and Peter had met the Lord. Here the Lord met them the second time, this time at the Sea of Galilee. They were attracted by the Lord as the great light shining in the darkness of death and followed Him for the establishing of the kingdom of the heavens in the light of life.</p><p>21<sup>1</sup> When James and John were called by the Lord, they were in a boat, mending their nets. Eventually, John became a real mender, mending the rents in the church by his ministry of life. (See his three Epistles and chs. 2 and 3 of Revelation.)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>In Matthew 4 there is no record…of any miracle being done by the Lord when Peter was called. However, in Matthew 4, there was the great light that attracted the first four disciples. This attraction came not from what the Lord Jesus did; it came from what He was.…No one who follows the Lord because of what He does can be trustworthy or faithful. The trustworthy ones are those who are caught by what the Lord is.
