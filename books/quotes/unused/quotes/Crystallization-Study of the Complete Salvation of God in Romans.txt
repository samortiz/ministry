The gospel of God, as the subject of Romans, concerns Christ as the Spirit living within the believers after His resurrection
The gospel in this book is the gospel of the One who is now indwelling His believers as their subjective Savior
Many expositions of Romans divide it into sections: condemnation, justification, sanctification, selection, and Christian behavior
God's righteousness, which is solid and steadfast, is the foundation of His throne and the base on which His kingdom is built
If there were no righteousness, God Himself would be finished, the entire universe would collapse, and we could not exist
The best robe put upon the prodigal son by the father signifies Christ as the God-satisfying righteousness to cover the penitent sinner
As the resurrected One, Christ is in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and that is always acceptable to God
God's righteousness is Christ, and the believers' faith is also Christ , whom they appreciate and receive in their hearing of the gospel
When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him
We have not yet been saved to the extent of being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God's Son
Redemption, justification, and reconciliation, which are accomplished outside of us by the death of Christ, redeem us objectively
The two divine transfers cover four chapters of the book of Romans which may be regarded as the kernel of the New Testament
Chapter five may be entitled 'In Adam'; chapter six, 'In Christ'; chapter seven, 'In the Flesh'; and chapter eight, 'In the Spirit'
In Christ we have righteousness as a gift, and we have been approved by God according to His standard of righteousness
Our need is not to behave in a certain way but to be found in Christ by being found in the Spirit through our union with the Spirit
The all-inclusive Spirit, who includes the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is in us and is mingled with our spirit
Into eternal life actually means 'into the New Jerusalem' because the New Jerusalem is the totality of eternal life
The consummation of the gushing living water that we drink will be the New Jerusalem as the totality of the eternal life
The issue of our present reigning in life will be the New Jerusalem as the universal incorporation of God and man
The Spirit and life are mentioned in Romans 8:2, but only in connection with the working of the law of the Spirit of life
The law that has freed us from the law of sin, which is of Satan, who dwells in the members of our fallen body , is of this Spirit of life
The Spirit of God implies that this Spirit is of the One who was from eternity past who created the universe and is the origin of all things
On the one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body; the Spirit does not do it for us
On the other hand, we should not attempt to deal with our body by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit
The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father
Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father
Because we have now been born of God and are related to Him in life, it is very normal and sweet for us to call Him Father
Gods complete salvation is in one spiritual practical and experiential union of the Spirit of life with our spirit forming a mingled spirit
The one spiritual union is with our spirit the regenerated spirit of the believers in Christ indwelt by the Spirit forming a mingled spirit
It is through this Spirit that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit , and it is by this Spirit that we enjoy the riches of the Triune God
The Spirit of God today, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, dwells in our regenerated human spirit and works in our spirit
Romans 8:11b says, 'He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you'
Grace is for us to experience God's organic salvation, whereas the gift of righteousness is for God's judicial redemption
We are branches of the wild olive tree that were grafted into Christ, the cultivated olive tree, who is one with Israel
We, as the grafted branches, and Christ, as the cultivated olive tree, live together one mingled life in one mingled living
It is when we receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life that we call on the Lord in a proper way
When we are controlled by the divine life, we surely will think so as to be sober-minded, as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith
When we are a person under the ruling of the divine life, we will take the lead in showing honor one to another
To rejoice with those who rejoice and to weep with those who weep are impossible except when we are under the ruling of the divine life
We must be subject to all authorities, realizing that they have been established under the sovereign arrangement of God
One effect of our reigning in life is that we are awakened, made alert, made watchful, and not lulled to sleep by this age
God's complete salvation is for us to reign in life by the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness
When we are all reigning in life, living under the ruling of the divine life, the issue is the real and practical Body life
As a man, He rejected His natural humanity and lived a human life under the restriction of the divine life of His heavenly Father
There is no possibility for us to live the church life if we are not under the ruling and control of the divine life
In order to practice the church life that he introduced in chapter twelve we must strictly observe the matters set forth in chapter fourteen
Many saints who love the Lord and seek to live the church life have failed because they were either negligent or mistaken in this matter
Our receiving of the believers under the reigning in life is first according to God's receiving and then according to Christ's receiving
In verses 17 through 19 Paul was very strict with the divisive and dissenting ones who make divisions, without compromise or yielding
