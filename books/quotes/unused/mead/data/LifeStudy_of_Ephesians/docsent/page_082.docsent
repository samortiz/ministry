   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUILT INTO A DWELLING PLACE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 22 says, In Whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word you here, which refers to the local saints, indicates that the building in verse 21 is universal and the building in verse 22 is local.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse Paul was saying that the local saints, the saints in Ephesus, were being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in these verses Paul covered both the universal aspect and the local aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the building is growing this refers to the universal aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The believers in a particular locality are being built together this is the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why does Paul use the term holy temple in referring to the universal aspect and the term dwelling place of God when speaking of the local aspect?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is the difference, if any, between the holy temple and the dwelling place of God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Apart from the universal temple, there is not another temple called the local temple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The temple and the dwelling place refer to two aspects of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not consider the temple a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The temple is the place in which God s people contact God, worship Him, and hear His oracle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The dwelling place is a place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God rests in His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the temple and the dwelling place are not two distinct places.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, they are two aspects, two functions or usages, of the same building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is the place where God s people contact God, worship Him, and receive His word, and it is also the place of God s rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the local churches are part of the universal church, not something in addition to it or apart from it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the local churches added together equal the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that apart from the local churches there is no universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the building of the local church is the building of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the local churches have just one building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church in Anaheim does not have one building; the church in Chicago, another; and the church in New York, still another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, our natural concept of the building is that there is a different building in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this universe there is just one building with a universal aspect and a local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter how many churches there may be on earth, there is still just one building with these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 22 says that we are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirit here refers to the believers human spirit indwelt by God s Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s Spirit is the Dweller, not the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The dwelling place is in the believers spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the dwelling place of God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 21 says that the holy temple is in the Lord, and verse 22, that the dwelling place of God is in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This indicates that the Lord is one with our spirit and that our spirit is one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be in our spirit actually is to be in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Also, to be in the Lord is to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We simply cannot separate our spirit from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, our spirit is the place where the building of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The building is not in our mind, emotion, soul, or heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is absolutely a matter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we wish to understand such matters as the foundation of the apostles and prophets and the difference between the holy temple and the dwelling place of God, we need to have a sober mind as we study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible is the most logical of books.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our God is not foolish, and He never speaks nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is very logical, and everything in His Word is logical.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, we should not have an undisciplined mentality as we study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, in reading the Bible we must exercise our sober mind to ask the proper questions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then the light will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a basic principle in understanding the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>May we all, especially the young brothers and sisters, learn to study the Bible in this way.</S>
