The phrase "their own things" here refers not to virtues and qualities as in 2:4, but to our personal affairs. We may care for our personal affairs and not for the things of Christ. Probably you have not realized that personal affairs are a negative thing keeping you from the experience of Christ. However, you may actually care more for your domestic affairs than for Christ, more for your education or employment than for the church life. But of Timothy Paul could say that he would "genuinely care for what concerns" the church, whereas others cared for their own things, not the things of Christ. If we go on caring for our own things instead of caring for the things of Christ, there will be no way to have the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Dogs, Evil Workers, the Concision</H2><P>In 3:2 Paul issues a serious charge: "Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision." Those who were dogs, evil workers, the concision, held to certain religious concepts which were troubling to the saints and were a source of distraction from Christ. In dealing with such people we should care for one basic principle: Does this person's word help us to experience Christ and to have more of the church life, or does it distract us from Christ and the church? If it does not encourage us to experience Christ and to live the church life, we should pay no attention to it. That person must be a dog, an evil worker, one who contemptuously follows certain religious rituals (the meaning of the term concision). Instead of trying to determine whether the word of such a person is right or wrong, ask if his speaking helps you to enjoy Christ or distracts you from Christ, if it encourages you to have more of the church life or keeps you away from the church. If it turns you away from Christ and the church, it is the speech of one who is a dog, an evil worker, a member of the concision, and one who should be avoided.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Confidence in the Flesh</H2><P>In 3:4-8 Paul goes on to deal with yet another negative thing&#151;confidence in the flesh. Verse 4 says, "Though I myself could have confidence also in the flesh; if any other man thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I more." In these verses confidence in the flesh refers to all the good items or qualities we have in the flesh. For Paul, these included circumcision on the eighth day and being a Hebrew of the Hebrews. For us today, they may include pride in our nationality or culture. Such confidence in the flesh keeps us from Christ and frustrates the church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Anxiety</H2><P>Another negative thing found in Philippians is anxiety. In 4:6 Paul says, "In nothing be anxious." To be anxious is to worry. It is very difficult for people who are cautious and sensitive not to have anxiety. Many years ago there was a fire in the place where I worked, and later, a burglary. This caused me to be anxious, to be filled with worry over the threat of fire and theft. As a sensitive person, it is easy for me to have this kind of anxiety.</P><P>I have prayed over Paul's word about anxiety many times. I have said, "Lord, I thank You for this word. This is not only Your commandment, but also Your promise. Lord, I take Your word and ask You to save me from anxiety." But the more I prayed in this way, the more anxious I became. How difficult it is to be free from anxiety! Anxiety is a very irritating "mosquito." It seems that the only ones who have no anxiety are those who are careless about life. Their attitude seems to be, "Life is in the hands of God. There is no need to worry about it." This, however, is not true faith, but the expression of a natural indifference. Those who are careless may have no anxiety, but every sensitive and cautious person suffers a great deal of anxiety.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Secret of Experiencing Christ &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
