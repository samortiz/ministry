<h2 class=head2>The Problem of Head Covering</h2><p>The seventh case found in 1 Corinthians involves the matter of head covering (11:2-16). The problem of head covering is a debate not only of today; it was there already in the first century.<p>Head covering is related to the headship, the lordship, of Christ in the universe. Verse 3 says, “But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.” Therefore, there is the need of the woman to have her head covered. Here again we must apply the first principle of this book. The only ones who are willing to cover their head are those who know how to experience the cross to deal with their self and how to take Christ as everything to be their Head. Covering the head is a matter of experiencing Christ as the Head. This includes taking Christ as life and everything and experiencing the cross.<p>The best way to help people realize the real meaning of head covering is to help them to experience Christ as life, as the Head, and as everything. It is also to help them to realize the real experience of the cross in order to deal with the natural man and the self. If we are able to help the saints in these two matters, the sisters will be not only willing but also obliged to cover their heads, especially when they pray. However, we must give people the full liberty. On the one hand, we should not be “Pharisees” or make others to be “Pharisees,” while on the other hand, we should not lower the standard.<h2 class=head2>The Problem of the Lord’s Supper</h2><p>The next case in 1 Corinthians concerns the Lord’s supper (11:17-34). The case of head covering concerns the Head (v. 3), while the Lord’s supper (the Lord’s table) concerns the Body. In this way, chapter eleven deals with the universal man—the Head and the Body. In principle, we all have to be right with the Head, and we also must be right with the Body. If we are wrong with the Lord’s supper, we are wrong with the Body because we do not discern the body (v. 29).<p>The loaf on the table has two meanings. The Lord’s supper is for the remembrance of the Lord Himself. Therefore, at the Lord’s supper the loaf signifies the Lord’s physical body crucified on the cross for our redemption. We view the loaf in remembrance of the Lord Himself. The Lord’s table, however, is for the communion, the fellowship, of the saints; it is the Lord’s feast for the fellowship of the Body. Verse 16 of chapter ten says, “The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?”, and verse 17 says, “We who are many are one Body.” While we fellowship with one another around the Lord’s table, we view the loaf as the symbol of the universal, mystical Body of Christ, which is the church (Eph. 4:4). Thus, one aspect of the loaf is for the remembrance of the Lord Himself, while the other aspect is for fellowship with all the saints in the one mystical Body.<p>Therefore, to discern the body in 1 Corinthians 11:29 has two meanings. Whenever we come to partake of the loaf, we must discern that it is not something ordinary, because it symbolizes the Lord’s body crucified for us on the cross. We should not partake of it as we would an ordinary piece of bread in the morning. Rather, we should partake of it with reverence. Moreover, we must also discern the universal, mystical Body of Christ. This is why we should not partake of the “communion” in the denominations, because they are divisions. To partake of their “communion” is to partake of their division. That is not the Lord’s table but a table of division. The Lord’s table must be on the proper ground, representing not a sect or denomination but the Body.<p>Although there may be a “communion” in a denominational church with thousands of members who are all genuinely saved, that table still does not represent the one Body. Rather, it represents the Lutheran, Presbyterian, or Baptist denomination. Regardless of how large their membership is, it still represents that denomination. On the contrary, if there are only three or four brothers standing on the ground of oneness, representing the Body, what they have is the proper Lord’s table in the discernment of the Body. This is the proper meaning of discern the body in 11:29.<p>We must have a proper relationship with the Head and the Body. The matter of head covering ensures that we have a right relationship with the Head, and the Lord’s table keeps us in a right relationship with the Lord’s Body. Today many Christians pay attention to the remembrance of the Lord, but they neglect and even oppose the matter of the Body. Therefore, their table does not represent the Body; it represents their denomination. This nullifies this whole portion of 1 Corinthians; the headship is gone, and the Body is gone. This is the subtle will of the devil, the enemy of God. May the Lord be merciful to us. We must be humble to submit ourselves to His headship and be submissive to the Body; that is, we must be right with the Head and with the Body. We can do this only by experiencing Christ and taking the cross.
