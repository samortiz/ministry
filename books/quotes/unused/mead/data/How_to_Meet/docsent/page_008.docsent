   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MEETING WITH SOME PERSONAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>EXPERIENCES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Read the last chapters of the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So many of the disciples had some personal experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Mary did you know the story.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Early in the morning of the day of resurrection Mary received an experience of Christ John 20:11-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The two disciples walking to Emmaus also received a vital, personal experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were so zealous for Christ, and suddenly Christ came and joined them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not know it was the Lord, but later when they constrained Him to abide with them, their eyes were opened and they recognized Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then He vanished out of their sight.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Immediately they decided to turn back to Jerusalem, and arriving there, they found a meeting in progress.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the meeting they were told how the Lord was resurrected and had appeared to Simon, and it seemed that they said, Amen, we saw Him too.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then suddenly Jesus Himself appeared again Luke 24:1-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All these verses show how so many of the disciples in the early days, before they were in the meetings, had some strange, wonderful, and precious experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also need to have this kind of personal experiences of our dear Lord in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then when we come to the meeting, we have something bubbling and overflowing from us as a testimony to all the others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have something as our experiences of Christ to speak about in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You know, many times when we are sharing something of our experiences of the Lord in the meeting, while we are talking, Jesus Himself is with us; we are so conscious of His presence in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our daily walk, we do need some extra portion from a sweet contact with the Lord Jesus that we may have something to bring to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Take this principle and put it into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Day by day we should have some personal, intimate, sweet contact with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times I have had the same kind of experience as those two brothers going to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many times when I have opened the Bible, it seemed that I could not see Jesus in the Word; but after a while, it was so wonderful, Jesus appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My heart was bubbling and burning within me; then suddenly, it seemed that He disappeared, and I was so disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have you ever had this kind of experience?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I have felt that I must go to the meeting and tell the brothers what a wonderful, personal contact I ve had with Jesus that day and how He seemed to disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I have gone to the meeting and while I was giving such a testimony, there Jesus was!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times it is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do need the personal, sweet experiences of the resurrected Christ in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>MEETING AT THE PLACE APPOINTED BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The next principle is that we must meet at the place appointed by Jesus, not the place chosen by us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The disciples were told to go into Galilee and there they would see Him Matt 28:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them Matt 28:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why did the Lord Jesus not tell His disciples that He would meet with them in Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was resurrected in the area of Jerusalem; why would He go far to the north, to Galilee, to meet with His disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord did this deliberately, purposely, to move the Christian meeting away from the Jewish religious center.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The meeting which He appointed had nothing to do with Jerusalem, nothing to do with the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord wanted the meetings to be absolutely removed from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today, in principle, we have no right to choose a place to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The choice is not with us, but with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have the prerogative to choose a place, we are divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all must meet in the place appointed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Learn to give up your concept, your choices.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to come together in the place which the Lord appoints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>MEETING THE LORD HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever we come to the meeting, we must come with the intention of meeting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him Matt 28:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we come to a meeting, we must realize that we are coming to meet our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This matter must be emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We always consider that we are coming for edification or for some other purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But we need to have a deep realization that our only purpose is to meet our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not care whether there is a good speaker or good message.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should only care to meet our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Consider all the meetings the Lord Jesus had with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We could almost say that there was not one meeting with a message.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Have you noticed that?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But Jesus always stood in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They saw the Lord that was enough.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We do not need the teachings, we do not need the messages; all we need is the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we see Him, we can rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We go to the meeting not to hear a great speaker; we go to the meeting to meet Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not go to the meeting to listen to a good message.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We go to the meeting to meet our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we see Jesus in the meeting we can say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We just rejoice at His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>MEETING TO SATISFY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>AND BE SATISFIED BY HIM</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The meaning and purpose of the proper meeting is to give the Lord something to eat and also for Him to give us something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Have you noticed that two times in the record of these meetings the Lord asked His disciples if they had something to eat?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Have you any meat?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He asked.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once they answered Him, No John 21:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But praise the Lord, another time they did say, We have a little Luke 24:41-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They did not have much, they just had a little, a mere piece of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It was not even a whole fish.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Look into Darby s translation and some other better translations they do not say fish, but just a part of a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They just gave Him a part of a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the King James Version you have and of a honeycomb.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But in the most trustworthy manuscript you do not have this phrase.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What they gave Him was just a part of a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But though it was so little, the Lord ate it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The disciples gave the Lord just a little, but the Lord gave His disciples plenty.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When He asked them that day by the seashore if they had any meat and they answered No, the Lord gave them a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He not only gave them a part of a fish, but plenty of fish.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>And not only fish, but also bread.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The Lord Jesus said, Come and dine, and they did John 21:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>How to meet?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We must meet to satisfy the Lord and be satisfied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To meet is to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Our meeting must be a kind of eating, a kind of feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We bring something as a feast for Christ, and Christ brings something as a feast for us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Christ comes to the meeting to feast with us and we with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Every Christian meeting should be a feast which satisfies both the Lord and us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we are not satisfied in our meeting, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In all our meetings we need a table, a mutual table.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We eat together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We have something for Him, and He has something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Undoubtedly He has more for us than we have for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>What we can afford Him is just a little, just a limited portion, but what He can afford us is unlimited and inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We need to take all these basic principles and put them into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We must always be outside of religion without any form; we must always meet in resurrection as the Lord s brethren; we must meet with some personal experience of Christ in the place chosen and appointed by Him; and we must gather to meet the Lord, to satisfy Him and be satisfied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we can find all these principles in our meetings, we are right and we have the proper Christian meetings.</S>
