<h2 class="head1">CHRIST VERSUS THE WATERPOT</h2>
<p>The waterpot could hold water from the well, but Christ could give living water. When the Samaritan woman did not have Christ, she had to rely on the waterpot in order to draw water. But now that she had met Christ and knew that Christ could give her living water, she believed in Him, went into the city, and testified to the people, saying, &ldquo;Is this not the Christ?&rdquo; (v. 29).</p>
<p>When the Samaritan woman believed in Christ, she gained Christ and the living water. Therefore, she no longer wanted her waterpot, and she no longer wanted to draw water. Instead, she left her waterpot and went to testify concerning Christ. Her life had changed. Initially, she brought her waterpot to draw water, but she now left her waterpot to testify concerning Christ. She went away with Christ. Initially, she needed the waterpot to draw water, but she did not need the waterpot when she had Christ and the living water. Without Christ she had to rely on the waterpot. With Christ she did not need to rely on the waterpot. When Christ came, she left the waterpot.</p>
<p>When Christ comes, everything else leaves. Those who have Christ have no needs. Those who do not have Christ are spiritually thirsty, and their human life is empty; they seek amusement, entertainment, the pleasures of sin, material enjoyment, and worldly blessings to quench their spiritual thirst and to fill the void in their human life. When they have Christ, they are spiritually satisfied, their human life is fulfilled, and they no longer need entertainment or material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Mr. Moody once preached for several days in a place in the United States. Every day he saw a woman in the audience who was very moved. After the last meeting the woman said to Mr. Moody, &ldquo;I want to believe in Christ, but I cannot live without the theater; I have been going to the theater with my father ever since I was young. Now my husband often takes me to the theater. Much of our time is spent in the theater.&rdquo; Moody asked her, &ldquo;I noticed that you have been listening to my messages these few days. Did I say anything about going to the theater?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Moody then said, &ldquo;Every day my messages were printed in the newspaper. Have you read in the newspaper that I said something about going to the theater?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I have not.&rdquo; Moody then asked her, &ldquo;Then how did you come up with this matter of going to the theater?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I thought that you would not want people to go to the theater.&rdquo; Moody said, &ldquo;Do not talk about going to the theater. I will speak to you about Christ.&rdquo; He then quoted some verses and spoke to her about Christ. That evening her husband took her to the theater as usual. As soon as the curtains were drawn, she told her husband, &ldquo;I am leaving. This is not my place.&rdquo; Her husband said, &ldquo;Perhaps you are insane from listening to Moody&rsquo;s preaching.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;I want to be &lsquo;insane&rsquo; like this for the rest of my life!&rdquo; A person who has Christ has no need and no appetite for the theater.</p>
<p>In 1937 I gave some messages in Nanking. One day someone brought a fashionable and extravagant woman to see me. The woman told me that she was deeply moved by the messages and felt that she should believe in Christ, but she did not know whether she could continue to watch movies after believing in Christ. I realized from her question that she liked to watch movies. I could not tell her that she could continue watching movies after believing in Christ. However, I did not want to tell her that she could not watch movies after believing in Christ, because if I did, she might refuse. I asked her, &ldquo;If your son were playing with a sharp knife, how would you take the knife out of his hand?&rdquo; She said that the best method was to scatter some candy and fruit on the floor, because the child would drop the knife to pick up the candy and fruit. I said, &ldquo;This method is very good. In the same way, when you believe in Christ, your hobbies will spontaneously fall away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the meaning of believing in Christ. This is Christ&rsquo;s salvation. It is not a matter of whether you can keep your hobbies, forms of enjoyment, or love for the world after you believe in Christ. You will not need your hobbies, forms of enjoyment, or love for the world after you believe in Christ. When you have Christ, you do not need these things. When Christ comes, these things will leave. I know of a customs officer who loved to smoke cigarettes and make jokes at parties. However, after he prayed and accepted the Lord, he changed. He forgot about cigarettes and no longer took them to work. Furthermore, he no longer liked to make jokes at parties. Christ came, and these matters left.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATISFACTION</h2>
<p>The Samaritan woman was satisfied when she had Christ and the living water. Furthermore, the Lord Jesus was also satisfied. John 4 shows that two parties were satisfied; the Samaritan woman and the Lord were both satisfied. When the Samaritan woman received the Lord, she gained the Lord, and the Lord gained her. She was satisfied because she gained the Lord, and the Lord was also satisfied because He gained her. She was a thirsty sinner when she went to the well with her waterpot to draw water. Now that she was satisfied within, she left her waterpot because she no longer needed to draw water to drink. The Lord asked the disciples to buy food to eat and asked the Samaritan woman for water to drink because He was both hungry and thirsty. When He was satisfied within, He no longer needed to drink water or eat the food the disciples bought. The Lord satisfied the Samaritan woman, and she satisfied the Lord. The Lord was her satisfaction, and she was the Lord&rsquo;s satisfaction. Before she had gained the Lord, the Lord did not have her. After she had gained the Lord, the Lord had gained her. When she was thirsty, the Lord was thirsty. When she was satisfied, the Lord was also satisfied.</p>
<p>When a sinner does not have the Savior, the Savior does not have that sinner. When a sinner is thirsty, the Savior is also thirsty. It is not until a sinner has the Savior and is satisfied that the Savior gains the sinner and is satisfied. The thirst of sinners speaks of the Savior&rsquo;s thirst. The satisfaction of sinners speaks of the Savior&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<p>Are you not thirsty deep within? Are you satisfied with your human life? Without the Lord, you have no satisfaction, and without you the Lord has no satisfaction. The Lord is waiting for you to receive Him so that you may be satisfied and so that He too may be satisfied. Do not disappoint Him and do not remain thirsty forever!</p>
