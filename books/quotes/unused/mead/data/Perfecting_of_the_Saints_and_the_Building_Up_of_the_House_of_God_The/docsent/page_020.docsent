   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>USING REFERENCE BOOKS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The brothers who minister the word must not merely collect some points from reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If our speaking consists of only what we collect from reference books, the words that we speak will not come from our experience of God and will not pass through God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean that reference books are useless, nor does it mean that we should not use them, but the words that we speak must pass through God, and they must have the element of the experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Making the Vision and Experience of Others</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Vision and Experience</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the use of reference books?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Good reference books contain some light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An example is Andrew Murray s The Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a valuable reference book because Andrew Murray was enlightened and saw the truth concerning abiding in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we read this book, however, we should not treat it as a reference book.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to speak it to others, we need to pass through God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Otherwise, we are those who buy and sell goods ; we have not passed through God, and we have no experience that comes out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not mean that we should not read reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, instead of merely quoting a book, we should bring the content what the author saw and experienced to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the content will become our vision and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to see what the author saw and experience what the author experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the book is not merely a reference book.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We read reference books because we want to see what others saw and experience what they experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we will have something that is in God and has passed through God; their vision will become our vision, and their experience, our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the primary purpose of reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For a Proper Understanding</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of Words and Phrases</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Reference books also help us study the meaning of words and phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not thoroughly understand the original language, it is difficult to determine the proper translation of some words and phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, we can consult reference books written by people who understand the language.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this respect reference books are useful, and we should use them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the words and phrases that we study should help us in our utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finding Proper Utterance</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Reference books can help us with our utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes the authors have good utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, we should not accept everything that is in a reference book.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, Madame Guyon spoke about being lost in God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is good utterance, but it is not sufficiently high or clear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seems as though Madame Guyon used these words to mean being blended and mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we say that we are lost in God, it implies that we no longer exist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, according to our experience, we are mingled with God, not lost in God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, reference books should merely be used for consultation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should not quote everything that is written.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reference books that we read should inspire us to develop our phrases and utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our use of reference books can be compared to a commander-in-chief who consults his advisers for their opinions in order to develop a strategy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes these opinions give us good ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not read or consult reference books, we limit ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The reference books that we consult can be helpful in improving our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we should not wait until we are about to give a message to consult a reference book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we should read reference books regularly in order to gain a resource of material.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, the books concerning fellowship between man and God by Andrew Murray, Madame Guyon, and Mrs. Penn-Lewis have their own characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We therefore should not wait until we are about to speak on fellowship with God before we consult these reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The proper way is to read these books on a regular basis and store what we read within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then when we are ready to give a message on fellowship with God, there will be a foundation within us, because we have consulted what others wrote.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should use what they wrote as reference material, but we should not quote everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the way to use reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Avoiding the Exposition of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>in Reference Books</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, when we use reference books, we must not rely on their expositions of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should never think that we can quote someone merely because he expounded a verse in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do, our speaking will not be the word of the ministry, because it did not pass through God and does not have the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, our speaking is borrowed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whether we give messages or lead others to study the Bible, this is an inappropriate way to use reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The words that we speak must pass through God and must be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can consult what others write in order to understand the meaning of phrases and words in the Bible, and the light that others receive from the Bible may inspire us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, what we speak must be in God, and it must pass through God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The words that we speak must also be spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can be helped in our utterance without quoting everything we read.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to study, learn, and consider what others write.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we will be more advanced and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I received much help from the writings of Mr. J. N. Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is a statement in his writings that I believe is a great word, even though some people may consider it insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He said that the Psalms are the expressions, feelings, and impressions of godly men.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Most people would think this is an ordinary word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Darby s Synopsis of the Books of the Bible he commented on all one hundred fifty psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Many important statements can be found in his comments.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, except for the statement of the Psalms being the expressions, feelings, and impressions of godly men, I consider his comments to be ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Psalms are the expressions and feelings of godly men.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I was helped by this crucial word because it opened up the book of Psalms to me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the Life-study Training on the Psalms in 1956, I strongly disagreed with one of Darby s interpretations.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Darby said that Christ is the One who meditates on the law of Jehovah day and night, but I cannot agree with this interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Psalm 1 is the speaking of a godly person who has the law as his background.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In Psalm 2 there is another person who lives before God and who, through the Spirit of God, speaks something that is contrary to Psalm 1.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Instead of regarding the law, this person exalts the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I did not agree with Darby s view regarding Psalm 1, but I agree with Darby s statement that the Psalms are the expressions and feelings of godly men.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The contents of these expressions, however, require much discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, we should limit our use of reference books to the ways that we have described.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should not accept everything indiscriminately.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There will be problems if we rely excessively on reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even the book The Spirit of Christ by Andrew Murray will be dead letters if we merely quote it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The words that we speak must pass through God and must be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The light that others receive can inspire us, and we can be helped with the meaning of words and with our utterance, but we must never take what others say as ours.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What we speak must pass through God and must be in God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The usefulness of reference books depends upon how we use them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If we do not know how to properly use them, we will be led into a forest filled with trees of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We may feel that the trees are good, but the fruit that they bear is called knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we are controlled by the vision of Genesis 2 and know how to properly use reference books, we will realize that most reference books are trees of knowledge that are full of all kinds of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In summary, we need to learn how to use reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>These books can give us good impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In addition, before we give a message, we may fellowship with a young brother who seemingly speaks nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But our utterance is improved by the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We should never blindly receive what others write; otherwise, we will be led into a forest of trees of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We can use the books for reference, but we should not quote them blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Most of the expositions of the Bible that were written over the past two thousand years have not been much help to us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They were merely references.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Most books on exposition are related to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Few books are related to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Besides Darby, F. W. Grant was a great expositor of the Bible among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But many of the expositions in his book The Numerical Bible are on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; they focus on knowledge, not life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This does not mean that his expositions are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Whether a reference book is beneficial depends on how it is used.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Reference books should be used as a source of reference.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We should not quote them in their entirety; otherwise, the issue will not be life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We have to grasp this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The words that we speak must be spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If we keep this principle, we can use reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Some brothers like to use Bible handbooks, which give information related to history or geography, but they are not of much value.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>What we can give the brothers and sisters from these books is worse than the carob pods that the prodigal son in Luke 15 ate; it is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Some brothers say that since we do not know the background of the Bible, we can use a Bible handbook to learn, for example, where the book of Ephesians was written, where the city of Ephesus was located, and what its population was.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This information is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When we eat of this tree, our eyes are opened, but we do not touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>There is no loss if we do not know this information.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>On the contrary, if we know these things, we will suffer loss, because when we speak on the book of Ephesians, we will tell people only about the size of the city of Ephesus and how large its population was.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>What is the benefit of having such information?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we needed to know these things, God would have written about them in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Since He did not write about them, why do we need to spend time on them?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>It is possible not to know where the book of Ephesians was written but still supply the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We can say that according to the riches of His glory, God is strengthening the saints through His Spirit into their inner man that Christ may make His home in their hearts that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God 3:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Even if what we say seems a little confusing, we need to transfuse Christ into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We can say that Christ wants to make His home in our hearts through faith so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God and even become the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We can also say that God is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us v. 20 . This is what we need to say to the saints when we speak on the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>There is no need to speak about the size of the city, its population, or who the governor was.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>In my youth I also liked to read Bible handbooks; however, one day I threw them away.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>There is more than enough of value in the Word of God than we can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The word that we minister must not be knowledge, doctrine, or even explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>It must be the utterance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>If we keep this principle, we can use numerous reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>I never saw anyone use reference books as much as Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Before Brother Nee spoke on the Gospel of Matthew, he consulted almost all the commentaries on Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>However, he never gave a message that came from a book.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>He often said that there was nothing in the reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Everything depends on whether we know how to use these books.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>For example, a young brother may not give a clear word concerning prayer, but what he says can draw out words from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Then when we speak, we are able to use the words of the brother and minister a clear word concerning prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We use what the brother said as reference material.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>If we use everything in a reference book, what we minister will not pass through God.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>The brothers who minister the word must speak a word that is spirit and life, has passed through God, and is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We must keep this basic principle in the ministry of the word.</S>
