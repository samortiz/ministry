C.</h2><p>I was born into a non-Christian family, and it was difficult for me to be saved. While I was in my office one day, I asked out of curiosity if there was ever a man on earth who never lied. My boss told me that only Christians do not lie. I began to look for such ones in Christianity. Later I was saved in a China Inland Mission church. I became a seeking Christian and subscribed to The Christian as well as The Present Testimony. At the same time, I wanted to become rich, and the Lord had to stop me through an illness. By then I had been saved for two years already. After I returned home, my sickness went away, and I began to work in the Bible Society, hoping to have an opportunity to go to college and later to study in America. But the Lord caused me to become sick again, this time almost unto death. He showed me that the the world is about to pass away. I told the Lord, "I will crave the things in the world no longer." When I said this, my sickness went away. I intended to go to Chefoo to recuperate, but I wanted to take up a teaching job in order to spend time studying the Bible. Soon my school colleagues rallied together against me. One day I felt that they had insulted me too much. I lost my temper and hit some of them. They hit back, and there was a brawl. At that time Brother Witness Lee came to Chefoo and started the Lord's table, and I had already broken bread with the brothers there. I was overjoyed. But the school increased my work so that I could not go to the meetings. The Lord gave me a word, and I quit my job. Later I began to serve the Lord together with Brother Witness in the church in Chefoo. In 1940 I went to Shanghai and received some training. At that time I had tuberculosis and became sick again. I am like a piece of decayed wood that cannot be carved. For the past few years I have been downtrodden. I lost all interest in the work, my health deteriorated, and I became quite depressed. It is the Lord's mercy that I can come up to the mountain this time. As far as my health is concerned, I cannot even walk around. Thank the Lord that I saw something through the messages on Thursday and Friday. I am no longer struggling to climb up. This will only become a hindrance to me. I ask the brothers and sisters to pray for me.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">The Lord as the Center</h2><p>Many times a man suffers unexpected sickness. Many people think that the Lord will protect their health as long as they are working for Him. Since they have wasted themselves in His service, they think that He surely will preserve them. One day I became gravely ill and was vomiting blood. This came as a great surprise to me. I did not understand God's reason for doing this to me, and I fell into darkness. Perhaps it was because I did not follow the law of the physical body. But it also could have been God's dealing with me to remove my trust in myself. In 2 Corinthians 1 Paul spoke of his afflictions in Asia. He was excessively burdened, even to the point where he despaired of living, having the judgment of death in himself. (Response of death can be rendered "judgment of death" in the original language.) Although this death has yet to be executed, the judgment has been pronounced already. Paul realized that this was so that we would not "base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead" (v. 9b). How strict the apostle was in dealing with his self-love! With many people, as soon as they have an inkling of the judgment of death (such as being found with tuberculosis or vomiting blood), they are decimated, and they sink subconsciously into self-love. Actually, our whole life is a journey towards death. Even as we are sleeping in our bed we are walking towards death. Of course, the reality of death does not come to us until we experience such sicknesses as tuberculosis. Then it seems as if a death pronouncement has been made on us; we sense the transience of human life, and everything seems to be finished.</p><p>When a man is at his critical hour, death becomes real to him. His self-love is severely threatened. Even his own life is at risk. At such times his future hinges on how he reacts to the blows. He may lose his future and everything else. Many times a question will arise in him: "What do I really believe? What am I hoping to receive?" If our faith is based on our physical life, we will only find spiritual respite and faith when our physical life revives. Subconsciously, this means that our physical life has become the center of our being; even our spiritual life is something ancillary. The result of making our own life the center is that every spiritual thing in us leaks away at critical junctures. They leak away like water leaking from a broken barrel. The best test of what is our center occurs when the Lord threatens our life a little. If the natural life is the center, we forget all spiritual work and service because we are about to die. If our natural life has become our center, it is good that God smites us because we have built up a wrong center in ourselves.</p><p>We should center everything around the spiritual things of God. Our center should not be our physical life. The result of having a wrong center is losing everything. Suppose a widow only has one son. She has consecrated herself to the Lord, along with her only son. If her son dies, her consecration will be greatly tested. She will feel as if the floor has collapsed under her. She will say, "All of my prayer, trust, and consecration have come to nothing." This immediately shows that her whole life has been revolving around her only son. The same can be said of our physical life. If we have centers other than the Lord, our true nature will be exposed as soon as these centers are threatened.</p><p>Basically a Christian should be clear where his center lies. The subconscious center of many people is themselves. If their center is the spiritual life and the Lord, it will not matter whether ten physical lives are lost. When we become sick, we should not ask for recovery. Instead, we should let go of the matter. There is no need to worry or hope for anything. If our life fails, let it fail. We have to confess humbly that our center has been wrong. We have to turn back to the Lord and acknowledge Him as our only hope. Every saint should learn this basic lesson. We should find out whether or not our center is Christ. Actually, we may have many centers in addition to Christ. We can ask God why He is not merciful to us and why He deals with us as He does. However, we will realize that our center is not the Lord but ourselves only when death is knocking at our door. This is the reason you cannot rise up. You have to discard all the things that contribute to your self-centeredness. Now is not the time to recover your faith and work. Your center is wrong. If you recover your former faith, service, and zeal, it will not do you any good. The Lord's purpose is to remove your very person. Many people do not touch God's center, and they hold on to everything. This is wrong. You should say to God, "I thank You. I can let go of everything. The God whom I serve is still the Yes. God, let everything that can fall fall! Let everything that can be removed be removed! Even if something can be recovered, I do not want it. If this thing has not passed through death, what good will it do me to seek after it? God, my life is in Your hand. I will let go of everything!"</p><p>No human worry will resurrect you. No human hope will resurrect you. The only One who can resurrect you is the Lord. If your center is the Lord, your course will be straight. The Lord is everything! May the Lord deliver you out of other centers. Some workers have the work as their center. How foolish this is! The work is not the center. Nothing is the center. A man cannot have any center other than the Lord. The Lord alone is the center. Only this will give you the full rest. Any center apart from the Lord will be destroyed by Him. Do not think that this is cruel. This is your protection; it keeps you on the straight pathway. You should have no center other than the Lord. His hand is gradually destroying everything other than Himself. He will not allow anything else to remain. Ephesians 1:10 says, "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him." Unless the Lord becomes your very center, you cannot serve Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
