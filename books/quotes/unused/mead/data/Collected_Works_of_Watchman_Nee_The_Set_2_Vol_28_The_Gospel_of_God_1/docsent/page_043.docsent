   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION NOT BEING FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE WORKS OF LAW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first question is whether man is saved through faith with the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man's way for salvation is faith plus the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have spoken concerning the question of the law already, but we will repeat it again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible devotes much time to deal with this question.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Preachers, therefore, must also devote much time to deal with this question.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because man pays so much attention to the law, the Bible devotes two books to deal with this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to know for what purpose God has given the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God gave the Israelites the law, not for them to keep, but for exposing their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Originally, the Israelites had sins, but they had not become transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From Adam to Moses, man had sins Rom 5:14 , but he did not have any transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God gave the law in order to turn man's sins into transgressions Rom 5:13, 20a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How were man's sins turned into transgressions?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose there is a person who has the disposition and temperament of walking back and forth outside the meeting hall every day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is something that he likes to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has to do this every day, every week, every month, and every year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one can explain why he does this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in his temperament, disposition, and life, there is something that compels him to walk back and forth outside the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although he has such a habit, we cannot say that he has any transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may not like what he does, and you may think that it is wrong, but he has no realization that this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When will he realize that it is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose you take two bright red ribbons and tie one to each end of the lane.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he comes the next day, he will see the two ribbons and will realize that he should not walk through them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His habit has always been to walk there because something in him compels him to walk there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose he takes a look at the two ribbons and considers the bright color, the silk texture, the nice knots, and then tears them apart and walks right through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In that case, his walking is different from his previous walking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His previous walking was sin without transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now it is the same walking, but he walks in transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God says that the law is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is good, righteous, holy, and excellent Rom 7:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But man is full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is full of sin within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, from Adam to Moses, man had no transgressions although he had sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God established the law, not in order that man would not sin, but in order to expose man's sins and make them transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the law is here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once a person breaks the law, he realizes that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we can say that God gave man the law not for him to keep, but for him to see that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When there was no law, he did not realize that he has sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now he knows.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The strange thing is that man takes the law, which is there to prove his sin, to try to prove that he is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He turns the law around.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants us to know through the law that we have sinned, but we want to prove through the law that we are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God wants to show us through the law that we are perishing, but we want to prove through the law that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man does not see himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His thoughts are full of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He does not see that he is corrupt inside and cannot keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man's flesh cannot keep God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It will not submit to God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, man still wants to seek out righteousness from the law and earn life through it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God uses the law to show man that he is helpless and that he needs to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But when man sees the ordinances, he tries to earn a little righteousness through them and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 3:19 says, "Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here it says that the law was given for the purpose of stopping every mouth, so that no one can say anything, and so that everyone can be subject to the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Following this, there is a verdict concerning us: "Because out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for through the law is the clear knowledge of sin" v. 20 . One can see that the original intention of the law was to expose sin; it was not to justify man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is so clear that the purpose of God's law was to expose sin rather than to establish our own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the Old Testament, not only did God give man the law, He gave man the types as well.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These were the ceremonial laws.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They explained how to offer up sacrifices and how to pay the money for atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These matters typify the Lord Jesus' accomplishment of redemption and its subsequent salvation for us in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is what God has shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is so strange that man would try to establish his own righteousness not only through the law, but also through these types.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He tries to establish his righteousness through these ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We even find a Pharisee praying that he fasted twice a week and that he offered to God one tenth of what he had Luke 18:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He thought that these were his righteousnesses and that through them he could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Man does not see the purpose for which God established the law.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He misunderstands God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Man doubts if it is that easy to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He thinks that it is true that man is indeed saved through believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We who are Christians all the more acknowledge the need to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is right to believe, but many say that we should also keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What man is saying today is not whether one can be saved through the law or not.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What he is saying is that those who believe in Jesus should also keep the law before they can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Faith in Jesus is an undisputed doctrine in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But Christians say that one should add to that the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Man does not see that to believe in Jesus and to keep the law are two absolutely contradictory things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They can never be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The difference between faith in Jesus and work in the law is the difference between heaven and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As heaven is vastly different from hell, so faith in Jesus is vastly different from the work of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>To whom was the law given?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It was given to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Why then does the New Testament mention again and again the keeping of the law?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the New Testament, the apostles, or we should say the Holy Spirit, knew clearly that the readers of it may not necessarily all be Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only a minority of those who believed in Jesus at the very beginning were Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>One person asked me once, "You say that the Jews were the ones to receive the law.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But who are the Jews?"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I told him that the Jews were like guinea pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When a researcher of pharmaceutical products is not sure of a drug, he does not experiment with humans.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Instead, he first injects it into guinea pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If the guinea pigs die, then the drug cannot be used.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Only after the drug is proven effective will it be injected into human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The same is done for oral drugs.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>First, it is taken in by guinea pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If it works, then the drug is used.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Otherwise it is discarded.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The same is done for immunization against bacteria.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If it works on guinea pigs, it will work on man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If it does not work on guinea pigs, it will not work on man.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I would say in a most respectful way that the Jews are the guinea pigs.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God tried out the law on the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If the Jews could make it, then it could be used.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If they could not make it, then it cannot be used.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>God did try the law on the Jews, and they did not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This means that the whole world cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Jews were selected by God as objects of an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Jews are representative of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Hence, one sees that the law was officially given to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But the principle of the law is given to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is given to all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>God gave man the law to forewarn him that man is of the flesh and is fleshly.</S>
