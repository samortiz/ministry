   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Making Appointments by Selling Something</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some of you can get the best product that can be sold door to door.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then you go out, not to preach Christ but as a salesman.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most people would open the door for a salesman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You should sell the product very cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You can show them that you get only five percent discount, and you would give this five percent to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the deal is made, you say, "I sold this to you so cheap because I am not for selling; I am for preaching Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Give them one of your name cards, and ask for a few minutes to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most buyers would give you some time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then after a little talk, you can make an appointment to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is another way to reach people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gaining Entrance to Closed Neighborhoods</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one's door is closed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>People open their doors nearly every day, but we must find a way to keep them open.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One brother told us that he visited an upper-middle-class community, and no one would open their door because no one knew him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So he began to visit that neighborhood regularly, not to knock on doors but simply to walk back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of the residents saw him quite often in that neighborhood, and eventually someone talked to him and opened to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you can get one person to invite you into his home, after two or three weeks, some others may also be open to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another way to reach people is to form a singing team of about six saints and go to an upper-class community.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sing proper Christmas songs throughout the neighborhood at about seven o'clock in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Maybe they would be eating or just finishing their dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then go the second night and sing again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Go every night for one week and see what will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may not need to knock on any doors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some will come out and say: "You have nice singing, marvelous singing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all like it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We would like to know who you are."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By this way, some doors will be opened to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Way of Faithfulness and Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not be bound to any one way in our gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord will not lead us in only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Luke 14, first the lord charged his servant to go to the streets and lanes of the city v. 21 . The servant came back and said, "What you have commanded has been done, and still there is room" v. 22 . Then his lord said, "Go out into the roads and hedges" v. 23 . The Lord is flexible, and He changes His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To visit and talk to people is much easier on the streets and in the lanes of the city than on the roads, the highways.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To whom can we talk on the highway?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We could wait there for someone to run out of gasoline and stop right in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That would be a good chance to talk to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are wise, we would have prepared some water so we can say: "Sir, are you thirsty?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have some water."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may think, "How could I meet a person in this way every week?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in fifty-two weeks, we can meet one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we go out once a week to stand beside the highway just waiting for someone to run out of gas, for fifty-two weeks, we can be sure we will meet one person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even if we do not meet one, the Lord will surely consider us to be faithful servants.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must also pray, "O Lord, send me one."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord will answer us; He will send us one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This dear one who was driving the car may have his cousin with him, so we will also meet his cousin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Preaching out of Necessity</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One thing is for sure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we stay at home, we will gain nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been at home for years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who did we reach with the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is worthwhile for us to pursue any way by which we can minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, our crucial need is not a way but a desperation to gain someone for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must be desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not tolerate our barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not bear fruit, the Lord will cut us off from His enjoyment, and He will judge and punish us at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a necessity that we preach the gospel, for woe unto us if we do not 1 Cor 9:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are desperate, surely the Lord will give us a saved sinner to offer up as a sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If all the saints had been practicing the door-knocking since it was introduced in 1986, I believe all the churches would have doubled by now, but the Devil has been working to damage the saints and destroy their faith by putting doubt into their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must tell the Devil that we do not have the time nor the ear to hear all this nonsensical talk.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We would rather be desperate and go out to reach people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I believe our Lord, the Lord whom we serve, will be happy to see this.</S>
