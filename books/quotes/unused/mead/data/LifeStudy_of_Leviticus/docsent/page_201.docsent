   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Sabbath Produce of the Land to Be Food for All Kinds of People and for the Cattle and the Animals</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"The sabbath produce of the land shall be food for you, for your male and female slaves, for your hired servant, and for the sojourner who lives with you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For your cattle also and for the animals that are in your land, all its produce shall be for food" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This signifies that it is all a matter of grace toward anyone, regardless of his status.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the seventh year the produce of the land became common.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the land still belonged to its owners, what the land produced belonged to everyone, to every kind of person, and even to the cattle and all the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the produce of the land was common.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may say that this is God's communism, a communism that results from the grace of God and that makes us rich, not the human communism that is forced upon people and makes them poor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this common enjoyment of the produce of the land, there is real freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>D. God Commanding His Blessing in the Sixth Year so that the Land Would Yield a Crop Sufficient for Three Years</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"If you should say, What shall we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our crops?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then I will command My blessing on you in the sixth year, so that it will yield a sufficient crop for three years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you sow in the eighth year, you will eat of the old crop until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you will eat the old" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This signifies that the sufficient grace of God surpasses our need threefold.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Forced communism is against God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to God's will, we should have a proper enjoyment of all things that are in common.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The possession of the land is not common, for the land still belongs to each owner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is common is the produce of the land in the seventh year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this year everything produced by the land becomes common for the purpose of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this purpose, God blesses the land to produce food threefold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This practice of keeping the sabbath year ushers us into the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE JUBILEE THE PENTECOSTAL YEAR</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Young's Concordance, the Hebrew word for jubilee means a time of shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This shouting is, of course, not of mourning but of rejoicing; it is a joyful shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God realized that in ancient times there was, economically speaking, the need for natural resources to be balanced among the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After the Israelites entered into the good land, the land was divided among them by lots.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>None of these lots was to be sold permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, in the year of jubilee any lots that had been sold were to be returned to the original owners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During the years before the jubilee, some of the people might not have been able to keep their property.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of poverty or illness they might have been forced to sell their property in whole or in part.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, at the time of jubilee, at the time of shouting, the land reverted to its owner.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This return of the land was God's way of balancing the ownership of land among the people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus there could not be any landlords, for in God's wisdom the divine regulation, the divine ordinance, was a balance of the natural resources.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This ordinance was to be put into effect every fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From this we see that thirty-five centuries ago, a long time before Marx invented communism, God made provision in the holy Word for the balance of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every fifty years, without the original owners doing anything or paying anything, the land was returned to them and once again became their possession.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In type, the jubilee portrays our situation as poor sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our situation was that the longer we lived, the more we lost of our divinely allotted portion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we lived in a sinful way, we lost the divine rights.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we committed sin, the more of these rights we lost.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, we sold all that we had inherited by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We even lost ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We sold ourselves not to a proper buyer but to Satan and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was the reason Paul could say, "I am fleshly, sold under sin" Rom 7:14b .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Lake Paul, we also were slaves sold to sin; we had lost to Satan our rights.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not consider Satan and sin two separate things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, when we sold ourselves to sin, we sold ourselves to Satan and thus fell into the hands of Satan under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As descendants of Adam, we all had sold the rights allotted to us by God and even sold ourselves to sin and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, we could do nothing about our situation; we did not have the means to redeem ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We were hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then one day, jubilee came.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Luke 4:18 and 19 the Lord Jesus proclaimed the jubilee with words of grace see Life-study of Luke, Messages Twelve and Sixty-four through Sixty-nine .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When He came, jubilee came with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ has accomplished the full redemption of God for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now when we preach the gospel, we make a proclamation of the New Testament jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The jubilee is not a Pentecostal day but a Pentecostal year.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The principle is the same here as with the sabbath year.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Elsewhere we read of the sabbath day, but in Leviticus 25 we have the sabbath year.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Likewise, elsewhere Pentecost is a day, but here we have the Pentecostal year.</S>
