   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT EXPERIENCING THE SEVEN LAMPS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SEVEN EYES,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE SEVEN SPIRITS GOD S BUILDING, THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In eternity past, the unique Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, existed by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 1:26 reveals that God came in to create man in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although man was created in the image of God, at the time of creation, man did not have the life of God in him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we read through the entire Bible from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22, we see that after many dispensations, generations, and centuries have passed, God will still be there in eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, He will no longer be by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although He will still be the Triune God, pictured in 22:1 as God, the Lamb, and the flowing river the symbol of the Spirit , at that time He will be the center of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In eternity past, God was by Himself, but in eternity future, the Triune God will be the center of the New Jerusalem and will saturate the whole city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The portrait of the New Jerusalem in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two is a sign signifying that God will be mingled with His redeemed people as His enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, this people will be a building.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This building, constituted with divinity and humanity, will be a mutual habitation of both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the transparent revelation of the Holy Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This revelation includes three main items: the unique God, the created man, and the builded New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These three items cover the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God comes into man, regenerates him, and transforms him, He mingles Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By mingling Himself with man, God becomes enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The issue of this mingling is the building, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the New Jerusalem as God s building is the mingling of God with the created, redeemed, and regenerated man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all need to have a vision of this marvelous building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BROUGHT INTO GOD S UNCHANGING BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Recently, a brother testified that since the time he was saved, he has undergone many changes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For a while he would be happy, and then there would be a change.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At one point he thought he had come into the victorious life, but then things changed once again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But consider how many changes there have been and will be from the time of Adam until the time of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The reason you have experienced so many changes is that you have not yet been brought into God s unchanging building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Until we all have been brought into God s building, we all shall continue to change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only after we have come into His building will there be no further change.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 3:12 says, He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that only after we have been built into the temple of God shall we cease to change.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the meantime, the more we change, the closer we are to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our eternal destiny is to be in God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, among most Christians today there is no building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, there is continual wandering and shifting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THIRTEEN ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the book of Genesis there are eight important men: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, these eight men issued in God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Old Testament this building was typified by the tabernacle and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the New Testament we have the reality of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jesus is the tabernacle John 1:14, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>, the church is the temple 1 Cor 3:16 , and the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Altogether there are thirteen items: the eight men in Genesis, the tabernacle and the temple in type, Jesus and the church in reality, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
