   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Interceding at the Risk of His Eternal Destiny</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moses sought to make propitiation for the people even at the risk of his eternal destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to verse 32, he said to the Lord, And now, if You will forgive their sin and if not, wipe me out, I pray, from Your book which You have written.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Notice that Moses did not complete the first part of his statement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He simply said, If You will forgive their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we had been Moses, we may have said something like this: Now, if You will forgive their sin, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moses, however, left the matter open.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To indicate this, some translations use an ellipsis and say, If You will forgive their sin....</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes it is necessary to speak in this way to those close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In speaking to our husband or wife we may need to say, If you will do this....</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not always complete our thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moses spoke in such a way because he realized that he was not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the Lord is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, Moses did not presume to say what would be the result or consequence if the Lord forgave their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The latter part of Moses word in verse 32 makes it clear that he was propitiating for the people at the risk of his spiritual destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said to the Lord, If not, wipe me out, I pray, from Your book which You have written.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems that Moses was saying, Concerning my own destiny, Lord, I would ask you to wipe me out if you would not forgive this people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But I leave with You the question concerning the destiny of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only you can say what their destiny should be.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you think that Moses word in verses 31 and 32 is an ordinary prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not pray in an ordinary way for the children of Israel; instead, he conversed with God intimately in their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That was the wise way followed by Moses to appease God in that situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to God s Heart</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses made propitiation for the people according to God s heart 32:33 33:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From what the Lord says in verse 33, apparently He did not heed Moses word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outwardly it may seem that God resisted Moses word, but inwardly He had already honored it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God was happy to have such a companion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God may have said to Himself, I am glad to have Moses for a companion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is intimate with Me, and He knows My heart and what I want to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moses knows that I want to forgive this people and continue to use them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, I would not initiate this conversation in their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But Moses, My companion, one who knows My heart, has initiated this talk.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 33 God said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against Me, I will wipe him out from My book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This word was an outward expression to uphold God s honor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But what the Lord goes on to say in verse 34 indicates that He had forgiven the people: And now, go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Behold, My angel shall go before you, and in the day of My visitation I will visit their sin upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moses, the mediator, realized that God s word here was an indication that He had forgiven the people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moses had said, If You will forgive their sin....</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seems that he was saying to the Lord, Lord, I won t say anything further.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You speak a word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now You tell me to go lead the people to the place of which You have spoken to me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have no problem with this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The King James Version and Darby s translation capitalize the word angel in verse 34.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I agree with this, for it is an indication that the angel here is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord promised Moses that His angel would go before him, and in the day of His visitation He would visit the people s sin upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the one hand, the people were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But on the other hand, there was still a problem, and God said that He would deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes the relationship between a father and his children is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The children may do something wrong, and the father will forgive them and release them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, he may intend to deal with them in some way at a later time.</S>
