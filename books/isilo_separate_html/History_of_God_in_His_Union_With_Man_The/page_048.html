Not Speaking to Abraham for Thirteen Years</H2><P>God did not speak to Abraham for thirteen years because he took Hagar as his concubine, who brought forth for him a son, Ishmael, when he was eighty-six years old (Gen. 16). Abraham offended God, his Friend. Thus, God would not fellowship with Abraham for thirteen years. Genesis 16:16 says, "And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram." Then Genesis 17:1 says, "And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram..." This shows that for thirteen years there was not any communication, fellowship, or speaking between God and Abraham.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Appearing the Seventh Time to Abraham<br>When He Was Ninety-nine Years Old</H2><P>God appeared the seventh time to Abraham when he was ninety-nine years old and made with him the covenant of circumcision so that he would be the father of a multitude of nations. He also changed his name from Abram to Abraham and his wife's name from Sarai to Sarah, of whom Abraham would have a son, Isaac (Gen. 17). The covenant of circumcision is a sign. All the chosen ones of God should be circumcised, meaning that they should cut off, crucify, their flesh (Gal. 5:24). The body of the flesh should be cut off, crucified (Col. 2:11), to regenerate us and renew us, making us a new person. Abraham was living a model of the Christian life, because the covenant of circumcision signifies that he was crucified, regenerated, and renewed. This was so that he would be the father of a multitude of nations.</P><P>Furthermore, his name and his wife's name were changed from Abram and Sarai to Abraham and Sarah. Because the person is changed, the name should also be changed. Eventually, Sarah gave birth to Isaac. This means that after we have been crucified and regenerated, we will bring forth the real seed. Otherwise, we will produce Ishmael. If we are not crucified, regenerated, and renewed, we cannot produce Isaac. We will produce false Christians, not the real believers. We can produce the real believers only by being circumcised, that is, by being crucified, regenerated, and renewed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Appearing the Eighth Time<br>to Him by the Oaks of Mamre</H2><P>God appeared the eighth time to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, fellowshipping with him as with His friend (Gen. 18; 2 Chron. 20:7; Isa. 41:8; James 2:23). In the past I wondered why God came with two angels to visit and stay with Abraham. God conversed with Abraham. Abraham served Him water for Him to wash His feet, and Abraham's wife made a meal for Him. God talked with Abraham as a friend. Abraham saw God, conversed with God, and walked with God. Then God was forced to tell him what He was about to do to Sodom. God indicated that He could not hide this from Abraham because Abraham was His intimate friend. Actually, God's purpose and intention in coming to visit Abraham was for Lot's sake.</P><P>God told Abraham what He was about to do to Sodom with the intention that Abraham would intercede. God was motivating Abraham to pray for Lot. Actually, God and Abraham, as close friends, were speaking of Lot but they did not mention Lot's name. Eventually, Lot was saved from Sodom, meaning that God answered Abraham's prayer. Genesis 19:29 says that when God destroyed Sodom, He remembered Abraham and sent Lot out. That means He answered Abraham's intercession. This shows that our living the Christian life must be to the extent that we become God's friend and God becomes our Friend.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> </body></html>
