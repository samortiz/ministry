   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE UNIQUE ONENESS FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: John 10:16; 17:21-23; 1 Cor 1:5, 7a, 10-13, 22-24; 2:1-2; Eph 4:3-6; Titus 3:10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapters we saw the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every building must have a site.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without a site building is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we will see what the site for the building up of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament the unique site for building the church is the unique oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This unique oneness is the site, the ground, for us to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>ONENESS IN LIFE, NATURE, POSITION, AND EXPRESSION IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN The Folds and One Flock</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both the Gospels and the Epistles speak about the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first mention of oneness in the New Testament is by the Lord Himself in John 10:16, which says, "And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one Shepherd."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The King James Version renders the latter part of verse 16 as, "there shall be one fold, and one shepherd."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The latter mention of the word fold in this verse is actually the word flock in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A fold is a place which holds the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It has nothing to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a place of shelter or a fenced area to protect the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The flock, however, is not a place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The flock is something living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The flock is the collection of all the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today the wrong teaching in traditional Christianity says that the church is a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, we say that a backslider is a person who is away from the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This teaching is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A fold is a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Judaism was a fold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before the Lord Jesus came, God used the law as a fold to hold His people Gal 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord Jesus came, however, He opened the door of the law, the door of Judaism, not only for people to go in but also for them to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ Being the Door In and Out of the Fold</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 10:9 says, "I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to be very careful in dealing with the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The order of the words in this verse is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It says that the saved one will "go in and go out."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What does go in mean?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some have said that this is going into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If this were true, then the phrase go out which follows means that someone can go out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The door in verse 9 is not the door to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When I was young, I was taught that Jesus in John 10 was the door for us to enter into the heavens, but this is absolutely a wrong teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In John 10, Jesus is not the door of the heavens; He is the door of the fold which is Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before the Lord Jesus came, God used the law as a fold to hold His people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even in the Old Testament, Christ was the door for God's people to enter into the fold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all of the prophets entered the fold through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They were God's people, God's sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament, Christ was the door for all God's people to go into Judaism to be held there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then in John 10, Christ came as the door for all these sheep to come out of the fold of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ was the door for His people to go in, and He is the door for His people to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First we go into the fold, and then we go out.</S>
