   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Boundary of a Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Being Bigger than the Locality</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is also wrong for a church to be bigger than the boundary of its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please read your Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible speaks of "the churches of Galatia" 1 Cor 16:1 , "the churches of Asia" v. 19 , and "the churches of Judea" Gal 1:22 . In Judea there were many localities with churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why we refer to them as the churches of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We see this in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the book of Galatians we see "the churches of Galatia."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Revelation 1:4 we see "the...churches which are in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After reading these portions of the Scripture, we should be quite clear about what the Bible says concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No church is ever bigger than a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Galatia was a province in the Roman Empire; it was not a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is why the Bible does not say, "The church of Galatia," but, "The churches of Galatia."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There were several churches in Galatia.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why the plural word churches is used instead of the singular church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, it is wrong for a church to be bigger than its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible does not say, "the church in Asia," but "the seven churches which are in Asia"!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea were all localities in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These seven places did not become one united church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They remained seven churches in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is wrong for a church to be bigger than its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These seven churches did not become one big church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same principle, we see "the churches of Judea" because at that time Judea was a province of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Originally, it was a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, it became a province.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the province of Judea there were many localities with churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They could not be combined together to become one church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must see that God ordains to have only "the church in Foochow"; there cannot be an "XXX church in Foochow."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Having this would make the church smaller than its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Neither can anyone unite all the churches in the province of Fukien and make them one church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can only have "the churches in Fukien," not "the church in Fukien"; to have such would make the church bigger than its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>C. The Church Bearing</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only the Name of the Locality</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers, we must be clear that the church cannot be named after a person, a doctrine, a system, or the place of its origin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It should be identified only by the name of its locality, not the name of its place of origin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There can only be "the church in Foochow"; there cannot be "the church of Shanghai in Foochow."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You cannot have the Roman Church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Roman Church has to go back to Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If some believers from the church in Rome come to Shanghai, they can be part of the church in Shanghai, but they cannot set up a Roman Church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The place of origin cannot be brought to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Anglican Church should go back to England.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Anglican believers that come to Shanghai should become the believers in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They should not bring the Anglican Church to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church can only be local.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His Word, God has ordained that the church should be divided only according to locality, not nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There should not be any Chinese Church or Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There can only be the church in London and the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They are only localities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Churches are based on locality, not nationality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no such thing as "the Church of Christ in China" in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There should not be any distinction of people, nationality, or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's Word only allows one kind of distinction according to locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Wherever you are, you are a member of the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you want to change your church, you have to change your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If I am in Foochow, and I cannot get along with a brother, there is only one way for me to leave the church in Foochow I have to leave Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God only recognizes the difference of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He does not recognize any other difference.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I hope you will receive God's mercy to see that there is only one church and that the church is local.</S>
