   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS AND GIFTS TO THE BODY Scripture Reading: Psa 68:18; Eph 4:7, 8, 11-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The previous seven chapters on the meal offering cover five major points.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first point concerns the significance of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that the meal offering is a present to God of the humanity of Jesus which we have experienced, enjoyed, and appreciated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, the meal offering constitutes worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Third, the meal offering affords priestly food for the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fourth, the meal offering not only constitutes worship to God and affords food for the priesthood, but also produces standing boards, which are the main structure of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By feeding on the meal offering, all the priests become the standing boards.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fifth, the meal offering forms the tabernacle by uniting all the boards together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GIFTED PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sixth point is very deep and difficult to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is perhaps the deepest aspect of the meal offering; it concerns the making of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gifts in Ephesians 4 are not abilities, but the gifted persons, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These are not skills or abilities; these are persons gifted with skills and abilities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, Ephesians 4:11-16 reveals that not only are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers gifts to the Body, but every member of the Body is a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consider your own body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every member of your body is a gift to your body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not think that only Paul the Apostle was a gift to the Body and you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps Paul was an arm, but you may be at least a little finger.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The arm is a gift to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regardless of how small we are, even less than the least, we are still gifts to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 4 speaks of the effectual working in the measure of every part.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Each of us is at least one of many parts, and all the parts are gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CONSTITUTED A GIFT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must see how all the gifts are made or constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he was not a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was a persecutor, an enemy, of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After he was saved, however, he became a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But "became" is not an adequate word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is better to say that after he was saved, he was constituted a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was a rebel, a foe, an enemy, and a persecutor to the Body, but he was constituted an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be constituted means to be composed or transfigured with additional elements added in. Without the adding of these elements, nothing can be constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul was a rebel, but an element was added into this rebel which killed the rebellious germs.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Other elements were also added which built him up as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The point we must see is that the main element by which Paul was constituted an apostle is the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To prove this we must read Psalm 68:18 with an improved rendering: "Thou hast ascended on high, thou led a train of vanquished foes: thou hast received gifts in man; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ ascended on high, and having conquered all His enemies, He led captive a corporate train of vanquished foes, including Paul the Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then He received gifts in man and for man, even for the rebellious man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He received the gifts in His humanity for our rebellious humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So in this verse we see two kinds of humanities: the humanity of Jesus, by which He received the gifts, and our rebellious humanity, for which He received the gifts.</S>
