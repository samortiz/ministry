   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE TWO ORDERS OF THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For every high priest taken from among men is established on behalf of men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; Who is able to exercise forbearance toward the ignorant and straying, since he also is encompassed with weakness; And because of it he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And no one takes the honor to himself, but as he is called by God, even as Aaron also.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest, but He Who said to Him, You are My Son, this day I have begotten You; As also in another place He says, You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec...For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, To whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace; Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually Heb 5:1-6; 7:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AARON AND MELCHISEDEC</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These two parts of the Word reveal the two orders of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first order is according to Aaron, and the second is according to Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The order of priests according to Aaron was something of man bringing the needs of man to God, because these priests were chosen from among men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the order according to Melchisedec was one coming from God unto man, imparting something of God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are two directions, or a two-way traffic, in these two orders of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first order, the direction is from man to God, and in the second it is from God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even Christ as our great High Priest has these two orders with these two directions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is the High Priest according to the order of Aaron and also the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the order of Aaron, He, as a man, was chosen from among men to go to God with all the needs of man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But according to the order of Melchisedec, as the Son of God He came from God to impart God unto us and to bless us with something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now let us read Exodus 28:12 and 29.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial...And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Aaron, as the high priest, bore all the names of the people of God into God s presence as a kind of memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 14:18-20: And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And he gave him tithes of all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Melchisedec came from God with bread and wine to meet Abraham who had fought the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He blessed Abraham with the bread and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is quite interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He blessed Abraham with only these two things, the very same things which we use for the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1 Peter chapter two, we also find these two orders of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In verse 5 we see the order of Aaron, and in verse 9 the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the priesthood according to the Aaronic order, which brings something from man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The holy priesthood, in verse 5, brings something from man unto God, and the kingly priesthood, in verse 9, brings something from God to declare and show forth unto man.</S>
