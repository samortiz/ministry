   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THINGS BUILT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 31:7-11 we have a list of the things built.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 7 through 9 say, The tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the propitiatory cover which is upon it, and all the utensils of the tent; and the table and its utensils, and the pure lampstand and all its utensils, and the altar of incense; and the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its base.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have already covered the details concerning all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may want to consult the foregoing messages on these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here it is sufficient to point out that the ark of the testimony is Christ as God s testimony, that the table indicates that Christ is the life supply in the tabernacle to the serving priests, that the golden lampstand indicates that Christ is the light of life inside the dwelling place of God, and that the altar of incense indicates that Christ is the Intercessor to whom we should join to offer to God the incense of the salted prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, to experience the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils means that we experience Christ as all the offerings offered to God for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 10 says, And the finely woven garments, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to serve as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse indicates that the workers also made the garments for Aaron and for his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These garments typify the garments of Christ and of all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the building up of the church we need the garment of Christ and the garments of all the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This should cause us to realize, once again, how much there is the need for knowledge, understanding, and wisdom for the work of building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 11 concludes, And the anointing oil, and the incense of fragrant spices for the holy place; according to all that I have commanded you, they shall do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The anointing oil, which typifies the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, is a very important item.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since I have been in this country, I have given many messages concerning the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But due to the inaccurate teachings that have been promoted by certain ones, the truth concerning the anointing oil, the Spirit, has been a subject of debate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fight over this matter is still going on, and it will continue, I believe, for quite a time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the truth is the truth, and the Lord will gain the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For a time it is possible for the truth to be veiled but eventually, the veil will be removed, and the truth will be discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can testify that the more I speak on the all-inclusive Spirit, the more I am confirmed that what we teach concerning the Spirit is according to the divine revelation in the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we shall continue to place the truth concerning the all-inclusive Spirit before the Lord s people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let those who wish to criticize our teaching consider all things in the light of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Be assured that all our writings concerning the Spirit are done carefully and with consideration according to the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that in order to do the work of building up God s dwelling place, we need to be filled with the Spirit of God in knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and workmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also need to learn how to work in gold, silver, and bronze, in cutting stones for setting, and in the carving of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The building work includes those of both high estate and low estate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we need now is to become wisehearted, receiving wisdom and understanding from God, and to be stirred up by our heart to do the noble work of building up the church, God s dwelling place on earth today.</S>
