<h1 class="title">Pursuing Christ for Satisfaction</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: S.S. 1:2-4a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Attracted by Christ&rsquo;s love&mdash;1:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s love is more cheering than wine.</li>
	<li>Nothing is so cheering as Christ&rsquo;s love.</li>
	<li>His lover yearns for a direct kiss by Him with His mouth in His unrivaled love.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Charmed by Christ&rsquo;s name&mdash;1:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ in His resurrection became the compounded Spirit (Exo. 30:23-30), who is compounded with the olive oil, signifying the Spirit of the Triune God, and with:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Myrrh, signifying Christ&rsquo;s sweet death.</li>
		<li>Cinnamon, signifying the sweet effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death.</li>
		<li>Calamus, signifying Christ&rsquo;s life-dispensing resurrection.</li>
		<li>Cassia, signifying the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The name of such a consummated, all-inclusive, and life-giving Spirit sanctifies all the people and the things related to God&rsquo;s move.</li>
	<li>Such a name is fragrant and more charming than everything else.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Captivated by Christ&rsquo;s person&mdash;1:4a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He has drawn and captivated millions of His lovers to pursue after Him and is still doing the same today.</li>
	<li>Therefore, all His lovers would run after Him for their satisfaction.</li>
	</ol></li>
