   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Little Horn in Daniel 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Lesson Twelve, volume one, which covered the captivity and the prophets in captivity, the great image in Daniel 2 and the visions in chapters seven through twelve were mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Daniel 2 describes the great image in King Nebuchadnezzar s dream; chapter seven covers the vision of the four beasts emerging from the sea; chapter eight speaks of the clash between the ram and the he-goat; chapter eleven cites the things related to the southern and northern kings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What the little horn did in Daniel 8:9-14 and what the king from the north performed in 11:21-32a both refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The great image in chapter two is of four parts: the head, the breast and the arms, the belly and the thighs, and the legs including the ten toes .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fourth part is first divided into two legs and then into ten toes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The following are the ages signified by the first three parts as well as the two legs: the head refers to the Babylonian Empire 605-539 B.C. ; the breast and the arms represent the Median and Persian Empire 549-330 B.C. , which, although Media and Persia are likened to the two arms, was one kingdom; the belly and the thighs symbolize the Greek Empire established by the Macedonians 336-323 B.C. ; the two legs of the great image allude to the eastern and western Roman Empires 30 B.C.-474 A.D. . All of these, except that which is typified by the ten toes, have been fulfilled in history.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The four beasts in chapter seven are equivalent to the four sections of the great image in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first beast corresponds to the head of the image; the second, to its breast and arms; the third, to its belly and thighs; and the fourth, to its legs and ten toes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The ram and the he-goat in chapter eight parallel the second and third beasts in chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the he-goat equals the third beast as well as the third part of the great image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This he-goat has four horns, and out of one of them comes forth a little horn.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to history, the ram signifies Persia and the he-goat symbolizes Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>G. H. Pember, in his writings on the prophecies, says that signs of a ram could be found everywhere in Persia, especially in its capital.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ancient Greece also abounded with signs of a goat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible symbolizes Persia by a ram and Greece by a he-goat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this chapter, the he-goat refers to Alexander the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is recorded in history that when he marched into Macedonia, he wore a crown with a he-goat s horn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After a twelve year reign, he died suddenly before the age of thirty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Daniel 8:8 says that the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones towards the four winds of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The four generals under Alexander the Great carved up the empire, and each established his own kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Grecian Empire of Macedonia thus became four nations at the death of Alexander.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since these prophecies were written long before Alexander s time, in reading them one cannot but believe in the divine inspiration of the holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Daniel 8:9 continues, And out of one of them came forth a little horn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This little horn refers to Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, that is, the king of the north mentioned in Daniel 11:21-35.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Antiochus Epiphanes was the son of Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, and the younger brother of Seleucus Philopator.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was sent to Rome as a hostage when his father was defeated in the Battle of Magnesia.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His older brother, unwilling to see his continuous detainment, exchanged him for his own son Demetrius.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Upon his release, Epiphanes went on to Athens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When his brother was murdered by Heliodorus, Epiphanes, with the help of the king of Pergamum, killed Heliodorus and regained power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since Epiphanes fought on his nephew s behalf, the throne should have been inherited by Demetrius.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet instead of returning to Rome as a hostage and thereby relieving Demetrius to become king, he claimed the throne for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, Daniel 11:21 says that he was a vile person, obtaining the kingdom by flatteries.</S>
