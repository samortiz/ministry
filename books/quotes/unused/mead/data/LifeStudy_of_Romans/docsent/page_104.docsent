   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Receive Him Who Is Weak in Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 14:1 Paul says, Now him who is weak in faith receive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some believers are weak in faith because they have not yet received much of the transfusing and infusing of the element of God into them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, they do have a measure of faith and must be received.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some believers, being weak in faith, dare not to eat everything or to regard every day the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet they do have a measure of faith and are genuine believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So, based upon this measure of faith of theirs and the fact that they are believers, we must receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Not Passing Judgment on Reasonings</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to read all of 14:1-5.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now him who is weak in faith receive, not with a view to passing judgment on reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One believes that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who are you that judges another s household servant?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To his own lord he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One judges one day above another, another judges every day alike.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Romans 14 Paul himself was an excellent example of not passing judgment on doctrinal reasonings, for he did not express his opinion about which doctrine is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Certainly he knew the correct doctrines about eating and about the keeping of days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, he did not take sides, but charged all of us to be general and not to criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let others be free to eat whatever they want and to keep whatever day they want.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To them one day is holier than another, but to the ones who are stronger in faith every day is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also must learn not to pass judgments on doctrinal reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When people ask you about the method of baptism or the kind of water used, you should not get into a doctrinal argument.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In other words, do not make a judgment on the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The best way to reply to doctrinal questions is to help people to turn themselves from doctrinal concepts to Christ who is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By nature, we are all inclined to convince others and to argue with them about our concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must avoid that.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. Receive Him, for God Has Received Him</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 14:3 Paul says for God has received him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the basis on which we receive others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as our Father has received a person, we must also receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regardless how weak or how peculiar a believer may be, we must receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. All Are the Lord s and All Live to the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us read 14:6-9.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself; for whether we live, we live to the Lord, or if we die, we die to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord s. For Christ died and lived again for this, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All genuine believers are the Lord s. All have been born of the same Lord regardless of the way in which they have been baptized, of the food they eat, or the days they observe.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 6 through 9 show us what is important and what is not important.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To live for the Lord and to belong to the Lord are important.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as a person belongs to the Lord and lives to Him, he is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must not place further demands upon him in accordance with our doctrinal concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If, on the other hand, we begin to argue about doctrine, we shall soon be divided according to our various concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must care for the important things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as God the Father has received us all and as long as we believe in the Lord and live to Him, we should receive one another.</S>
