   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TWO THINGS CONCERNING THIS LIFE'S REACTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Finally, we need to pay attention to two things concerning this life's reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we have to pray every day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to ask the Lord to deliver us from temptations and from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to pray every day to be delivered from temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Humanly speaking, it is impossible to live on earth according to the principles spoken of above.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reactions required by the Lord are impossible to find on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You will exhaust all you have after trying to live this way a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why the Lord inserts a prayer in the teachings on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a prayer that prays for deliverance from temptations and from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can live in this world only with the Lord's protection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without His protection, we cannot go on even for a single day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This prayer is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we have no intention to live this kind of life or have this kind of reaction, nothing more needs to be said.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But as soon as we want to live by God's life, we have to pray this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We even have to pray this prayer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not share this principle of the Christian life with the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not share this principle of the Christian life with nominal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what Matthew 7 tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not give spiritual things to dogs, and do not throw pearls before swine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dogs and swine are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Dogs signify everything evil and unclean, and swine signify nominal Christians who are void of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Outwardly, they have split hooves, but inwardly they do not chew the cud.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Outwardly, they are Christians, but inwardly they are not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not tell them these words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you do, you are asking for trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you say this, they may say, "Turn your cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let me try this on you."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Telling them such things is to ask for trouble for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Pay attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should pray so that you can be spared such trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, we have to maintain our Christian standing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not seek trouble for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, with God's permission and under His sovereignty and the Holy Spirit's administration, we may face such situations, either at the hand of believers or unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At such times we should have the proper reactions and not retreat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Christian life is a wonderful life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more you are persecuted, embarrassed, and unreasonably treated, the happier you are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the only way to happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I hit a brother today, and he immediately turned his right cheek, I would be uncomfortable for a whole month; that would be the most unhappy thing for me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For as long as a Christian lives on earth, he cannot take advantage of anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you take advantage of something or someone once, you will not be able to lift up your head for a whole month before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Any gain on earth is loss in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is better to let others strike you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When others strike you, you can go home and sleep well, eat well, and sing well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You can climb up the hill, and the moon will shine brighter upon your face.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not think that you have gained something by taking advantage.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The only way to take the right course is to react the right way, and the only way to live according to proper principles is to have the right reactions.</S>
