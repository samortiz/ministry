   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE FREEDOM OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee attributed this chapter to an article by Rev Gordon Watt.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, Watchman Nee's article is quite different from the original article entitled "Liberty Through the Cross" by Rev Gordon Watt.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have therefore chosen to translate his chapter from the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Readers interested in the original article by Rev Watts should consult The Christian magazine, September 20, 1923, published by Morgan &amp; Scot, London, England, edited by James W. Thirtle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again" Gal 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Three words are used in the New Testament to describe the "freedom" for which Christ has set us free:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 A word for forgiveness, which refers to God's pardon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2 A word often translated authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This word refers to the privilege and authority purchased by the Lord Jesus through His precious blood for our freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3 A word that pictures one who was formerly in prison, but has now been liberated 1 Cor 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A bound life cannot deliver another bound life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many Christians are bound; they cannot follow the Lord freely, and they are subdued by their environment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They fear men and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan does not wish to see a Christian living the liberated life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet all the power of darkness has been defeated by the power of Golgotha.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The victory at Golgotha has secured for us our victory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's Word the Bible clearly points out the way that Satan exercises his great power to frustrate God's children from experiencing the freedom they deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE POWER OF SIN AND OF OUR OLD LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The power of sin and of our old living have been clearly dealt with on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should have faith concerning this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reckoning in Romans 6:11 describes the attitude of our will concerning a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a power in our flesh but the power in the Holy Spirit that reckons what God sees as true.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should adopt this attitude towards our old enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One power is continually used by Satan for his own end: suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In reading Romans 8:18, we see that suffering in God's will is often the pathway to light; through suffering one receives life and fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of God's children are pitiful and poor because they lack God-given trials.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But here is a question: do we view all sufferings and adverse conditions to be from the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians consider that they ought to submit to all adverse circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They do not realize that sufferings sometimes come from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These include things such as distractions, depressions, numbness, and things that hinder our spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As God's children, we should reject all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not accept anything that oppresses us and should not consider them to be God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should differentiate between God's will and Satan's will.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should know what is from love and what is from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should test all things by the spirit of the cross and by the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should identify what kind of suffering we are facing in various circumstances by the teaching of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should accept what is from God and reject what is from Satan.</S>
