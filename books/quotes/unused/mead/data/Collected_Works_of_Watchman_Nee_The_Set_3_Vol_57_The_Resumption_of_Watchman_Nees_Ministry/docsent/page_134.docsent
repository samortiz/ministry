   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Only by Being Dealt With</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and by Being in the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If I am one who has been disciplined by the Holy Spirit and one who has learned the lesson of fellowship, and if I am one who rejects not only the self but all individualism, and if I am one who has been dealt with in all these areas, then I will surely be one with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No matter how large a number we have, when this number is compared with the whole, it is worth nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The question is whether or not we are the same as all the other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are, we can say that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If not, even if we have sixteen hundred people, we cannot say that we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a man is in the Holy Spirit, he can be one with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a man is not in the Holy Spirit, there is no oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is no oneness of the church, even if the number is ten times sixteen hundred, there is still no church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Being Dealt With to Have the Body Consciousness,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>and Being Identified with the Body</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God wants our self to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Individualism must go, and we cannot act according to our own will; our outward shell must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Body is a matter of consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has to bring a man to the point where he realizes that he is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what we mean by the Body consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One has to be brought to the point where he feels that he is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When one member of your body moves, the whole body moves as well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is something very real.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said to Paul, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads'' Acts 26:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps Paul only remembered that he persecuted Stephen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not realize that while he was persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, he understood that in persecuting Stephen, he was persecuting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why Paul later said that when one member suffers, the whole Body suffers 1 Cor 12:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the whole Body is rejoicing, will not each member rejoice?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the whole Body is suffering, will not each member suffer also?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to stand on the ground of a receiving one, and we should receive the other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Pride goes before destruction Prov 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who sit on the high chair of a judge can surely not be runners of the race.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only those who receive, who are humble, and who step down from their throne can identify themselves with others and with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Otherwise, any oneness is but an outward performance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a man is one with the church, if others are in the flow, he will surely be in the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When others receive a certain guidance, he will receive the same guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the brothers and sisters will receive the same grace and take the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If everyone is hot, and you are the only one that is cold, it proves that you are not in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If everyone is going in one direction, you have to follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If everyone is burdened for Manchuria, spontaneously you will have the same burden.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If everyone is afraid of touching a certain matter, you will not dare to touch the same matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is something that issues from within.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not something that is arrived at by outward consensus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, every child of God is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we follow the footsteps of the flock in this way, God will lead us on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot withdraw ourselves simply because of our unwillingness to submit in certain matters, and we cannot fall behind or draw back.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Among God's children the most precious thing is this sense of identification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If all God's children see something one way and I feel another way, I should resolve not to fall behind the others, and I should be ready to identify myself with others.</S>
