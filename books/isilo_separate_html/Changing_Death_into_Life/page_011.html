<p>The picture in John 4 presents a Savior, a sinner, a well, and water. The Savior and the sinner met in front of the well and conversed with each other concerning water. The Savior sat by the well and waited in order to ask for water to drink. The sinner came to the well to draw water in order to quench her thirst. A thirsty Savior met a thirsty sinner by the well. Therefore, this picture shows the thirst of two parties in the universe: the Savior and the sinner.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Savior&rsquo;s Thirst</h2>
<p>The Savior was thirsty and asked the sinner for water to drink. According to John 1, this Savior is the God who created all things. He is the Lord of the universe, but He is also thirsty. He is thirsty because He lost man. Man is His delight and satisfaction. He created the universe in order to gain man. However, man sinned and became lost, and the Savior became thirsty. The Savior is thirsty to gain man. Only man can quench His thirst. He has no satisfaction apart from man. Thirst is a need within man that can be quenched by water. Within God there is also a need that can be quenched only by man. God needs man; man is the water that can quench God&rsquo;s thirst.</p>
<p>God became flesh and lived on the earth among men because He is thirsty to gain man. He &ldquo;had to pass through Samaria&rdquo; because He had to gain the immoral Samaritan woman. He disregarded His weariness from the journey and the hot afternoon sun and sat by the well, waiting for the Samaritan woman. He was a Jewish man, but He was bold to ask a Samaritan woman for water to drink because He wanted to gain her. He wanted to drink from her, not the water she drew from the well. Only a sinner such as she could quench the thirst of the Savior. This is what the Savior wanted.</p>
<p>The Savior was thirsty to gain sinners when He came to the earth. If there were no sinners on earth or if He could not gain sinners on earth, His thirst would not be quenched. Many people think that the Savior will not accept sinners like themselves. They do not know that they are exactly what the Savior needs; they are what the Savior wants. Without them the Savior is not satisfied, and His thirst is not quenched. They are the water that the Savior wants to drink. The Savior needs sinners like you and me. The Savior wants you to quench His thirst; He wants you to give Him water to drink. He is still thirsty today. He is thirsty to gain you.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sinner&rsquo;s Thirst</h2>
<p>In John 4 the Savior is thirsty, and the sinner is also thirsty. The thirsty Savior asked the sinner for water to drink, and the thirsty sinner came to draw water from the well. The universe is a place of thirst, in which there are a thirsty Savior and thirsty sinners. Who is not thirsty? Who is satisfied with his human life and feels no lack? Regardless of whether a person is rich or poor, noble or base, he is dissatisfied and discontent. The human life is a life of thirst, and human history is a record of thirst. Every human culture is a reflection of an attempt to satisfy thirst.</p>
<p>People in every part of society are thirsty. People thirst for knowledge, position, money, fame, a spouse, and children. There is no one who does not thirst, and there is no one who does not want to quench his thirst. Some people study, work, conduct business, or become government officials because they are thirsty and want to quench their thirst. Everything that man does, including his striving and struggling, is governed and driven by his thirst. The thirst within man pushes him to be busy night and day and to run everywhere, both physically and mentally. Man is busy because he wants to quench his thirst.</p>
<p>Man is busy doing many things because of his thirst, and he also sins because of his thirst. Man seeks amusement and entertainment to quench his thirst. Amusement and entertainment have led countless people astray into sin and have trapped countless people in the deep pit of sin. People are trapped in sin because they want amusement and entertainment to quench their thirst. Moreover, many people do not hesitate to sin in an attempt to quench their thirst. Many sins are derived from man&rsquo;s thirst and from man&rsquo;s desire to quench his thirst. A man who is satisfied, not thirsty, does not commit sin. Every sinner is thirsty, not satisfied. People lead a dissolute life by indulging in eating, drinking, fornication, adultery, gambling, and smoking because they are thirsty and dissatisfied. They want to quench their thirst and be satisfied.</p>
<p>Some people go to movie theaters because they are thirsty. Some people go to dance halls because they are thirsty. Some people are involved in fornication because they are thirsty. Some people gamble because they are thirsty. Even though all these activities are poisonous, people drink this poison in order to quench their thirst. They are driven by their thirst and disregard the terrible consequences because they hope that such activities can quench their thirst and satisfy their empty feeling.</p>
<p>Man is thirsty because he does not contain God. Just as God needs man, man also needs God. Man is God&rsquo;s satisfaction, and God is man&rsquo;s satisfaction. Without man God is thirsty, and without God man is thirsty. Man&rsquo;s existence is for God because God created man for Himself. If man does not gain God and does not exist for God, man cannot find his proper place or fulfill his function. People feel that their human life is empty, because they have not gained God; their life is not for God.</p>
<p>Without man God has a great lack, and without God man has a great void. In order for God to be satisfied, He must gain man, and in order for man to be satisfied, he must gain God. Man is for God, and God is for man. In order for God to be satisfied and to quench His thirst, He must gain and enjoy man, and in order for man to be satisfied and to quench his thirst, he must gain and enjoy God.</p>
<p>The Samaritan woman is an example of thirst. She represents every thirsty person. The Samaritan woman brought her waterpot under the hot sun at noon to draw water. How could she not have been tired or thirsty? It was the custom during that time for women to go in groups to draw water at dusk, or at sunset, when it was cool. Drawing water was a tiring task, but going as a group and chatting together made it pleasant. This woman, however, had an immoral living and was held in contempt. She dared not go with others to draw water, because she was ashamed of her filthy living. In order to avoid being mocked, she went alone to draw water at noontime, when the sun was hot and everyone was resting at home. Under such circumstances, how could she not feel lonely? How could she not be thirsty?</p>
<p>This woman had had five husbands, and the man she was currently with was not her husband. This proves that she was dissatisfied and discontent with her human life. She had her first husband because she was neither satisfied nor content. She was not satisfied or content with her first husband, so she had a second one. She was not satisfied or content with the second husband, so she had a third one. She was still not satisfied or content after the third husband, so she had a fourth, fifth, and sixth husband. Such a dissatisfied life speaks of the empty sense in her spirit and shows her great thirst.</p>
<p>The Samaritan woman was thirsty in every respect. She was thirsty physically, she was thirsty psychologically, and she was thirsty spiritually. Her whole being was thirsty, and she had been thirsty her whole life. She was a thirsty person. No wonder the Spirit chose her as a representative of the immoral.</p>
<p>The Samaritan woman was thirsty because she did not have God. Her life was not satisfying, because she had not gained God. She had gained many husbands, but she had not gained God. She had her waterpot, the well, and water, but she did not have God. She was thirsty for God, not for other things. Her thirst was not because she lacked other things but because she lacked God.</p>
<p>Therefore, John 4 presents a thirsty Savior and a thirsty sinner. The Savior was thirsty, and the sinner was thirsty. The thirsty Savior came to the well in order to get water to drink, and the thirsty sinner came to the well in order to get water to drink. The Savior was thirsty because He needed a sinner. The sinner was thirsty because she needed the Savior. The Savior wants to drink, to gain, sinners, and sinners should drink, gain, the Savior.</p>
<p>The Samaritan woman was thirsty, but she did not know the reason for her thirst. She sensed a need, but she did not know what she needed. She did not know that she needed God, nor did she know the gift of God and Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
