<p>Hymn #631 in Hymns says:<p class=hbody>If I’d know Christ’s risen power,<br>I must ever love the Cross;<br>Life from death alone arises;<br>There’s no gain except by loss.</p><p class=hbody2>If no death, no life,<br>If no death, no life;<br>Life from death alone arises;<br>If no death, no life.</p><p class=hbody>If I’d have Christ formed within me,<br>I must breathe my final breath,<br>Live within the Cross’s shadow,<br>Put my soul-life e’er to death.</p><p class=hbody>If God thru th’ Eternal Spirit<br>Nail me ever with the Lord;<br>Only then as death is working<br>Will His life thru me be poured.</p><p>We are persons under the shadow of the cross of Christ. The Christian life is both a living life and a dying life. We live, but we live in the mold of the death of Christ. When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, He was being crucified every day. Every day He lived a crucified life. We also can live such a life because we have the power of His resurrection. As we have seen, this power is the person of Christ, and Christ today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ who is in our spirit. As we remain in our spirit, we experience this power in the shadow of the death of Christ. Every day our spouse and children are the “shadows of death” to us. Our children may be very enjoyable to us at first. However, one day they may become shadows, and the more they grow, the darker the shadows may become. Eventually, our children will put us into the mold of the cross. We should simply remain there and say, “Hallelujah!”<p>Not only are our marriage life and family life the mold of the cross, but even the church life becomes the mold of the cross to us. Certain saints may wonder why there are hardships in the “glorious church life,” and eventually the church life may not seem so glorious to them. Every brother and sister may seem to be a “dark shadow.” This may cause some to consider moving to a new locality. However, they may discover that the church in the locality to which they move is even darker. Furthermore, if they leave the church, their situation will become darker still. We have no place to which we may escape. Every locality is a cross. This is our destiny. We have been destined to pass through the cross. Only when we are in the New Jerusalem in the new heavens and new earth will we be out of the shadow of death. In the New Jerusalem there will be no night and no shadow (Rev. 21:25). However, today there are shadows of the cross everywhere.<p>Praise the Lord that within us there is the power of resurrection. Paul said, “I can do all things in Him who empowers me” (Phil. 4:13). The One who empowers us is the power of resurrection. By Him we can live a life that expresses and magnifies Christ (Phil. 1:20).
