   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The first fulfillment of the new covenant is being cleansed of our sins by God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The forgiveness of our sins by God is something that belongs to the covenant; it is not apart from the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we have seen that God covenanted with us to forgive and not remember our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you still not know that you are saved?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Are you still afraid that you will perish?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You can say to God, "God, you have made a covenant with me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Have you forgotten about my forgiveness?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please execute this matter, according to Your covenant."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you pray this way, you can immediately rise up and forget about everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since you have done your part, God will surely be faithful to do His part.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The forgiveness of sin does not come through earnest begging, but through a righteous procedure that is based on our right under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The forgiveness of sins is our legitimate right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God cannot forgive or not forgive according to His likes or dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has made a covenant with us, and He has to act according to His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has purposely given us this handle so that we can lay hold of it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hebrews 10:1-2 says, "For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the image itself of the things, can never by the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, perfect those who draw near.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since our conscience has been purified, we no longer have the consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is what the sacrifices offered year after year could never do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only the blood of the Lord Jesus can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God sees the blood, He will forget our sins and cause our conscience to have no more consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before we were saved, we were often conscious of our sins and had no way to stop our conscience from condemning us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After we believed, we saw that the Lord's blood was shed for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He suffered the punishment of sin to the point of death, and He received, on our behalf, the punishment that we deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From this point on, no sin can make our conscience remember or suffer anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since the conscience is cleansed, we have no consciousness of sins anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not worship God in this way, we do not have a way to worship Him, because we truly do not have the assurance that we are saved and have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before God, we will just drift.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must first be able to stand before we can run.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the same way, without standing firmly on the ground of salvation, we can never advance and never run the spiritual race before us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consequently, when we break the bread, we cannot praise, rejoice, and worship God like others, for deep in our hearts, we do not have the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord for His blood, because it can cleanse us of all our sins before Him so that our conscience will have no more consciousness of them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now, before God, we can enjoy His grace and unlimited love because we know that there is no more problem, and we are no longer conscious that we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do you know what faithfulness is and what righteousness is?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Faithfulness is related to God's word, while righteousness is related to God's acts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is faithful to every word that He speaks and righteous in every act of His.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why does God forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His words are faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since He has said that He will forgive us, He will surely forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, His acts are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since He has sent His Son to take away our sins and bear our punishment, He has to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to His faithful promise, He has to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to His righteous act, He has to reckon the death of His Son as our death and the judgment and punishment of His Son as our judgment and punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is righteous and cannot claim His debt twice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He cannot be that wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He cannot claim the debt from the Lord, and then come to us to claim the same debt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He cannot do this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If He does, He will be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we can ask for His forgiveness and cleansing according to the covenant that He made with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, when we confess our sins and ask for God's forgiveness, can He answer or refuse according to His pleasure?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No, He cannot do this because forgiveness is an item within the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we confess our sins, according to the covenant God has to forgive us and cleanse us from our sins and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we confess, according to the covenant, God will surely not remember our sins and surely be propitious to our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Friends, do you know how to speak to God based on the covenant?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Would you dare to hold onto God's covenant and say to Him, "Your covenant says that if we confess our sins, You will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now I come and confess my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Please forgive my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Bible does not say that our sins will be forgiven only when we have prayed to the point that we have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It does not say that if we do not have peace after we pray, our sins have not been forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is not such a thing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to realize that when God made a covenant with us, His intention was for us to speak to Him according to the word of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He wants us to ask Him in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we ask God to accomplish the word of the covenant for us, we are not begging for mercy but are claiming our rightful portion according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank God that within the covenant, there is the word of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can mourn and lament over our own sins.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can do our best to hate sin and make up our mind never to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We can acknowledge that sin is a great suffering and say that we dare not come to God when we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But none of these things can make us godly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we think that by earnestly hating sin, we will be more easily forgiven, we are not trusting in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We may think that by mourning and lamenting over sin, we will be more easily forgiven, but there is not such a thing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The writer of the book The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life, Mrs. Smith, once asked a saved girl what she would do if she were to sin again, and what would Jesus do if she were to sin again? The girl answered that if she sinned, Jesus would make her suffer for a while and then would forgive her.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not think that this is a child's word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is what adults do all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many adults have the same thought.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They think that after they sin, they have to suffer for a while before they can be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Friends, forgiveness is by the blood and not by our mourning and lamenting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Forgiveness does not come after waiting a long time until we do not feel sorry anymore and have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Forgiveness is something within God's covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God promised, through the Lord Jesus' shedding of the blood, that He will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today, when we receive and believe in the Lord, God will forgive and be propitious to our sins according to the covenant and will not remember our sins anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Who among us today still has no peace in his heart?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Who is still afraid that his sins have not yet been forgiven?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You have to know that God is not so high that He is unapproachable.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Nor is He free to do whatever He wants according to His will and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He is bound by His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All you have to do is ask Him according to the covenant and speak to Him according to the promises in His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Do you know what surrounds God's throne?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As long as the rainbow remains around the throne, God will answer a prayer that we pray according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Revelation 4:3 says that the throne is surrounded by a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>On earth we only see one end of the rainbow, but in heaven the rainbow encircles the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What does the rainbow signify?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The rainbow is a sign of the covenant that God made with Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He told Noah that the rainbow would appear in the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When He sees the rainbow, He remembers the eternal covenant that He made with all the living creatures on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The sign of the covenant encircles the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The covenant is surrounding God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Therefore, He has to answer our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>How wonderful it is that God has given to us such a handle and surety to lay hold of.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Who among us still has his sins unresolved?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>You can bring your sins to God, take hold of His Word, and believe in Him according to His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We can rest in His covenant and deal with God by taking hold of His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If we do this, we will see God working according to His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>In "that day" we will see how God's grace and love flows forever to eternity in heaven and how it flows to us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The reason we have lost many spiritual blessings and rest is that we do not realize that God has made a covenant with us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When we speak to Him according to the covenant, He will act according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The reason we have not received, even after knowing this, is that we do not have the faith and have not acted according to the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If, after we know it, we act on it, we will surely receive the spiritual blessings and rest that God has promised us.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The sooner we do this, the sooner we will receive.</S>
