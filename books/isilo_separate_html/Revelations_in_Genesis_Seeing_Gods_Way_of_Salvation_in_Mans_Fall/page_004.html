<h1 class="title">THE FIRST FALL OF MAN</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the process and the result of man&rsquo;s first fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF MAN&rsquo;S FIRST FALL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Not Being Exercised</h2>
<p>The first step in the process of man&rsquo;s first fall was failing to exercise the spirit. Eve assumed the headship and went beyond God because she did not exercise her spirit. God created man with a spirit to contact Him (Gen. 2:7; Prov. 20:27; Job 32:8). After man was created, he should have used his spirit to contact God and live before God. Man is preserved by God when he lives according to his spirit, but in the garden man did not exercise his spirit to contact God. Instead, he went beyond God and fell into the hand of the evil one. If man had remembered God&rsquo;s right and authority over him and exercised his spirit to ask God about Satan&rsquo;s words, he would not have gone beyond God and would not have fallen. Therefore, the first step in man&rsquo;s fall involved setting God aside by not exercising the spirit. Going beyond God to contact something outside of God is the first step of man&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:16-17 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.&rdquo; By saying this, God was making known that man should only pay attention to God, contact God, receive God, and gain God. Man should not pay attention to, contact, receive, or gain anything other than God. Whenever man pays attention to things other than God, he gets into trouble and falls into the hand of the evil one, Satan. Man fell because he neglected this matter, went beyond God, and paid attention to something other than God.</p>
<p>The tree of life signifies God, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies everything other than God. God&rsquo;s forbidding man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a serious warning and reminder that man should contact only God; otherwise, his end is death. Man violated this principle in the first step of his fall by going beyond God and paying attention to something other than God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Soul Being Exercised</h2>
<p>The second step in the process of man&rsquo;s first fall was the soul being exercised. When Eve spoke and reasoned with the serpent, she exercised her mind first (3:2-3). This was the second step in her being deceived. Verse 6 then says, &ldquo;When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make oneself wise, she took of its fruit and ate.&rdquo; All these are matters related to the soul. <em>To be desired</em> indicates that her emotion was exercised. <em>To make oneself wise</em> indicates that her mind was exercised, because wisdom belongs to the mind. <em>Took of its fruit and ate</em> indicates that her will, her determination, was exercised. The functions of the mind, emotion, and will in man&rsquo;s soul were all exercised. Thus, the second step in the process of man&rsquo;s fall is the soul being exercised.</p>
<p>The first step of man&rsquo;s fall involved not exercising the spirit. The second step involved exercising the soul. Not exercising the spirit is to go beyond God, and exercising the soul is to assume the headship, because our person is in the soul. In our entire being, the soul represents our person, our personality. When one&rsquo;s soul is exercised, one&rsquo;s person is exercised.</p>
<p>If Eve wanted to contact God, she could not have done so by just exercising her mind, emotion, or will, because the mind, emotion, and will are not faculties for contacting God. Man cannot contact God by exercising his soul; man must exercise his spirit to contact God. If Eve had exercised her spirit instead of her soul, she would not have gone beyond God or assumed the headship. If Eve had said, &ldquo;I will go ask God,&rdquo; when the serpent tempted her, she would have exercised her spirit, not her soul. If she had exercised her spirit, she would not have gone beyond God or assumed the headship. However, because she set God aside, went beyond God, and ignored God, she exercised her soul in her decision to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>Man is taking the way of the fall when he uses his soul first, rather than his spirit, in anything. Many people exercise only their soul in their daily living; hence, their way before God is the way of failure. For instance, in the matter of marriage, some young saints do not use their spirit to pray, to have fellowship with God, or to ask God what to do concerning their marriage. They use their soul rather than their spirit. Furthermore, they mainly exercise their emotion, their loving faculty, and then their mind to consider. Only then do they decide. All these are matters related to the soul. A young saint rarely uses his spirit first in order to contact God when proceeding forward in the matter of marriage. If he uses his spirit to contact God first, he will not go beyond God or assume the headship in the matter of his marriage. If he first exercises the faculties of his soul and follows his soul to take the way of the soul&mdash;exercising his emotion to see marriage as desirable, then exercising his mind to consider it as being good, and then determining to proceed according to the resolution of his will&mdash;he will assume the headship and go beyond God. In such a situation, he will fail and fall.</p>
<p>Christians on the proper way should first exercise their spirit in every matter. Once we use our spirit, our soul stops. Once we use our spirit, we contact God and put God first. Rather than assuming the headship, we are safeguarded. This should be the principle not only in our marriage but in every matter, great or small, in our Christian life. Regrettably, many Christians do not live according to this principle; most live according to the fallen principle of exercising only their soul. They begin with their preferences, consider and plan according to their thoughts, and then decide according to their will. All three steps are matters related to the soul. Every time that Satan tempts us, and we exercise our soul instead of our spirit to contact God, Satan succeeds, and we are taking the way of the fall.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
