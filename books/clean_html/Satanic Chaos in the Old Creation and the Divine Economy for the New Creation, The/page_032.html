<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Satanic Chaos Ending<br>with the Termination of the Evil Satan,<br>the Old Creation, and All the Negative Things<br>in the Lake of Fire</H2><P>The satanic chaos will end with the termination of the evil Satan, the old creation, and all the negative things in the lake of fire (Rev. 20:9&#151;21:1, 8; 22:15). The lake of fire will be the universal "trash can," and all the negative things, which have caused the chaos in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament, will be gathered there. The lake of fire, therefore, will be the ending of all the chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Divine Economy Being Consummated<br>with the Processed Triune God,<br>the New Creation, and<br>the Holy City of Living Water</H2><P>The divine economy will be consummated, not ended, with the processed Triune God, the new creation, and the holy city of living water (Rev. 21&#151;22). The holy city of living water is the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is a composition, a constitution, of the redeeming Triune God with His redeemed tripartite man. He will be our temple where we will worship and where we will have our dwelling, and we will be His tabernacle where He will dwell and where He will enjoy us as His satisfaction. Hence, the New Jerusalem will be a place of mutual dwelling and mutual satisfaction for eternity. I hope that we will all be comforted by this revelation concerning the end of the satanic chaos and the consummation of the divine economy.</P><P>We have emphasized the fact that the satanic chaos is in the old creation and that the divine economy is for the new creation. The divine economy is to produce the new creation out of the chaotic old creation. This producing of the new creation will continue until the end of the millennium (Rev. 20). That will be the time for the new heaven and the new earth to appear with the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem, the holy city, will be the consummation of the divine economy.</P><P>The New Jerusalem will be the enlargement and consummation of today's church life. We praise the Lord that we are in the church. In the church life we experience the divine economy with the help of the satanic chaos. The satanic chaos helps our Christian life and also our church life.</P><P>In the Old Testament, which ends with the expectation of Christ's coming, Christ is prophesied and promised. He was the expectation of God's chosen people. In the New Testament Christ has come, and He is coming. Christ's first coming, or the first part of Christ's coming, initiated the New Testament economy. His second coming, or the second part of His coming, will consummate the New Testament economy. Between the initiation and the consummation, there is the long period of the church life. The church life is also a part of Christ's coming. Christ has come, yet His coming is still taking place in the church life. The process of the church life is the process of Christ's coming.</P><P>Today we are experiencing the church life, which is the process of Christ's coming. Every time a sinner is baptized, that is a further step of Christ's coming. Likewise, our growth in life is the advancement, the furthering, of His coming. The more we advance, the sooner Christ will come. If we want to hasten Christ's coming, we need to advance more quickly.</P><P>As we are in the church life as the process of Christ's coming, we should not be troubled by any kind of chaos. We should not be bothered or disappointed by chaos, because chaos actually helps us. Every kind of chaos is a help to God's chosen people and to Christ's Body, the organism of the Triune God.</P>
