   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING TO FIGHT THE BATTLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN A DESPERATE WAY WITH NO OPINION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some saints came to me a number of times with reports concerning serious and even negative situations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They may have misunderstood my not responding to them with any kind of seriousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe I did not respond in this way not only out of my patience and toleration but also because of the Lord s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I feel that it is altogether wise to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the fruit of a particular tree is growing, the fruit itself will show what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the fruit becomes ripe, it will fall from the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At this point, however, I do not feel that I should tolerate certain situations any longer because enough damage has been done already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not like to see more damage done to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have no time, dear saints, to fool around with people any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let us go to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who are the us ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ones who are desperate with no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the eighteen years that I was involved in the work on mainland China, I did a lot but no one ever heard any opinion from me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They only heard my voice in giving messages all according to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some brothers can testify that among all the co-workers with Brother Nee in those eighteen years I did the most.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But I labored without voicing any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the co-workers conferences sometimes Brother Nee would ask, Witness, what would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>My attitude was that whatever Brother Nee told me to do, I would do it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From 1932 to 1950 no one ever heard me expressing any opinion regarding the work in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, there is nearly nothing different between my understanding and Brother Nee s except for one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I never told anyone what this was, not even my wife or family, until I came to this country and Brother Nee went to be with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The doctrinal item which I felt different from Brother Nee was regarding the two witnesses in the book of Revelation 11:3-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the only difference between my understanding and Brother Nee s. My intention is to show you that I was not altogether the same in everything with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this one thing I was not the same and I am still not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My point is this in spite of this difference, I never uttered anything in my ministry that Brother Nee did not preach, and I did not teach anything that he had not touched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>ONE FLOW</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord has opened my eyes to realize as I have told you in the past, that in the Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is only one current flowing from the throne Rev 22:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At Pentecost the current began to flow out of Jerusalem through Judea, through Samaria, and went up to Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There the flow turned to Asia Minor, to eastern Europe, to Rome, and probably even to Spain, which by that time was considered as the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was only one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You cannot see two flows in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Barnabas was an excellent brother who actually brought Saul of Tarsus into his ministry Acts 11:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the beginning Barnabas took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the way of their first journey, however, the Spirit records that Paul began to take the lead, and the Spirit began to refer to Saul as Paul Acts 13:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The change of name may indicate the change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From this point on Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way, and Barnabas accepted that.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Barnabas was one with Paul to go to Jerusalem to get the solution regarding the trouble of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Right after that solution was made as a decree to all the churches, there was a contention between Barnabas and Saul Acts 15:35-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This contention was not about something great but about something small.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They did not separate from each other because of a different opinion concerning the faith or concerning the headship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The split between them was concerning a small, personal, intimate thing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Barnabas wanted to take his cousin Mark along with him on their journey and Paul said no. To us that is a small thing, but after Barnabas left Paul with Mark there is no more record of him in the Lord s move in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The reason for this is because the Lord would only care for one flow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I saw this matter clearly in 1933 when Brother Nee asked me to join him in the work in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At that time I was doing a work in north China that was quite prevailing and even promising to me in teaching the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because my eyes were opened, I told the Lord that I would go to Shanghai to join Brother Nee and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I realized that the Lord s flow, the Lord s current, on this earth has been only one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If north China were to be taken by the Lord, He would surely do it through the same flow.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I had to jump into this current, to be one with this current to let the Lord flow.</S>
