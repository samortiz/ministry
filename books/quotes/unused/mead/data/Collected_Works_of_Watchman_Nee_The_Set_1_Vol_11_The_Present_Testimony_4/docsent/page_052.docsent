   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I know that many of you have argued with God this way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I also know that many of you are still in the midst of arguments and have not settled them yet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You continue to complain about the way God has dealt with you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers, let me tell you that the outcome of such arguments will determine how you live from this point forward.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In other words, the richness or dryness of our life depends on the way you handle such arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you win, God will fail, and there will be no other result but dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Never rejoice at your victory or your freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Never think that you have won forever just because you have gained what you desired.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is really a pronouncement that your life is drying up and that your living is falling fast.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the experience of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All spiritual dryness comes when you begin to argue with God, when He has failed and you have won.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your life will never flourish when God fails.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, this will never happen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers and sisters, if you are in the middle of a dispute with God and the matter is not yet settled, if there is an unresolved problem between you and God, and if you are still not clear concerning the will of God, I can frankly say that this is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You have to be very careful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you blame God or despise His arrangement, you will fail right then.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to wait until the whole thing is exposed; your dryness will begin right then.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, God will not allow us to hear a message or offer a consecration and let the matter be concluded.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every time you say that you will not fail, that you will be an obedient Christian, and that you will follow the Lord to walk in the way, the Lord will test you immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord will not allow you to bear the name of being obedient to Him, without first testing you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He can only use those vessels that have passed the test.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether or not you are faithful is not determined at the time you hear a message, nor is it determined by your confession or acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since God cannot trust in you, He allows affliction and persecution pertaining to His word to come upon you and test you to see how you will react.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then you will prove if you really are for God or if you were merely making a superficial confession.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the time of your trial, you may not praise Him as much as before.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During those times, you may not be as clear about God as before.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But He still has to test you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Friends, when I first began to work for the Lord, I went one day to visit an elderly sister, Miss Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We sat in the living room together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She began to ask me, "Is your intention in giving yourself to serve God something that God wants?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What does the Lord want you to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I answered, "He wants me to serve Him."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She then asked, "What if the Lord does not want you to work for Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I answered, "He surely wants me to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I know that."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She then began to read with me the passage in Matthew 15 concerning the Lord feeding the four thousand with the seven loaves and the fish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She asked me what this passage meant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I answered that the disciples put the loaves and the fish in the Lord's hand, and when the Lord had blessed them, they became manifold and the four thousand were fed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She then added one word, which I can never forget to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, at that time I was quite bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She said that all the loaves in the Lord's hand were first broken before they were distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Any loaf that was not broken could not be changed and could not sustain another's life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She also said, "Brother actually she was older than my parents , please remember that many times we are like the loaves, who would say: Lord, I will consecrate myself to you.'</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But even though we have consecrated ourselves, we secretly hope in our heart that the Lord will not break us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We hope that the loaf can always be whole, beautiful, and always remain unchanged.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But no loaf that is in His hand is ever unbroken.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do not want to be broken, it is better that you do not put yourself in His hand."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It has been twelve years since the day she talked to me about this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During these twelve years, I have deeply learned this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I realize deeply that this word is true.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every loaf that is in the Lord's hand is broken by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, allow me to say the same thing to you now: "If you do not want to be broken by the Lord, please do not put yourself into His hand."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is where the problem lies with many people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When they hear the teachings concerning overcoming, they are very happy and say, "God, I will consecrate everything I have to you."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when God begins to break them, they cry, "Oh, I did not expect to encounter such things."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brothers and sisters, this kind of living is painful and difficult to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, God has laid hold of us, and we cannot be like other ordinary men anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, we do not want to be broken that way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, if you have not counted the cost and are not ready to be broken by Him, you will find yourselves dissatisfied with God, and God will be dissatisfied with you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you do not want to follow the Lord, God can do nothing with you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if you realize that it is right to obey the Lord and do not want your life to dry up, wanting instead to have a strong and vigorous life, you will have to allow God to test the reality of the word you received with affliction and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not know how many people have experienced dryness as a result of failing the test of this word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In another two days, we will consider God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is questionable whether or not we can come up to that standard.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times we hope and desire, but we have not passed through the dealings in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, we cannot be as we wish.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the cross is our test.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The cross will separate us, and we will see on which side we are.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I will not go into this at this time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I will speak on the reason that the seed becomes dry.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why do seeds grow so fast, yet dry up so soon?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why do they dry up immediately after the sun comes out?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord gives us three reasons in Mark 4.</S>
