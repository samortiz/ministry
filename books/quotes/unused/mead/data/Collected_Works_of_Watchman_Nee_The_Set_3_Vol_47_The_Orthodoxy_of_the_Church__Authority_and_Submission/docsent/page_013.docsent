   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Revelation 2:9 the Lord speaks a very strong word: "Those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.''</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word "synagogue'' is especially related to Judaism, just as "shrine'' is related to Buddhism, "monastery'' to Taoism, and "mosque'' to Mohammedanism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A certain brother said that we should not call our meeting place a church assembly hall, but a Christian synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If so, when a Jew passed by, he would greatly misunderstand; for synagogue is a term used exclusively in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can we say that there is such a thing as a Christian synagogue and yet not bring in Judaism?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord says that they are the synagogue of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Jews spoken of here refer to the Jews in the church, because they even bring in a "synagogue.''</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>May God be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must utterly get rid of all the things of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church in Smyrna there was tribulation, poverty, and the slander of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But what does the Lord say to them?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried'' v. 10 . Fear not! Many times if we could only know that something is caused by Satan, the problem would be half settled.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is when we start thinking that it is caused by men that we have difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we could only know that it is done by the enemy, the problem would be solved and our heart could immediately rest before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"You will have tribulation for ten days'' v. 10 . Here we have the problem of "ten days.'' Many expositors of Revelation and Daniel are accustomed to counting one day as a year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since they count these ten days as ten years, they look for these ten years in history but find nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I personally feel that there is absolutely no scriptural basis for this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many places in the Bible where days cannot be reckoned as years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, Revelation 12:14 says, "A time and times and half a time,'' referring to three and a half years, and verse 6 speaks of "a thousand two hundred and sixty days.''</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A Jewish calendar year is 360 days; therefore, 1,260 days are three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one day is equivalent to one year, then this would become 1,260 years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the great tribulation were to last for such a long time, what would people do?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What then is the actual meaning of ten days?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the Bible ten days are spoken of many times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Genesis 24:55 there are "ten days.''</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the servant wanted to take Rebecca with him, Rebecca's brother and mother requested that she stay with them for at least ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Daniel and his friends would not allow themselves to be defiled by the king's food, they asked the officer in charge to try them for ten days Dan 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So "ten days'' in the Bible has a meaning, that is, a very short time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The words which the Lord speaks here have the same meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On one hand, this means that there are certain days for our suffering, and that our days of suffering are counted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After these days, we shall be released just as Job was.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, it means that the ten days are a very short time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter what trials we pass through before God, they will not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the days are fulfilled, the devil can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The trials which we suffer will pass quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life'' Rev 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faithful unto death is a matter both of time and of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord insists that the life of all those who serve Him belongs to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why we must be faithful even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whoever is bought with the precious blood belongs to the Lord and must be wholly for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From the very outset Christ demands our all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now He says, "Be faithful unto death.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As to our attitude, we must be faithful even unto death; as to time, we must be faithful until death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"I will give you the crown of life.''</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The crown is a reward; at that time, life will become a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death'' v. 11 . Here it clearly says that not only will we escape the second death, but we will not suffer the hurt of this death, for we have already learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Tribulations are severe; if we have not been in tribulations, we never know how terrible they are.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Poverty is oppressive; if we have never been poor, we do not know the taste of it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Slander is also oppressive; if we have never been slandered, we do not know its painfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is as if every encounter drags us into death, but as we pass through, we prove that resurrection is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord came out of the grave, and we too will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His resurrection life today cannot be drowned, so we dare to say that we too cannot be drowned.</S>
