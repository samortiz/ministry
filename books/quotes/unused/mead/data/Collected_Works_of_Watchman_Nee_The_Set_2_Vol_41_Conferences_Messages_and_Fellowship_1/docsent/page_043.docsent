   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN TEMPTATIONS, FAILURES, AND PROGRESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE OVERCOMING LIFE Date: November 18, 1935, 9 a.m.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Chuenchow</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: John 1:16</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are two things a believer should do before he can overcome: let go and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are also two things he should do after overcoming: confess and consecrate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Victory is a gate as well as a path.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first two enable one to pass through the gate, whereas the last two sustain one in the path.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How should a believer conduct himself day by day after he has passed the gate of victory?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can the overcoming life be guarded, and how can he go on in the overcoming way?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to consider these questions one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE LIFE ONE SHOULD LIVE AFTER PASSING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE GATE OF VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After we pass the gate of victory, our daily life should be no different than the first day we overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every morning we should commit ourselves to the Lord and allow Him to guard, protect, and uphold us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the same time, we should fill ourselves with thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to say to the Lord, "God, in Your eyes I am still weak and I still cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I have not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I thank You Lord because You are still my life today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are still my holiness today, and You are still my victory today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe that You will live out Your life in me the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God, I thank and praise You because everything is based on Your grace; Your Son has accomplished everything for me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No matter what our feelings may be, we have to believe that the Lord is living in us, and we have to stand on this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should be very clear that the Lord is within us and that it is no longer we who are living, but the Lord who is living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After we have passed the gate of victory, we have to maintain a proper posture.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every day we have to tell the Lord that there is no goodness in ourselves, that we are still as evil as we were before, and that we are full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By ourselves, we are not able to do anything; only the Lord is able.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we think we can do something, the Lord will not do anything for us, and we will immediately fall.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will overcome only when we do not overcome by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One line of a hymn says, "Whene'er my heart is lifted up, How very near I am to fall" Hymns, #578 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is indeed true.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers, we have to realize that we are still the same; we have not changed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our only stand before the Lord should be to declare that we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Simply put, after passing through the gateway of victory, our daily life involves 1 committing ourselves into the Lord's hand, 2 acknowledging that we cannot make it, 3 believing that the Lord is living in us, and 4 thanking and praising Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE WAY TO OVERCOME THE TEMPTATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>An overcoming life is a life that overcomes temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we have received the overcoming life, it is still possible for us to encounter temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord also encountered temptations, but He overcame them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Similarly, we cannot avoid temptations, but we can overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We encounter two types of temptations daily.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first kind are temptations that come suddenly; they do not give us a chance to think about them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before we can think about or pray about them, we have already sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These temptations are not restricted to any time; they come haphazardly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The second kind are temptations that come slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can consider them, and they come as incremental suggestions and proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One kind does not afford a person time to think, whereas the other kind gives a person time to think them over.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may think that temptations which give us a chance to think them over are easy to overcome, and that temptations which do not afford an opportunity to think over are difficult to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually, we can overcome both kinds of temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are two ways to deal with these two kinds of temptations.</S>
