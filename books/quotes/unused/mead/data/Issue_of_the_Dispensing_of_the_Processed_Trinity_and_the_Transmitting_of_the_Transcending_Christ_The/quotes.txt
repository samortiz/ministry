[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California on November 25-28, 1993.
[3]  Prayer: Lord, we treasure Your blessing; we treasure Your presence; and we treasure Your Spirit, Your blood, and Your word.
[4]  How we thank You for the divine provision, which is so rich, so prevailing, so refreshing, and so touching.
[5]  How could we, the created human beings, become the sons of God?
[6]  We do not become His sons by adoption but by His begetting.
[7]  Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ."
[8]  We may wonder what sanctification has to do with our daily life.
[9]  The Bible says that we should not provoke our children to anger Eph 6:4 .
[10]  When we are angry with our children, we often provoke them.
[11]  In dealing with our children, we have to take care of our spirit.
[12]  1.Without dispensing His holy element into our being, how could God make us holy?
[13]  Especially for God's sonship, there is the need for God to dispense His life and nature into our being.
[14]  2.The Father's dispensing in His choosing and predestinating of the believers issues in His sonship through His sanctifying of His chosen people, making them holy as He is in His life and in His nature, to make them like God in the divine life and nature, but without His unique Godhead.
[15]  In Ephesians 1 the most striking thing is the dispensing plus the transmitting.
[16]  The dispensing is done by the processed Trinity, and the transmitting is done by the transcending Christ.
[17]  What the Trinity dispenses is for producing the many sons of God, the heritage to God as His treasure, His private possession, and a glorified body as the consummation of the Trinity's dispensing.
[18]  The formation of the church does not depend upon the Trinity's dispensing but upon the transcending Christ's transmission with His surpassing, transcending power which raised Him up from the dead, seated Him at the throne of God, subjected all things under His feet, and made Him the Head over all things to the church vv.
[19]  The first step of the divine sanctification by the Spirit is His seeking sanctification.
[20]  After regeneration, the next step of the Spirit's sanctification is His transforming sanctification.
[21]  Now that we have seen the issue of the Father's dispensing, we want to go on to see the issue of the Son's dispensing, which speaks forth the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose.
[22]  These verses say, "In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace, which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him; in whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will, that we would be to the praise of His glory who have first hoped in Christ."
[23]  They think that the three of the Godhead are separate and that we cannot say the Son became the Spirit.
[24]  Before we were saved, we were in an upside-down situation.
[25]  But the Spirit in His seeking sanctification brought us back to God.
[26]  THE SON'S DISPENSING TO MAKE THE BELIEVERS GOD'S INHERITANCE UNTO THE ECONOMY
[27]  God chose us with a purpose to make us different from everything in this universe, that is, to sanctify us and to make us holy for the purpose that we could be begotten of God to be His sons.
[28]  THE APPLICATION OF GOD'S ACCOMPLISHED PURPOSE Scripture Reading: Eph 1:13-14
[29]  The Bible shows us that there are two stages in the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[30]  Many Christians say that Christ's ministry was finished at the end of His death.
[31]  If Christ's ministry were only on the earth in the flesh, He could not dispense anything into us.
[32]  In the earthly ministry of Christ there is only the accomplishing; there is no dispensing.
[33]  Whatever Christ accomplished was objective to us, not subjective, until He became a life-giving Spirit.
[34]  In His resurrection He began to impart, that is, to dispense, His divine life into us.
[35]  The dispensing of the Spirit is carried out in His sealing the believers Eph 1:13 .
[36]  1.The Spirit's dispensing in His sealing and pledging issues in the redemption of our body, the transfiguration of our vile body into a glorious body like that of Christ.
[37]  2.The Spirit's sealing of the believers as God's heritage is the Spirit's anointing, saturating, and soaking of the believers with the divine element of Christ's riches of life in the believers.
[38]  OF THE TRANSCENDING CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:15-23
[39]  When I came to this country in the sixties, I observed the hippies with their long hair, beards, and wild clothing.
[40]  A number of young people who came into the recovery in the sixties were like this.
[41]  We should not think that the universe is so simple.
[42]  We are speaking of things which are not visible to the eyes of worldly people, but they are visible to us.
[43]  This is why Paul, before sharing this portion of the Word, prayed, asking the Father to give His people a spirit of wisdom and revelation that they may have the full knowledge of Him Eph 1:17 .
[44]  I hope we can see that the church was formed and came into being by His transmission.
[45]  This is the transmission of the transcending One's great power that raised Him from among the dead in Hades and that caused Him to transcend to the Father's throne above all the human race and the angelic race.
[46]  This is the great power that subdued and subjected all things under His feet and that gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[47]  This great power is toward us who believe Eph 1:19 and to the church v. 22 . This indicates that the divine power is transmitted into us to cause the church to come into existence.
[48]  After the church comes into existence, daily, hourly, and moment by moment, by His mercy and grace, we must learn the lesson to be supplied with His gradual, slow, and fine dispensing in a threefold way by the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[49]  THE THREEFOLD DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY TO PRODUCE THE MATERIALS AND THE UNIQUE TRANSMISSION OF THE TRANSCENDING CHRIST TO FORM THESE MATERIALS INTO THE CHURCH
[50]  1.The triune dispensing of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in the Father's choosing and predestinating, in the Son's redemption and transformation, and in the Spirit's sealing and pledging issues in bringing forth God's many sons, in producing a heritage of worth to God, and in the transfiguration, glorification, of the regenerated and transformed saints, which is the participation in God's sonship to the fullest.
[51]  OUTLINE Since the transmitting of the transcending Christ includes all the triune dispensing, it is the total continuation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity Eph 1:19-22a: The three aspects of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity produce the components of the church, the Body of Christ.
[52]  The transmitting of the transcending Christ is to transfuse into the church, the Body of Christ, what the Triune God has accomplished, attained, and obtained in Christ: This is not only for producing the church but also for growing, establishing, and building up the church.
[53]  It is also, even more, the organic constitution issued out from the element and essence of the Triune God into the regenerated believers in Christ that they may be an organism to express the processed Triune God as the Body of Christ: Such a church is universal, but it is to be expressed locally.
[54]  For this message I would like us to read Ephesians 1:15-23: "Therefore I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and your love to all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him, the eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."
[55]  I have spoken on the church many times throughout the past sixty years.
[56]  When I first began to speak on the church, the standard was too low, but thank God that my speaking on the church has been all the time going up.
[57]  My burden is not to merely teach us the Bible but to present us a view so that we can really see what the church is.
[58]  The view of the church over these many centuries has been made very dim.
[59]  Those who do not see anything at all say that the church is a physical building.
[60]  Concerning Christ and the church, there were three great things: incarnation, resurrection, and Pentecost.
[61]  In incarnation the very God became a man, and this man in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit.
[62]  God became a man, this man became the life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit brought in the formation of the church, the constitution of the Body of Christ.
[63]  Now we have a Savior, we have an all-inclusive, consummated Spirit who is the reality of Christ, and this Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God.
[64]  If you have received the gift of a spirit of wisdom and of revelation, you will see that the church is just one.
[65]  In the eyes of God, all the local churches are just one.
[66]  CHAPTER SIX THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23 OUTLINE It is the intrinsic significance of the church.
[67]  It is the divine constitution of the Triune God with the believers in Christ Eph 4:4-6.
[68]  I believe that in the past five chapters we have seen God's economy.
[69]  We have also seen that the way to carry out the Triune God's economy is by His threefold dispensing plus Christ's onefold transmitting.
[70]  Ephesians 5:18 tells us not to be drunk with wine, that is, not to be filled in our physical body with wine.
[71]  Our spirit needs to be filled with the processed Triune God, with the transcending Christ, with the consummated Spirit.
[72]  But some may argue by saying, "Brother Lee, didn't you say that the administration of the churches should be local and independent?"
[73]  I may have said that many years ago, but if you asked me to repeat such a saying today, I would not do it.
[74]  Because we are on this earth, we are limited by time and space, and we have many business affairs.
[75]  The saints in Anaheim and the saints in San Francisco and Fresno cannot meet together often.
[76]  At least I can testify for myself and for my senior brother, Brother Watchman Nee.
[77]  We always behaved, acted, and took action in the recovery as one Body.
[78]  THE ORGANIC AND UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST EXPRESSED IN MANY LOCAL CHURCHES
[79]  The organic Body is undivided and it is also indivisible 1 Cor 1:13a .
[80]  This unique Body of Christ is expressed in many local churches Rev 1:11 in the divine oneness as it is with the Triune God John 17:11, 21, 23 and in the divine nature, element, essence, expression, function, and testimony.
[81]  I thank the Lord for the rich blessing, even the particular blessing, that He has bestowed upon this conference.
[82]  Through the ministry and fellowship in this conference, Ephesians 1 has become much more clear to me in three points: first, in the triune dispensing of the Divine Trinity; second, in the unique transmitting of the transcending Christ; and third, in the spirit of wisdom and revelation, through which we can realize and participate in the triune dispensing and the unique transmitting.
[83]  I do look to the Lord that He would show us that His triune dispensing is to produce continuously the materials, components, and constituents of the Body of Christ.
[84]  All the constituents needed for the constituting of His organic Body were produced in the threefold dispensing of the Divine Trinity.
[85]  In Christ's unique transmitting, He put all these constituents together to form a Body.
[86]  This Body is not merely a church as a gathering of called-out believers, but an organic constitution, the organism of the Triune God.
[87]  This organism is also the unique house of the Triune God 1 Tim 3:15 , and this house is both the household and the dwelling place of God Eph 2:19-22 .
