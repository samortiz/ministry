   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IT WILL NOT LET YOU GO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This book seems to be very simple and easy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you consider it from the historical point of view, it tells the origin of the universe, the earth, the plants, human beings, how they established their kingdoms, and how they will eventually end. This is all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is nothing special about it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet it has been handed from generation to generation for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today it is still with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, if you do not confess that it is truth, you have to conclude that it is false.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You can disregard many books, but you cannot ignore this book.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nor will it ignore you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It will not let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It demands a verdict from you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It will not pass you by.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another remarkable thing about this book is that almost half of it is prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among the prophecies, almost half of them are fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The other half are for the future and await fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, it predicted the fate of the nations of Moab and Ammon and of the cities of Tyre and Sidon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today when people talk about big cities, they mention London and Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then it was Tyre and Sidon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were two chief cities of the ancient world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The prophecies concerning these two cities were all fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once I was in the Middle East.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For some reason I did not visit those two places.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, I bought two pictures of those cities.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It amazed me when I looked at those pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I could not help but believe in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was prophesied that if these two metropolitan cities did not repent, they would be destroyed and devastated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Their land would become hills of rocks and pebbles where fishermen would come to dry their nets.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the pictures that I bought, there was nothing but fishing boats and open nets on the shore.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is only one small fact that proves the reliability of biblical prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you compare past events with the prophecies in the Bible, you will find that they all correspond one with another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For another example, take the birth of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Isaiah prophesied concerning a virgin with child a few hundred years before Christ actually came.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, He was born indeed of the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The prophecy was accurately fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the prophecies concerning the past have been fulfilled, so the prophecies concerning the future must also be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE BOOK FOUND</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God desires to communicate with man, He must do so through common human channels of communication.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He must use the human language or human writings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, there must be a book in the world that is a direct revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If such a book does exist, it must contain the four criteria we mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we can say that such a book is found.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This book tells us that God desires to have fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He speaks to us through this book.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through it God is no longer an unknown Being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can now know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This book is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope all of you will read it.</S>
