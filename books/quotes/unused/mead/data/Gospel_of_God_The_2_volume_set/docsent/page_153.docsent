   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE WAY OF SALVATION FAITH GOD'S SALVATION BEING FOR EVERYONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Over the past few evenings, we have looked at the things that man considers to be ways of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we do not twist the Word of God but trust in it, we will see from it that none of those things are a condition for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have mentioned already, according to the Bible there is only one condition for salvation faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Together the words faith and believe occur in the Bible over five hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among these many verses, over a hundred verses tell us that salvation is by believing, that justification is by believing, and that we receive life by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In over thirty places we are told that through faith we receive this or that from God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These places show us that man is favored by God through faith and nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why does the Bible put so much emphasis on faith?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Tonight we will consider why faith has to be the way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we must first ask a question.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is salvation a work of man or a work of God?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is it man's plan or is it God's plan?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Does it originate with man or with God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who do not know God do not know salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only those who know God know God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Those who know God have to admit that it is God who has initiated salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is God who has planned it, and it is God who has accomplished this plan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we have mentioned before, everything is done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On our side, we do not have to do anything except believe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why do we have to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is because redemption is accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God wants to make the method of salvation so simple that everyone can obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That is why He requires only faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If salvation is from God, it must be universal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God's salvation were just for a certain group of people, God would be partial.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If God's way of salvation required something from us, that something would become an obstacle to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there were the simple requirement that man had to wait five minutes before he could be saved, even that would greatly diminish the number of saved ones in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many people do not have even five minutes to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God would not have to require even perfect righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If He were to require righteousness in only one thing, perhaps you could render Him this righteousness, but hundreds of thousands of people on earth might not be able to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If such were the case, salvation would not be so simple.</S>
