In this message I would like to give a further word concerning the answer to this question, an answer which is found not in the Old Testament but only in the New Testament. This answer, given by God in His revelation, is altogether concerned with the Triune God Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S INTENTION<br>BEING TO WORK HIMSELF<br>INTO MAN</H2><P>The New Testament unveils to us that God's intention in His creation of the universe and of billions of items including man is to work Himself into man. God wants to enter into man to be man's content and to be man's life, nature, life supply, and element. In order to do this, God had to pass through a long process.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD COMING OUT OF ETERNITY<br>AND ENTERING INTO TIME<br>TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN BEING<br>NAMED JESUS</H2><P>The Bible is not written according to human logic but according to God's move. Although God did many things in the Old Testament, He did not move. Rather, from Adam to Christ, God remained in His divinity and stayed in eternity. He did not yet come out of eternity into time to enter with His divinity into man. But one day, after a period of four thousand years in which man had been tried, tested, and proved to be sinful and good for nothing, God came out of eternity and entered with His divinity into time, entering into the womb of a human virgin to join Himself to humanity. This was the first step of God's move. The second step was His being born of that human virgin to be the God-man. After staying in the womb of a human virgin for nine months, He came out of that womb, not only with divinity but also with humanity, to be a human being by the name of Jesus. This human being is extraordinary, altogether uncommon, because He is the God-man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST'S LIVING<br>A GENUINE HUMAN LIFE<br>TO EXPRESS GOD IN HIS HUMANITY</H2><P>This dear One, this God-man who is both divine and human, Jesus Christ the Son of God, lived a genuine human life on earth. He ate and drank, He slept, He rejoiced, and He wept. According to the four Gospels, in this person we can see human virtues that expressed the divine attributes. This means that in His living the Lord Jesus achieved the greatest thing in the universe&#151;He expressed God in His humanity.</P>
