<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. PETER'S IMPRESSION WITH THE LORD'S COMMISSION TO FEED HIS LAMBS AND SHEPHERD HIS SHEEP</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Telling the Believers to Return to Christ<br>as the Shepherd and Overseer of Their Souls</H2><P>Peter was so impressed with this commission of the Lord that in his first book he told the believers that they were like sheep being led astray, but they had now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer (Christ) of their souls (1 Pet. 2:25). Christ's shepherding of His flock includes His caring for their outward things and also their inner being, their souls. He takes care of the things concerning their souls by overseeing their souls. Christ indwells us to be our life and everything, but He is also overseeing, observing, the condition and situation of our inner being. He shepherds us by caring for the welfare of our inner being and by exercising His oversight over the condition of our soul, our real person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Exhorting the Elders<br>to Shepherd the Flock of God</H2><P>Peter exhorted the elders to shepherd the flock of God among them so that when the Chief Shepherd is manifested, they, the faithful elders, will receive the unfading crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:1-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Heavenly Ministry of Christ<br>Being Mainly to Shepherd the Church of God</H2><P>Peter's word indicates that the heavenly ministry of Christ is mainly to shepherd the church of God as His flock which issues in His Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE MAIN PURPOSE AND GOAL<br>OF THE APOSTOLIC MINISTRY INCORPORATED<br>WITH CHRIST'S HEAVENLY MINISTRY</H2><P>The main purpose and goal of the apostolic ministry incorporated with Christ's heavenly ministry are to build up the Body of Christ which will consummate the New Jerusalem for the accomplishment of the eternal economy of God.</P>
