   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE SIXTY-FIVE A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 14 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:14-18; 4:26; 9:1-8; 10:23-25; Rom 14:17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the foregoing message we considered the background of the Lord s ministry in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We saw that in His baptism He terminated the things of religion and culture.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in His ministry He sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This seed develops into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, the kingdom of God is for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose; on the other hand, the kingdom of God is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us now go on to see how God s chosen people are the soil into which Christ as the seed of the kingdom is sown to develop into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>SOIL TO GROW CHRIST INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s chosen people are the soil to grow Christ into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, God s people have become fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the picture portrayed by the cases recorded in Mark, they were sick, contaminated, paralyzed, withered, corrupt, deaf, dumb, blind, and even spiritually dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s people had been destined by Him to be the soil in which Christ would be sown as a seed and in which He would grow for the development of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But this soil became sick, contaminated, paralyzed, and withered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The soil was corrupt, blind, deaf, dumb, and even demon-possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before we were saved, we all were this kind of soil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter one of the Gospel of Mark the Lord Jesus began to gather the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1:14 and 15 we are told that Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Repent and believe in the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately after this we have the record of the Lord s calling four of His disciples: Simon, Andrew, James, and John 1:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that the Lord preached the gospel by sowing Himself as the seed into people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1:16-20 we see four of those whom the Lord gathered to be the soil into which He sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>FOLLOWING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Lord gathered the disciples in 1:16-20, what did He want them to do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 16 tells us that Simon and Andrew were casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jesus said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you become fishers of men v. 17 . Immediately, they left their nets and followed Him v. 18 . Going on a little further, the Lord Jesus saw James and John in a boat mending the nets.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He called them, and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went after Him v. 20 . Here we see that these four disciples left their nets, their boat, their father, and even the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They left everything to follow Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I read the Gospels as a youth, I wondered what it meant to follow Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was very impressed with the Lord s words, Follow Me. Later I was taught that to follow Jesus meant to do whatever Jesus did.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, Jesus loved people, and we also should love others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus was gentle and kind, and we also should be gentle and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At first I agreed with this understanding of the meaning of following the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But eventually I discovered that to follow Jesus in this way can be compared to teaching a monkey to act like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A monkey may be trained to sit, stand, and walk like a man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this is nothing more than mere imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, many Christians try to follow Christ in the way of imitating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This understanding of following Jesus is mistaken, and we should repudiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we are still left with the question concerning what it means to follow the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have emphasized the fact that when the Lord Jesus called the disciples, He gathered them to be the soil into which He would sow Himself as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we may say that to follow Jesus is to be put in His pocket for the purpose of His sowing Himself into us.</S>
