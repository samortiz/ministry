   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE EXPERIENCE OF SOULISH BELIEVERS THE LIVING OF THE SOULISH BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The living of the soulish believers cannot be the same for everyone, due to individual differences.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Each man in the world has his own personality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When one believes in the Lord and is regenerated unto eternity , his personality is not annihilated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Otherwise, eternity future would not be interesting at all!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the soulish living of the believers differs with individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, we can speak only in general terms, mentioning those matters which are more prominent in the soulish living and describing briefly the experiences of different aspects in order that the children of God may compare their own experiences with these.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Soulish believers have a characteristic of being curious.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They study biblical prophecies to know the things of the future that they may have the ideal information to satisfy their curious mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their apparel, speech, and conduct indicate that they have an attitude of being different and superior.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They seek to achieve startling, instant success with many of their activities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even before they believe in the Lord, they already have such an inclination, and afterwards it is still hard for them to overcome their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are not like spiritual believers who do not seek to understand any matter inquisitively.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Soulish believers do not seek to reconcile their experiences with God's teaching, but pay attention mostly to the understanding in their mind; that is, they like to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What saddens them the most is not that their experience fails to catch up with their ideals, but rather that they cannot understand with their ideals and their mind the spiritual experience they lack.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Having the error of some kind of self-deception, they think that whatever they understand mentally is what they have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, this is a great error.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Soulish believers often have an attitude of self-righteousness, though sometimes it cannot be detected easily from the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are very stubborn with their trivial opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should hold fast to the major truths recorded in the Bible, but we certainly can let others have the liberty concerning minor points.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we think our understanding is very clear and that what we believe is without any mistake, to strain out a gnat and swallow a camel displeases the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should lay aside differences on small points and pursue the oneness on major points.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The mind of soulish believers is often disturbed by evil spirits so that their thoughts become confused, mixed up, and sometimes defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In their conversation they answer what is not questioned, and their mind travels at high speed, changing topics every so often and proving how scattered their thoughts are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even when they pray and read the Bible, their body is present, but their mind is far away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In their deeds, either dealing with men or matters, they do not think they act without forethought.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet when others speak to them about their conduct and how one should conduct himself, they can select similar incidents from their deeds to illustrate how carefully they consider and act according to principle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Occasionally, they indeed think before they act.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The conduct of the soulish believers is often very fickle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Soulish believers are touched easily.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes they are very excited and happy, while other times they are very depressed and sad.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When they are happy, it seems the world is too small to hold them, and they want to fly away to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when they are sad, it seems they are superfluous in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes they are extremely happy and stirred in their emotion, as if a fire were burning or a treasure had been found.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes when their heart is not burning, they suddenly have a feeling of loss and become dejected and unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their joy and their dejection depend on their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They do not have a living which is steady and unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their joy and their grief govern their living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most soulish believers are over-sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are very difficult to deal with because they think everything around them is directed at them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If they are slightly neglected, they become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They readily suspect that others' attitude toward them has changed; thus they become sorrowful, sad, and resentful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They can easily become intimate with others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They live in human affection to the extent that it becomes difficult for them to separate from others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is a slight change in such a relationship, it causes an unspeakable pain in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nevertheless, they think this is to suffer for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God knows the weakness of the soulish believers they often are self-centered, thinking that they are very special when they have some spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, He often gives them special grace to enable them to have many extraordinary experiences, such as the feeling of joy and the feeling that the Lord is very near, very real, and touchable, in order that they may humble themselves and draw near to God who has given them the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, these believers do not act according to God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They do not give glory to God and draw near to Him simply because He has given them grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, they utilize the grace of God as the basis of their own boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They think that they have received such grace simply because they are stronger than others and that since they have such experiences they are therefore more spiritual than others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Soulish believers mostly have sensuous joy and special experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these cause them to think that they are more spiritual than others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Little do they know that actually these are the evidences of their being soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The spiritual ones are those who live by faith and not by feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sometimes it is not the feeling that causes the soulish believers to change.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Oftentimes their heart is divided by external affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>People, things, and affairs in the world often invade their inner man, causing them to lose the peace in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you place a soulish believer in a joyful environment, he will be joyful, but if you place him in a difficult situation, he will be sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He lacks the power to create his own environment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He becomes red when he is close to vermilion, and he becomes black when he is close to ink.</S>
