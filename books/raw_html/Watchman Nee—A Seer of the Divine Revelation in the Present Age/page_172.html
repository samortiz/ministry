<P>In response to their handing themselves over to the work for the Lord's recovery, Brother Nee and I wrote the following reply to them:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>March 18, 1950</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>"While it remained, was it not your own? And when it was sold, was it not under your authority?" Acts 5:4</P><P>Dear Brother Jin-chin:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>We have read the paper you have handed to us. After fellowshipping over the matter twice, we feel that according to your present spiritual condition, the time has not yet come for you to work together as "stewards." Hence, concerning your future, we feel that you should proceed according to the following methods:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>1) As much as possible, everything in your possession that you have no use of should be sold. Try to gather up everything together. Half of these proceeds should be given to the elders of the church for the building of the meeting hall in Hong Kong. The other half should be sent away through the elders for use of the work in Shanghai.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>2) Your business is returned to you for your own management. The profit you gain should be handed over to the elders for the use of the work in the Hong Kong region.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>We hope that you can be faithful in this matter and that you can give a good account before the Lord as a faithful steward on that day. Moreover, we hope that you will advance more in your stewardship in financial matters.</P><P>Peace be to you.</P><P>Your brothers,</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>Witness Lee</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
