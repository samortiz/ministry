<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE WAY TO WALK, LIVE, AND HAVE OUR BEING IN AND ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 5:16-20; Rom. 10:12; Eph. 6:17-18; 2 Tim. 2:22</h1><p>In this chapter I want to share the real burden on my heart for my concern about the Lord’s recovery. The Lord has shown us His economy, and He has shown us the contents of His economy, especially throughout the past thirty-two years. Most of the messages from this ministry have been put on audio and video tapes and have also been printed in books, yet according to our observation, generally speaking, we do not practice what we have seen of the Lord. Therefore, in this chapter I will come from the high peak of God’s revelation down to the place where our feet are, where we are. I hope that I can do my best to show you what our need is today. The fellowship in this chapter and the following chapter is also my burden, the real word on my heart, for the elders in the Lord’s recovery.<h2 class=head1>THE PRACTICES NEEDED TO CARRY OUT GOD’S ECONOMY ACCORDING TO THE HIGH PEAK OF GOD’S REVELATION</h2><p>Let us read 1 Thessalonians 5:16-20: “Always rejoice, unceasingly pray, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit; do not despise prophecies.” In this portion of the Word, I ask you to pay attention to three points. First, pray unceasingly. Second, do not quench the Spirit. Third, do not despise prophecies.<p>Romans 10:12 says, “For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him.” Here it says that the Lord is rich. His riches are unsearchable (Eph. 3:8), but how can we participate in and enjoy the Lord’s riches? Here is a very simple way. This way is to call upon Him.<p>Ephesians 6:17-18 says, “And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.” We teach the practice of pray-reading the Word based upon what Paul said here. Ephesians 6:17 says that the Spirit is the word of God. The Lord Jesus said, “The words which I have spoken to you are spirit” (John 6:63). The word in Ephesians 6:17 is not the word in black and white. This word equals the Spirit. The next verse, verse 18, tells us that we have to pray this word, and we have to be watchful concerning this kind of prayer. In other words, we have to be watchful concerning our pray-reading. This is not just to be watchful concerning our reading of the Bible or our prayer in a common way. This is a particular prayer of praying the word, making the word our prayer. In this sense, we do not need to compose a prayer, because our prayer is the living word of God.<p>Second Timothy 2:22 says, “But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.” This verse charges us to pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace. These items are the Lord Jesus Himself, so to pursue these things means to pursue Christ. Paul here itemized the practical points concerning Christ. Christ is our righteousness. Christ is our faith. Christ is our love. Christ is our peace. Our practice of living the life of a God-man is a constitution of Christ as righteousness, faith, love, and peace. Paul charged Timothy to pursue Christ as these items by calling on the name of the Lord. This calling is not just by yourself but with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<p>You may think that we cannot see anything high in all these verses and that these things are common among us. My fellowship, which is my burden, is this. Yes, all these things have been gradually unveiled to us by the Lord in the past years, and they have even been printed in books. But in our practice, there is a big shortage. How much have you called on the Lord today? Do you pray-read the word consistently and adequately? Do you pray unceasingly? Do you fan the Spirit into flame (2 Tim. 1:6)? We are told not to quench the Spirit, but nearly all of us quench the Spirit every day.<p>Now in our church practice, we promote the matter of prophesying. But even thus far, not many churches are practicing this prophesying. Most of the saints who do practice prophesying do not realize what it means to prophesy in the church meetings. Some give a word of their kind of experience or feeling, or they tell a story in the meeting. That is not prophesying. To prophesy is to speak God’s word to people. In this speaking, Christ is spoken forth by you. To prophesy is to speak Christ forth into people. This mainly means to minister Christ. We minister Christ to others by our speaking. You may excuse yourself by saying that you do not have the gift to speak as some brothers have. But can you say that you do not have the gift to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into people? We all have this gift, a gift to speak Christ (1 Cor. 14:31).<p>To carry out God’s economy according to the high peak of God’s revelation, we need all these practices. We were charged to walk, to live, and to have our being in and according to the mingled spirit (Rom. 8:4). How can we do this? We can do this only by these few steps: calling on the name of the Lord, pray-reading His word as the Spirit, praying unceasingly, not quenching the Spirit, and not despising or ignoring prophesying. If you cut yourself off from these things, you are finished; you can never live the life of a God-man. A God-man’s life is a life of calling on the Lord, pray-reading His word as the Spirit, praying unceasingly, not quenching but fanning the Spirit into flame, and not despising but respecting prophesying. If you miss any part of these few things, you miss a lot.
