<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE STARS&#151;CHRIST AND THE SAINTS</H2><P>The stars are Christ and the saints. Although Christ is the real sun, He does not appear as the sun during this age of night. He shines as a star, as the bright and morning star (Rev. 22:16b). Christ Himself is a star. All the overcoming saints are also stars. Second Peter 1:19 tells us to take heed to the sure Word until the morning star, which is Christ, arises within us. Revelation 1:20 not only tells us that the churches are the lampstands shining with the Spirit, but also that the angels, the leading ones or the messengers in the churches, are the shining stars. Daniel 12:3 says that those who turn many from the wrong way unto righteousness will shine as stars. Matthew 5:14 says that the believers today are the light of the world and Philippians 2:15 says, "among whom you shine as lights in the world." All these verses show that the saints who are in the proper way and have the proper standing are stars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. TO RULE FOR DISCERNMENT</H2><P>These fourth-day lights rule for discernment. Discernment comes from light. Without the fourth-day lights, it is difficult to discern anything. We all need this discernment for the growth in life. Young people need discernment regarding where to go and where not to go, what to say and what not to say, what to do and what not to do, what is of God and what is of Satan, what is in the spirit and what is in the soul. Even the junior high young people need discernment concerning their schoolmates, which classmates to contact and which ones they should never touch.</P><P>Discernment comes from light. When the light shines, the light rules. If I am in a room without light, I will stumble. Without light there is no direction, no ruling, and no discernment. However, if I am under the shining of the light, I can discern which way I should go.</P><P>You junior high students are different from all other students in school because you are children of the day. The others are still in darkness. When you speak with your teacher, you know what you should say. You have discernment. The best way for parents to take care of their children is to cast them into the hand of the Lord. Then, they will have the light, and the light will be their ruling. This ruling of the light will give the children the best discernment. They would never be tempted into drugs. Discernment is the biggest protection.</P><P>Again I say, this discernment comes from the shining, and the shining of the light is just the ruling. If you read and pray over Genesis 1:14, 16, 18 and Ephesians 5:8-11, 13-14 until these verses get into you and the light shines upon you, you will know what you must reprove and what you must accept, what you should receive and what you should reject. Also, 1 John 1:5-7 is a good portion telling us that God is light, that if we have fellowship with Him we are in the light, and that when we walk in the light we know the difference between darkness and light. We have the ruling with the discernment.</P>
