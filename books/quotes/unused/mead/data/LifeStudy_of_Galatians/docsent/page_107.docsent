   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our God today truly is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Old Testament there is no indication that God has been processed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This process began at the time of Christ s incarnation and continued throughout His human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some Christians object to the expression processed God, with the argument that God is eternal and never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yes, we definitely believe according to the Bible that God is eternal and that He is not subject to change.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, we believe and teach, also according to the Bible, that God has passed through a process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has not changed, but He has passed through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God does not change in His nature or substance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But He has passed through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to John 1:1 and 14, the Word which was in the beginning with God and which was God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The use of the word became in John 1:14 indicates a process.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, 1 Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is another indication of God s process.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may object to our use of the word process because this term is not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the same objection could be made with respect to the word Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word Trinity cannot be found in the Bible either, but the Bible nevertheless reveals the fact that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the same principle, although the Bible does not have the term processed, it does reveal the fact that God has passed through a process.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God Himself became a man by incarnation and lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then He was crucified, descended to Hades, and came out from among the dead and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, He ascended to heaven with a glorified body of flesh and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even now, the Lord is on the throne with such a body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before Christ s incarnation, did the Lord on the throne in heaven have a body of flesh and bones?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But for eternity He will be enthroned with such a body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Does this fact not indicate that God in Christ has passed through a process?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hallelujah, our God today is the processed Triune God!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is the ultimate expression of this processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>RECEIVING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the book of Galatians Paul asks the believers in Galatia if they received the Spirit by works of law or by the hearing of faith 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From Paul s tone we can learn that receiving the Spirit is a very significant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Receiving the Spirit is not a matter of having an experience of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To receive the Spirit is to be born of the Spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Balaam s donkey miraculously spoke a human language, but that donkey was not born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This illustration indicates that to be born of the Spirit is far greater than to speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It may be that we never speak in tongues, but we can declare to the whole universe that because we have been born of the Spirit, we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, we are not mere adopted sons or sons-in-law; we are sons in life born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We who have been born of God are divine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have experienced a divine birth, and we have the divine life and partake of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely this is the greatest miracle in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Often when I consider this matter of the divine birth, I am filled with wonder and beside myself with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How marvelous that we are sons of God and that the Triune God is in us as the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In his Epistles Paul charges us not to walk by a particular doctrine or instruction, but to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Recently the Lord has shown that He does not want us simply to live in His presence, but to live Christ by being one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many years ago I was helped by the well-known book by Brother Lawrence, The Practice of the Presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I was young, I loved that book very much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, I have come to see that the practice of the presence of God is actually an Old Testament matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the New Testament there is not a word about practicing God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead, in the New Testament it is revealed that we should live Christ by being one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Genesis 17 we read that Abraham walked before God, that is, in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul says, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is more than simply walking in God s presence; it is to walk in oneness with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul s word about being one spirit with the Lord is not an illustration; it is a statement of fact.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, Paul did not say, To me to walk is to be in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Rather, he said, To me to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is a tremendous difference between walking in the presence of God and living Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>During the last few years the Lord has shown me how much my practice has been the Old Testament way of walking before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I can testify that over the years I have been quite successful in walking before the Lord and living in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But now I am practicing to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Again and again I confess my shortage to Him concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Usually in the morning I pray, Lord, I thank You for another new day to live You, another day for me to practice being one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Lord, grant me this day s portion of grace that I may live one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although I may pray such a good prayer early in the morning, during the day I may fail again and again to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes I have asked myself how much time during the day I have spent truly one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have seen how much I live according to ethics instead of according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But to be ethical is one thing, and to be one spirit with the Lord is another.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To walk by the Spirit simply means to be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first kind of walk by the Spirit, that mentioned by Paul in Galatians 5:16, is the walk in which we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From my experience I have learned that it is much easier to live in the presence of the Lord than to live one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Often in speaking with others I am in the Lord s presence; however, I may have the sense that I am not one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, I need to pray, Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>My speaking is before You, but it is not by You.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is simply my speaking carried out with a good intention.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But I am the one speaking, Lord, not You.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In ministering to the saints, my desire these days is to point out that the requirement in the New Testament is that we live one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In all that we do and say we need to have the assurance that we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I can testify that when I ask myself how much of my living is actually one spirit with the Lord, I am defeated time and time again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even as I am giving a message, I need to ask if I am truly one spirit with the Lord or just speaking with power from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I have given many messages on walking according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now I wish to emphasize the fact that to walk according to the Spirit means to walk in one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As long as we are one spirit with Him, we are automatically according to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Paul could say, To me to live is Christ, because he walked in one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we are one spirit with Him, we truly live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Walking in the presence of God easily fits in with our natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, it is not according to man s natural concept that believers would be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is easy to understand the word in Exodus about the Lord s presence going with the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We may apply this word to ourselves and realize that as we go to a particular place, the Lord s presence will go with us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, it is not according to our natural concept to think that we should live one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some Christians have gone so far as to say that it is blasphemy to claim that we can be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>According to them, it is simply not possible for sinners ever to become one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Nevertheless, the Bible says clearly, He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Although we may read this word, we may have no response to it, because we are veiled by religious, natural, and traditional concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We may not even have any concern about such a vital matter.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But recently the Lord has brought us to the point where we simply must pay attention to the New Testament requirement to be one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Yes, according to the Old Testament practice, Abraham could walk in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But we are in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>According to God s New Testament economy, the Lord desires to come into us, to become one with us, and to make us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He wants us to be one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>His economy today is that we walk in this one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He walked in one spirit with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When He spoke, the Father spoke in His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He was one with the Father, and the Father was one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Lord lived by His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>He wants those who believe in Him to live in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Therefore, He said, As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The Lord desires not simply that we live in His presence, but that we live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>To live by Him actually means to live one spirit with this living One.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is the New Testament requirement, and this is the first kind of walk by the Spirit covered by Paul in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I hope that many will be impressed with this word concerning living in one spirit with the Lord and will pray, Lord, from now on I would not be satisfied simply with Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Even if I could be as successful in practicing the presence of God as Brother Lawrence was, I would not be satisfied, because I know, Lord, that You would not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>You want to be one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Lord, grant me the grace to be one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In all that we say or do we need to exercise to be one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The more we are one spirit with Him in our daily living, the more we shall enjoy salvation, sanctification, and transformation.</S>
