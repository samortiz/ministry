   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. A CHRISTIAN BEING DELIVERED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM HUMILIATION, POSSESSIONS, AND THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me briefly go over these three things again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Striking the cheek has to do with humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Chinese understand this; so did the Jews and the Romans at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are many records which show that many of the Roman slaves would rather have been killed by their masters than struck on the cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Killing was bearable, but striking the cheek was unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, striking the cheek signifies extreme humiliation; it signifies the greatest shame at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Tunics and cloaks are what man rightfully owns.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among man s possessions, there is hardly anything more rightfully his than his clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even the poorest person wears a tunic and a cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter how insistent a man is in rejecting material enjoyment, he still has to wear a tunic and a cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a very legitimate demand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here is a person who is not asking for your property or your farm but your tunic.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, if he wants to take your tunic, you must take off your cloak first.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, this matter touches one s possessions in the deepest way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If striking the cheek has to do with humiliation, taking away the tunic has to do with one s most essential possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Compelling others to walk is particularly related to the will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I may not intend to take a certain way or go to a certain place, but others compel me to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means I must deny myself to take their way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to bend the will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would like my brothers and sisters to see that Christian reactions have to do with the left cheek, the cloak, and the second mile.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When others strike my right cheek, I turn my left cheek to them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When others want my tunic, I give my cloak as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When others compel me to walk one mile, I walk two miles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that the right cheek has not touched me, the tunic has not touched me, and the one-mile journey has not touched me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why I call this a transcendent reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If my right cheek is struck and I have some feeling about it, I will not turn my left cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If after walking for one mile I have reached my limit, I cannot walk the second mile.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The issue is the kind of reaction we have under such circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christians are those who have been delivered from any feeling of glory and humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are those who have been delivered from the bondage of material possessions and their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are delivered from humiliation, possessions, and the will, these things will never touch us again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE PRIMARY LESSON OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>BEING TO STOP ALL REASONINGS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must learn never to reason before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first lesson of the cross is to not reason.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No one among us should be so low or so fallen as to become a revenger.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, there is no need to talk about the option of taking an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, I am afraid that many people reason and insist on their rights, saying, You should not have struck me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever a person reasons with others, it means that he is touched by the things that happen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord shows us that the proper response to unreasonable evil is unreasonable good.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Others can be unreasonably evil to us, but we return unreasonable good to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first mile is unreasonable enough, but the second mile is even more unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, both are unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Striking the right cheek is unreasonable, but so is turning the left cheek.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Taking away one s tunic is absolutely unreasonable, but so is giving away the cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christians are those who do not reason.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They return unreasonable goodness for unreasonable evil.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should not be trapped in your own reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should not say whether something is reasonable or unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You may say that the first mile is unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But I say that the second mile is even more unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the first mile is unreasonable, the second mile is even more unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you cannot take the first mile, how can you take the second mile?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His children do not react by reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>None of God s children should lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are not in the realm of arguing between right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Reasoning is something outside of a believer s realm.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you fall into reasoning, you have already lost your Christian standing; you are no longer standing on Christian ground.</S>
