<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Keeping the Principle of Jerusalem&#151;<br>Working from the Center to the Circumference</H2><P>Today we need to consider afresh the principle of Jerusalem. God's work began from Jerusalem (Acts 1:4, 8). The word of the Lord was that the gospel should spread from Jerusalem. In the Bible, Jerusalem represents God's work. God set up Jerusalem as the center of the work. In God's eyes, all the apostles should remain in Jerusalem (Acts 1:4; 8:1, 14, 25). We will not take back a single word of what we have said in Hankow before. No doubt the church is local. But in God's eyes, there are centers in His work. What we spoke of in Hankow was the condition of the local churches when they are matured. The failure of our work in these years is that we pass on the authority to the local churches before they are matured. According to God's order, there is first Jerusalem, and then the local churches. Our failure today lies in the fact that we have the local churches first without having a Jerusalem. The order of the Lord's way is first Jerusalem, then Samaria, and then the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). Jerusalem came first, then came the local churches. In the past we did not see this. This is why, though we had so many small churches, we did not learn coordination, and the local churches became little kingdoms under the hands of one worker with two or three responsible brothers. The problem with the Lord's testimony in the past is that we did not begin from Jerusalem.</P><P>Today, we have to learn first to stand on the position of oneness and to begin from Jerusalem. If we do not go back to the principle of Jerusalem, we will not have a proper way to go on.</P><P>Some Bible expositors say that it was wrong for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem. They say that the apostles should not have remained in Jerusalem. But in the Bible, we do not see the Lord asking them to leave Jerusalem. It is right for the apostles to remain in Jerusalem. Later, when they went out, it was not because of persecution, but because everywhere there were those who called on the name of the Lord. Something happened in Samaria. That was why Jerusalem sent John and Peter out. After they went out for a little while, they came back to Jerusalem (Acts 8:14, 25). God needs a Jerusalem also in China. The way of the work is that there must first be a Jerusalem. In Jerusalem there were many co-workers, and there was the church. There was much opportunity to learn the lessons. First there was Jerusalem, and then there was Antioch. Even Paul had to go first to Jerusalem to learn the lessons (Acts 9:26-29). It is true that Jerusalem was a church, but it was different from an ordinary local church. In Jerusalem, there were the apostles and the elders (Acts 15:2). But in Philippi there were only the elders and the deacons (Phil. 1:1). It seems that in Jerusalem the local church and the center of the work are at the same place.</P><P>Today, whether we are driven from our city by outward persecutions, or some go out because they decide to migrate, or to spread out, we have to remember that there is the principle of Jerusalem. The Lord's word says that the gospel is to be preached from Jerusalem unto the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8). This is a non-stopping principle; it continues until the ends of the earth are reached. If we want a new start, we have to have a Jerusalem. Unless we have a Jerusalem, there is no way to go on in the work.</P>
