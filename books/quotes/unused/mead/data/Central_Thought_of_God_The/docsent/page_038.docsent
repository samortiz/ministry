   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING A LIVING COMPOSITION OF LIVING PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us see what the New Jerusalem, the divine building, the holy city, is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, this holy city is a living composition of living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is built with living persons as materials, being composed of the saints in the Old Testament time as well as the saints in the New Testament time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that the New Jerusalem is a composition of living persons because the divine record tells us that the twelve gates of the city bear the names of the twelve tribes of Israel 21:12 and that the twelve foundations of this city bear the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb v. 14 . The twelve tribes of Israel are the representatives of the Old Testament saints, and the twelve apostles are the representatives of all the New Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why we say that the New Jerusalem is a composition of all the saints in the Old Testament time as well as in the New Testament time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From now on you should never believe that in this universe God is building a material place with material things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After creating the heavens, the earth, and all things, God has not had a resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God will not be satisfied with a physical place as His resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Isaiah 66:1 we are told that even heaven, where God's throne is, is not God's resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is God's resting place?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the following verse, it is the contrite spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God wants a living dwelling place, that is, a dwelling place built with living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was young, I sat at the feet of some older saints who taught the Bible in the way of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day I heard a message saying, "The heavenly mansion which the Lord is preparing for us must be a wonderful place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord told us that as soon as He finishes building it, He will come back to take us there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since He has been gone for nearly two thousand years and has not come back yet, it must be that the heavenly mansion has not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After such a long time the Lord still has not finished the building, so imagine how wonderful that mansion will be!"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time I was so childish that I believed what I heard, and I even was excited, thinking that each of us will be given a mansion, as we sang in certain hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This concept concerning the New Jerusalem is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is after a living dwelling place with living persons as living materials.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Christianity today Christians have a very wrong concept concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They consider that the church is a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is absolutely and seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is not a physical building but a building with living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is a living composition with the living believers as the living members.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is not a physical house; the church is a living house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same principle applies to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The New Jerusalem is not a physical building but a living building with living members, living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord does not want to have a physical mansion as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, the Lord desires to have a living composition of a living group of living persons, redeemed, saved, regenerated, transformed, changed in every respect, and composed and built up together as a living dwelling place for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the resting place of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the highest thought, the thought on the highest plane, concerning the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In certain places some friends asked me, "Brother Lee, would you please tell us where we Christians will be after we die?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I said, "Brothers, there is no need for you to worry about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Surely you and I are precious in the Lord's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord will keep us in the best place."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brothers and sisters, we do not need to worry about where we will be in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, the Lord is very concerned today about His spiritual, living dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is seeking after a living habitation that is composed of, built up together with, all the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The New Jerusalem is the bride of Christ and the wife of Christ Rev 21:2, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can a physical mansion be a bride or a wife?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you get married, will you marry a house or a mansion?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, you will marry a living person, a person as a living composition of living members.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can a physical mansion which is without feelings and thoughts match you?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the same way, how can a physical mansion without a heart, a mind, a thought, and a desire be the counterpart to match the living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That is ridiculous.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is going to marry not a physical mansion but His redeemed ones, who are composed together as His bride, His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The apostle John tells us that all the people given by God the Father to the Lord, the Son, are the bride as the increase of the Lord John 3:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The apostle Paul also says that he betrothed us as pure virgins to Christ as our Husband 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then in Ephesians 5 we are told that husbands should love their wives just as the Lord loves the church v. 25 . These portions of the Word show us clearly that the bride of Christ is not a physical house but a living composition of the redeemed ones.</S>
