   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INTRINSIC SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider the truth of the resurrection of Christ as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is very common among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every Christian can say that resurrection is to be raised up or to rise up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we need to see that resurrection implies three big things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Birth of the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, in resurrection, Christ was born to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How many have ever heard that resurrection was a birth to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Who has ever thought that besides the incarnation, Christ had another birth in His resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 13:33 says, "That God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, You are My Son; today I have begotten You.'"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today in this verse was the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ was begotten by God in resurrection to be God's firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How many Christians have heard this truth?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this truth is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ was the only begotten Son of God even before His incarnation John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His incarnation was the coming of the only begotten Son of God 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This Son of God was incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But Acts 13:33 unveils that in resurrection God begot Christ to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Regeneration of the Many Sons of God</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Also, the Bible tells us that we, the God-chosen people, were regenerated in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In resurrection God begot a Son, Jesus Christ, and in resurrection God regenerated many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This shows us that the resurrection of Christ was a great delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In that same delivery, the Firstborn was Christ, and this firstborn Brother had many "twins" to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the unique resurrection Christ was born and we were regenerated, so we were His "twins" in the same delivery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although this is in the Bible, who has seen it or even heard it?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I can never deny this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is like saying that I can never deny America because I am here in America.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to our natural idea, we were regenerated on a specific date in time after Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Bible tells us that we were regenerated when Christ was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a difference there is between the natural understanding and the unveiled truth!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Last Adam Becoming a Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we come to the third great thing accomplished in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have seen that in the same resurrection, Christ was born to be the firstborn Son of God, and we the God-chosen people were born to be the many sons of God, who are the "twins" of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Also, in this same resurrection, Christ became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The holy Scripture says in 1 Corinthians 15:45b, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you ask someone what has been accomplished by God in Christ's resurrection, he may simply say that God raised up Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely this is fundamental and according to the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in the same Bible there are three marvelous verses which show us the intrinsic significance of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, Acts 13:33 tells us that in resurrection God accomplished a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In resurrection God begot Christ to be His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then 1 Peter 1:3 tells us that through resurrection God regenerated us, the millions of God-chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was such a great delivery, a great begetting, in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Third, 1 Corinthians 15:45b tells us that in resurrection the last Adam, the man Jesus, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These three great things took place and were accomplished in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The shallow teaching of Christianity tells us things mostly according to the black and white.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we have realized more by our further and deeper study.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have been studying this Book further and further for over sixty-nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Gradually my study of the Bible has been getting deeper and deeper and higher and higher.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today my study of the Bible concerning resurrection has become a crystallization.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This crystallization is that Christ's resurrection is not merely God's raising Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's raising up Jesus Christ from the dead was God's act.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this one divine act, God accomplished three big things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He begot not His only Son, but His firstborn Son; He begot His many sons in this one delivery; and He made this Jesus Christ, who had just been begotten of God, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Three great accomplishments took place in one act.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christianity teaches people mostly to behave according to the printed pages of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is nothing wrong with this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But they have never seen that in the raising up of Christ, in this divine act, God accomplished three big things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He produced the firstborn Son, the many sons, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The entire economy of God is carried out by these three items.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you were to delete Acts 13:33, 1 Peter 1:3, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b from the Bible, the firstborn Son of God, the many sons of God, and the life-giving Spirit would be absent from the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even though these items concerning the resurrection of Christ are in the Bible, they are mostly absent from the fundamental teaching of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without these major items of the Lord's resurrection, there would be no church, no Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If there were nothing in the Bible revealing the firstborn Son of God, the many sons of God, and the life-giving Spirit, there would be no economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These items are new to many Christians, but they are not new to the Bible.</S>
