   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Can Self-examination</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Enable Us to Know Ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even if we examine ourselves, our experience tells us that we still cannot know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us see what the Bible says about us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jeremiah 17:9 says: "The heart is deceitful above all things / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since our heart is deceitful, our self-examination will not be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because we are using a deceitful heart to examine ourselves, we cannot avoid being deceived by this deceitful heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Perhaps you are wrong, but your heart may tell you that you are not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Or perhaps you are not wrong, but because of some weaknesses, your heart may tell you that you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the heart were proper, then it could be used as a standard; but, since the heart is deceitful, how can it be used as a standard?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you use an inaccurate standard to examine yourself, surely it will be hard for you not to be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A man was installing a chimney, and after he measured it with his ruler, he told the metal worker to make it ten feet long.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When it was finished and delivered to him, no matter how he measured, it was one foot too long.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He complained to the metal worker, and the metal worker measured it with his own ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was exactly ten feet.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, the installer insisted that it was one foot too long.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, the metal worker looked at the man's ruler and found that one-tenth of the man's ruler had been sawed off by his son who had played with it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the chimney always measured one foot too long.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would examine ourselves, we must first ask whether or not we are trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been corrupted and in the sight of God are very evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we examine ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many think that self-examination is a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But let me tell you: self-examination is a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to know that the structure of our inward psychological parts is complex.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our desire, thought, feeling, and other manifestations of our heart are very complex.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot clearly analyze how they influence and interact one with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In such a complicated condition, even though we can examine ourselves, self-examination will never give us accurate self-knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While you are examining your feelings, you do not know how your feelings are affected by and connected with all the other areas.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, knowledge gained from your feeling is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only a little influence can change your feeling completely.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times concerning a certain matter we lose the proper view and do not have the accurate knowledge regarding our own intentions because there is a little hidden sin, wrong thought, or little prejudice inside us or because of our disposition by birth and innumerable other little causes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Any knowledge which we derive from ourselves is inaccurate because it is so complicated and untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We often come across a situation in which a person is very good on some point but does not know it; rather, he feels that he is weak on that point.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, he is weak on another point, yet he does not realize it but considers himself to be very good on that point.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We often see this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows us that, even though man may examine himself, it is still impossible for him to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man cannot know himself through self-examination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have a friend who talked very much about Christian love after he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to his view he considered himself to have much love, but in his home he was not at peace with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Think about it!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If one wishes to examine himself, is his self reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If his self is not trustworthy, then examining himself is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Psalm 19:12 asks, "Who can discern his errors?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one can know.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot know for sure our errors by ourselves.</S>
