 SUCH AS <em>LIFE LESSONS, TRUTH LESSONS,<br />
</em> THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES, OR OTHER<br />
SPIRITUAL PUBLICATIONS IN TRUTH OR IN LIFE</h2>
<p>For the long run, we need to use some materials such as <em>Life Lessons, Truth Lessons,</em> the Life-study Messages, or other spiritual publications in truth or in life. We have pointed out that this kind of material can be considered as a &ldquo;cane&rdquo; in the initial stage to help us in the meetings. For many years we have been in an old way of meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen, so we must use a &ldquo;cane&rdquo; to help us have a new start. I feel that it is best to use <em>Life Lessons</em> first and after a couple of months to use <em>Truth Lessons</em> since they are much deeper and richer.</p>
<p>The new ones that we contact will be from different backgrounds. Some who have a high education will like to read things. You can give them <em>Life Lessons,</em> but they may feel that this is not sufficient to nourish them. They may want to have some strong food. If you give them <em>Truth Lessons,</em> they may feel very good at first because this is deeper. But after a while they may want you to give them something even richer than this. Then you can give them the Life-study Messages. This will satisfy their hunger. Some new ones will like to read to such an extent. Many people are tired of reading the newspapers. They want to read something in a new field. They will be so happy to read the Life-study of Matthew or Genesis. This is not too deep or hard for them because they have such a large capacity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOTHING BEING DONE IN LEGALITY OR FORMALITY<br />
WITHOUT THE LIVING FLEXIBILITY</h2>
<p>You should not do anything in the meetings in legality or formality without the living flexibility. Suppose you have been meeting in a certain home for fifty minutes and a little girl in the family turns on the television. Would you stop it? Most of us would think that the television being on would kill the meeting. But I would say that it is better not to stop it. You have to learn the skill to turn the meeting back to the Spirit from the television. You can even use what they are seeing on the television, whether it is good or bad, to turn the meeting back. Turn the meeting back wisely. Because we have been drugged with the religious thought and concept, we like to be legal. We always like to see things moving in the lane of religion. We all need a change in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF THE SICKNESSES, SUFFERINGS,<br />
 TROUBLES, PROBLEMS, AND PHYSICAL NEEDS<br />
OF THE NEW ONES IN A BALANCED WAY<br />
FOR THEIR BENEFIT, EDIFICATION, AND BUILDING UP</h2>
<p>We should take care of the sicknesses, sufferings, troubles, problems, and physical needs of the new ones in a balanced way for their benefit, edification, and building up. Of course, our work is not a work of charity, but a work to bring God&rsquo;s salvation to the sinners, to impart the pneumatic Christ into the believing ones, to minister the divine life to them that they may grow in Christ, and to build up the local church for the building up of the Body of Christ. Yet in carrying out such a divine work for the testimony of Jesus Christ, we have to help the ones who are under our work in their sicknesses, sufferings, troubles, problems, and physical needs. We have to learn how to stand on the Lord&rsquo;s word and exercise our faith and even lay our hands on the sick ones to heal their sickness. We have to learn also to share their sufferings, troubles, and problems by praying for them and doing the best to comfort them and whatever we can in the capacity that the Lord gives us to take care of their circumstances. We also have to help them in their necessities materially after the Lord&rsquo;s leading and according to the prosperity by which the Lord has blessed us (Acts 11:29).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
