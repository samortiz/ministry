<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF LIFE</h2><p>When a brother stands up to speak, others can tell whether he knows doctrines or life. If he speaks doctrines, he has to be cautious about what he speaks. Many people carefully word their speaking; there is no danger of making any errors. Their words are full of logic, sense, and reason. But these are merely theological teachings. Today speakers like to speak with clarity, and listeners like to hear words of clarity. But a speaking that is in life does not depend on perception, reason, logic, or classification. It depends on the dividing of the soul and the spirit.</p><p>Let me illustrate by an example. Andrew Murray once wrote a book on sanctification. But there was no conclusion to the subject of sanctification. After a person reads this book, he still may not know what sanctification is, yet he will receive the help. Mrs. Penn-Lewis, Oswald Chambers, and many others are not exactly accurate when it comes to using verses, yet their messages dispense life to others. Hundreds and thousands of men may quote verses better than they did, but they do not have the power of the Spirit. Some people are very accurate in their use of verses; they are careful to point out which passages are for the sinners, which passages are for the Christians, and which passages are for the Jews. But there is neither life nor spirit in their speaking. Some may not be able to give a complete message, yet they supply others with spirit and life. The outstanding thing about theology is its systematization of God's Word and the exposition of it. The goal of theology is to safeguard anyone from misunderstanding God's Word. However, the Bible never provides systematic judgment on such doctrines as salvation or sanctification. It does not explain itself, nor is it afraid of being misunderstood. The Bible does not lead men to God's Word through the mind, but through the spirit. The former line brings profit to the mind, while the latter line reaps profit in spirit and in life.</p><p>I once asked Miss M. E. Barber if there were any books on the cross that I could read. She answered, "Yes. But at your present stage, you cannot read them, and it would be unprofitable for you to read them." I could not hold back my curiosity, and a few days later I learned the names of the books in the course of our conversation. Later, someone gave me copies of those books, and I read right through them. On the one hand, I got some help, but on the other hand, I was greatly disappointed because the books did not answer my questions concerning the cross. I wished that the books had been written in a systematic way, but they were not written this way. My mind tried to sort out the theology and the doctrines, but God was trying to give me life. The books by Madam Guyon, which Brother Yu translated, do not contain much Bible exposition. But after one reads them, he receives the help. When one reads these books, he gets nourishment in life. But when he reads books on knowledge, he receives no nourishment in life. As servants of the Lord we should supply others with life and should not merely teach others doctrines.</p><p>Perhaps I should criticize myself a little. The Spiritual Man was published as a result of outward demands. As far as I was concerned, I was not that qualified to write that book. At that time the doctor said that I had only a few months more to live, and my thought was to put down what I had learned from the Lord. (Originally, I had thought of writing a very comprehensive exposition on the Bible, expounding all the subjects that men do not understand, could not understand, or would not understand.) I have decided not to publish this book again. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with The Spiritual Man. The problem is that the book is too complete; it contains theology and answers. As a result it is somewhat unspiritual&mdash;this is where the problem lies. God is after broken vessels, not nice vessels. God has no intention to see a book or a sermon so complete that a man can find all the answers without the need of the Spirit. The Lord knows the human weaknesses in every book and every sermon. This is why we need the leading of the Holy Spirit from within.</p><p>There are many passages in the Bible that we do not understand. We should not try deliberately to understand them, and even if we try to understand them, they will be of little profit to us. The Bible is for the nourishment of our life, not for knowledge. For example, we do not need a complete exposition on the doctrine of salvation. Even if the exposition is very complete, others may not be saved by it. Many people do not know very much, but they know that they are saved. Some think that after a man is saved, he should know whether or not "the root of sin" is eradicated. But all I know is that there is the law of sin in man, and that I cannot overcome it; I need God's law of life to overcome this law of sin within me.</p>
