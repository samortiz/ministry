   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX 2 Issue No. 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All questions regarding the Bible and spiritual matters can be directed to the editor.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will do our best to answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we will not respond to fruitless questions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Question: How should we explain the Trinity?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is there one God, or are there three Gods?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rue, Hangchow</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Answer: God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the word triune is not found in the Bible, this is definitely a major teaching in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible testifies everywhere that the Father is God 2 Tim 1:2, etc. . The Bible also attests that the Son is God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hebrews 1:8 says, "Of the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever....'"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows us clearly that the Son is God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 1:1 says clearly that "the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus Himself also said, "I and the Father are one" John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can see from the Holy Spirit's source and work that He is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, the Bible says explicitly that the Holy Spirit is God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 5:3-4 says, "But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit...?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have not lied to men but to God."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From the above verses we can see that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then why do we say that He is the Triune God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Timothy 2:5 says, "For there is one God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is one God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since there are not three gods, there must be a Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This conclusion does not contradict the biblical teaching of one God, nor does it annul the divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the most scriptural expression.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the doctrine of the Trinity is most mysterious, and we can only know about it without understanding it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should remain quietly before Him and meditate on His greatness, rather than trying in vain to understand what God has not revealed to us Deut 29:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Note: It is better to say the Triune God than to say the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Question: Daniel 9:24 mentions the seventy weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 25 of chapter nine mentions the seven weeks and the sixty-two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Does the "middle of the week" in 9:27 refer to the tribulation, or does it refer to the Savior's time on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rue, Hangchow</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Answer: The seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24 cover a span of 490 years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These seventy weeks are divided into three periods.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>1 The seven weeks, which is 49 years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This refers to the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>2 The next 62 weeks, which together with the first seven weeks is 483 years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that from the time of the decree for the rebuilding of the city until the death of Christ is 483 years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This has fully been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The decree for the rebuilding of the city Ezra 1:1-2 was in 454 B.C., while the Lord's death was in A.D. 29.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The two added together equal exactly 483 years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>3 The last week, which is seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Originally, this week was immediately after the 483 years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But there is an insertion of the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the fulfillment of this week will take place when the tribulation comes at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to determine if the "middle of the week" refers to the tribulation or to the time of our Savior on earth, we have to see who the "he" refers to in 9:27.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If it refers to Antichrist, then the "middle of the week" has to refer to the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the "he" refers to Christ, then the "middle of the week" has to refer to the time of our Savior on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verse 26 we see two persons: Christ as the Messiah and Antichrist as the prince.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who does the "he" in verse 27 refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The "prince" is mentioned after the "Messiah," and since the "he" comes after the "prince," this "he" must refer to Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the "middle of the week" has to refer to the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>THE ORIGIN OF SATAN</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Question: Where did Satan come from?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Answer: Satan was an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Through his pride, he wanted to become equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result, he was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please read Ezekiel 28:11-19 and Isaiah 14:12-14.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both the king of Tyre and Lucifer refer to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Pride has destroyed Satan, and it is still destroying many other people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What a pity!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>THE SPIRIT OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Question: After Adam was driven out of the garden, his spirit had lost its function and was no longer able to have intimate fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But he had not forgotten the Lord, for in Genesis 4:1 it says, "I have gotten a man from the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Was that a mere inspiration?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Lee, Kiangsu</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Answer: Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although the spirit of Adam had lost its function and could no longer fellowship with God, his soul was still active and could remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Remembering is a function of the mind, and the mind is a part of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Not only is this true with Adam, but it is true with the few generations after Adam also.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The endings "-el" and "-ah" in Mehujael and Methuselah both mean God in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The same thing is true with modern man; the spirit of many backsliding believers has long ceased functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Their sins have stopped them from having any fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Yet in their mouth and in their mind, they still remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Of course, the memory of the Lord in our soul will not help us to have fellowship with God.</S>
