   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Dropping the Divisive Things and Coming Back to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the spring of 1963 after I was first sent by the Lord to minister in the United States, I was invited to speak to three Brethren assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Brethren assemblies have been divided into many divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Brethren started the church life in 1828, but after only ninety years, they were divided into one hundred fifty divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From that time until today there have been even more divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today there may be a thousand divisions among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One Brethren assembly was divided over the playing of the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some insisted on using a piano, while others opposed the use of a piano.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, that assembly was divided into two assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I spoke with those assemblies, I was very bold to tell them that they needed to drop all their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I said, "The reason that you are so divided is that you take care only of teachings and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must drop all the doctrines and come back to Christ as life."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This offended them, so immediately after my message some of them rebuked me to my face.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not want to be a troublemaker, but I have a real burden concerning the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we all are for life, we are one, but if we are for doctrines, gifts, or anything other than life, we will be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are here only for life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus said that He came that we might have life and have it more abundantly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is so that we can be one flock.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can be flocked together by Christ as our life, not by anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus is the door, not for us to go into heaven, but for us to come out of anything that holds us back from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Jesus is the door to release us, to set us free, from all kinds of folds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then after we come out of the fold, He is not only our life but also our pasture and our Shepherd vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the door, He is the pasture, He is the life, and He is the Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we are out of many folds to be in the flock, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are the flock by the life of Jesus, and as the flock we are feeding on Jesus as the green pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oneness in the Divine Life and Nature with the Divine Position to Express the Father</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 17 the Lord prayed that we all would be one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>11, 21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In what way can we all be one?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 22 says, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The glory that the Father gave to the Son is the divine life with the divine nature plus the divine position for the Son to express the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This glory has been given to us by the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now we have the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine position.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is ours by our divine birth, by being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As children of God, we have the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine position to express the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we all would drop our concepts and simply be for the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine position to express the Father, we all would be one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can never be one by doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can never be one by opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two brothers may have differing opinions about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One brother may think that the other brother's hair is too long, while the other brother thinks that the first brother's hair is too short.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One brother thinks that the other should shave, but the other brother thinks that to shave too often is worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One brother feels that everyone should wear a tie to the meetings, while the other brother feels that this is too worldly because Jesus never wore a tie.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all have our opinions, so what shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must drop our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way to drop our opinions is by taking Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without taking Christ as life, we may drop one opinion and pick up another opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will have one opinion after another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must drop the opinions and come back to the glory that the Lord Jesus has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This glory is the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine position to express the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hallelujah, we have God's life, we have God's nature, and we have the position as God's children to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we care only for this glory, we all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Long hair or short hair, wide neckties or narrow neckties, shaving or not shaving all these things make no difference.</S>
