<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE ORDER AND THE AUTHORITY<br />
IN THE BODY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:21; 4:16; Col. 2:19</h1>
<p>We have already seen that in order to have the fullness of God, we need to have God&rsquo;s authority, and that in order to have the coordination of the Body, we need to hold to the Head. When we put these two together, we come to the following conclusion: there is order in the Body, and the coordination of the Body is mainly in this order.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY</h2>
<p>All of God&rsquo;s creation is an expression of His sovereign authority. In other words, we see God&rsquo;s sovereign authority in all His creation. For example, in astronomy the revolutions of the stars or the planets demonstrate the absolute authority of God. Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ upholds and bears &ldquo;all things by the word of His power.&rdquo; In the universe we see God&rsquo;s sovereignty in great matters, such as astronomy, as well as in small matters, such as the growth of a blade of grass. Many laws and principles speak of God&rsquo;s sovereignty. Without His sovereignty, there can be no laws or principles. The laws and principles of the universe depend on God&rsquo;s authority and are the expression of God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>If everything in a place is in chaos, surely there is no authority, no sovereignty. However, when everything is neat and orderly, this is an indication that there is authority, there is sovereignty. Although the universe has been corrupted, it still maintains a certain degree of orderliness; everything is on track and in good order. This speaks of God&rsquo;s sovereign authority. Where there is order, there is authority. Likewise, the most crucial matter in the Body of Christ is to be in order. When there is order, there is coordination and no confusion. The matter of order is a matter of authority.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY NEEDING TO BE UPRIGHT</h2>
<p>A body is no longer a body if there is no order; it will fall apart and will no longer be able to stand. A person is strongest when he is in an upright position. He is most powerful when standing. Standing is an expression of being upright. When a person is sitting, he is not fully upright; when he lies down, he is even less so and is actually horizontal. When a human body falls apart, it is no longer upright but flat, and all the parts are useless. Hence, a body is in confusion and falls apart once it loses its order; it becomes flat and useless. A flat body is not only without power but also loses its functions. A strong body is upright. An upright body depends on order, and this order is authority.</p>
<p>Outwardly, it seems as if the human body is holding up the head; however, the body cannot stand if the head is removed. This is marvelous. Thus, it is hard for us to determine whether the body holds up the head, or the head maintains the body. If we cut off an arm from the body, the body can still stand, but if the head is cut off, the body can no longer stand. Therefore, the body subsists in the head. If the head loses its position and order, there is no authority in the body; the body will be paralyzed and will collapse, becoming useless. This is true not only in the relationship between the body and the head; it is even more so in the relationship among all the members of a body. We cannot place the feet on top of the shoulder; neither can we place the shoulder under the feet. If someone tries to do this, his body will fall apart. Therefore, from the example of the human body we can clearly see that there is the matter of order in the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUBMITTING TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEAD</h2>
<p>All believers must submit to the Head and be under the authority of the Head. Ephesians 4:15 and Colossians 2:19 say that we need to hold to the Head; this implies authority. Our holding to the Head and growing up into the Head in all things is our submission to the authority of the Head. If these two verses did not imply authority, there would be no need to speak of the Head; it would be sufficient to speak only of Christ. However, these two verses do not speak of Christ only in relation to life; they speak of the Head in relation to authority. Being the Head is a matter of authority. We need to grow up into Christ and also into the Head. Our growing up into the Head is our submission to the authority of the Head, allowing the Head to have authority in every matter.</p>
<p>Some saints may allow the Lord to have authority in their service to God and to the Lord but not in their finances and family life. They may allow the Lord to have authority over one matter but not over another. Although we are merely human, to God we are troublesome and complicated; it is not easy for us to yield the authority to the Lord in every matter. We may allow the Lord to rule over our clothing but not over our shoes. As we advance in the Lord, we will grow up into the Head in all things and allow Him to have the authority. If we would know Him as the Head, we must know His authority. If there are any matters that are not under His authority, any matters where He is not the Head, this indicates that we are holding the authority in our own hands and that we have enthroned ourselves. We will have problems in the Body of Christ if we do not submit to the Head in all things. If we do not keep the proper order in our relationship with the Head, if the question of our position before the Head is not fully resolved, we will have problems in the Body.</p>
<p>Whether our coordination with other members in the Body is harmonious depends on our position before the Head. Do we submit ourselves to His authority, or do we stand on equal ground with Him? Do we completely or partially submit ourselves to Him? As soon as we have problems with the Head, we have problems in the Body. We should not expect to have a good relationship with the members when we do not have a good relationship with the Head. Only when our relationship with the Head is proper can our relationship with the other members also be proper. Ephesians 4:15 says that we &ldquo;grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.&rdquo; This implies authority. We need to know the Head, honor the Head, allow Him to be the Lord, and allow Him to have the authority and ground in us. If this is unresolved, we will have problems with the Body. Even if we are at peace with one another in the church, there will still be complaints and problems within us.</p>
