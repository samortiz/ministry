[4]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE ONE THE PURPOSE OF THE VITAL GROUPS Scripture Reading: Matt 18:15-22; 2 Tim 2:22; Rom 14:17; Eph 2:14-17; 2 Pet 1:8 OUTLINE To live the kingdom life Matt 18:15-22: The kingdom life is the God-man life.
[5]  What is covered in Matthew 18:15-22 unveils to us how to take care of a sinning brother in a vital group: Go and reprove him between you and him alone.
[6]  I am thankful to the Lord that He has restored this fellowship on the vital groups.
[7]  This has been frustrated by Satan for more than two years.
[8]  Many times we feel that a certain saint is a hopeless case, and we stop with this feeling toward him in our small groups.
[9]  We always end our small group meeting in verse 17.
[10]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWO THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE VITAL GROUPS 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:15-16; Matt 5:1; 28:19; Acts 1:8 OUTLINE The believers in Christ John 3:15-16: Transferred from Adam into Christ 1 Cor 15:22.
[11]  Regenerated to be a new creation in Christ and all the old things have been washed away 2 Cor 5:17; Titus 3:5.
[12]  United with Christ in His eternal life a union in the divine life.
[13]  The disciples of Christ Matt 5:1; 28:19 , discipled through: Christ's human living on the earth, as the model of a God-man living God by denying Himself in humanity John 5:19, 30 , revolutionizing their concept concerning man Phil 3:10; 1:21a .
[14]  In the next message we will fellowship concerning the members of Christ, the brothers of Christ, and the prophets of God.
[15]  THE DISCIPLES OF CHRIST, DISCIPLED THROUGH CHRIST'S HUMAN LIVING, CRUCIFIXION, AND RESURRECTION
[16]  They were discipled through Christ's crucifixion to annul their human life for them to live the divine life Gal 2:20 .
[17]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE THREE THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE VITAL GROUPS 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 12:5; 8:29; John 20:17; 1 Cor 14:1,31 OUTLINE The members of Christ Rom 12:5: The organic salvation of God is with Christ as the center and His Body as the spreading.
[18]  The members of Christ constitute His Body for His spreading by His multiplication.
[19]  Such multiplications spread God through speaking for the increase of Christ His bride John 3:29-30: He speaks the words of God for the dispensing of the Spirit without measure John 3:34.
[20]  In the previous message we saw the first three items of the constituents of the vital groups: the believers in Christ, the disciples of Christ, and the witnesses of Christ.
[21]  In message one we pointed out that to live the church life, we have to pursue with those who call on the name of the Lord out of a pure heart 2 Tim 2:22 .
[22]  Also, we have to learn how to enjoy Christ as the Spirit in our spirit to be the abiding grace for our enjoyment 4:22 .
[23]  According to 1 Corinthians 14 the meetings of the believers should be meetings for God's speaking.
[24]  The first verse of 1 Corinthians 14 says that we should pursue love and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that we may prophesy, speaking God, speaking for God, and speaking forth God.
[25]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE FOUR GOD'S NEW CREATION BECOMING GOD'S ORACLE FOR HIS DISPENSING AND SPREADING OUTLINE As the constituents of the vital groups, we need to remember and realize that we are God's regenerated new creation, united with Christ in His divine life, joined to Christ as one spirit.
[26]  Discipled from being a natural man to being a God-man, living the divine life by denying our natural life according to the model of Christ as the first God-man.
[27]  To be His brothers participating with Him in the divine sonship with the divine right to express God mainly through speaking for the dispensing of God through His oracle.
[28]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE FIVE THE GREAT COMMISSION OF CHRIST IN RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Acts 1:2-3; Matt 28:16-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47; Acts 2:32-36; 5:30-32; 22:15; 1:8 OUTLINE The Christ in resurrection: The Christ in His incarnation: To bring God into man, making God and man as one.
[29]  To live in the human life to express God, especially to express the attributes of God in His human virtues.
[30]  The Christ in His resurrection: Through His death Christ entered into His resurrection to carry out His ministry in the stage of His inclusion.
[31]  The commission of Christ: After Christ entered into His resurrection from the stage of His incarnation into the stage of His inclusion, He remained among His apostles for forty days to prepare them for carrying out His heavenly ministry in His resurrection Acts 1:2-3.
[32]  The content of this message is much more difficult than that of the foregoing ones.
[33]  Many in the past have used the term the great commission to describe the Lord's charge to His disciples before He ascended.
[34]  The great commission the Lord gave us is for us to disciple the nations and teach them the teachings of Christ Matt 28:19-20 .
[35]  THE BASIC WAY ORDAINED BY GOD IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST TO CONSUMMATE HIS ETERNAL GOAL THE NEW JERUSALEM 1 OUTLINE In Christ's ministry for carrying out God's eternal economy: Shepherding outwardly: Seeking the lost sheep for His rejoicing and the joy in heaven Luke 15:4-7.
[36]  If we do not do this, we owe something to the Lord, to the saints, and to all the sinners on this earth Rom 1:14 .
[37]  Christ is the great Shepherd through whom God, based upon His redeeming blood of the eternal covenant, perfects the sheep of God, the churches, in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight Heb 13:20-21 .
[38]  As the second Comforter, Christ is the Spirit of reality who comes not only to be with us but also to be in us, the redeemed ones of God v. 17 . Then the Son in whom we believe is in the Father and we are in Him and He is in us v. 20 . These four ins show the Triune God incorporated with His redeemed and transformed people to be one entity.
[39]  John 1 through 7 is concerning the flowing Triune God to be the living water for the enjoyment of the believers in Christ.
[40]  All these divine and mystical teachings of our great Shepherd and Comforter are not only His unveiling and enlightening but also His nourishing to us for our growth and maturity in His divine life that the eternal economy of God may be consummated through us.
[41]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SEVEN SHEPHERDING AND TEACHING THE OBLIGATION OF THE VITAL GROUPS
[42]  THE BASIC WAY ORDAINED BY GOD IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST TO CONSUMMATE HIS ETERNAL GOAL THE NEW JERUSALEM 2 OUTLINE In the gifts among the gifted persons given by Christ the ascended Head to the churches for the building up of His Body, the essential functions are: Shepherding: Among the four kinds of gifted persons, the ministry of the first three, that is, of the apostles, prophets, and evangelists, depends upon shepherding.
[43]  In the previous message we saw that shepherding and teaching are in Christ's ministry for carrying out God's eternal economy.
[44]  In this message we want to see the shepherding and teaching in the gifted persons and in the eldership.
[45]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE EIGHT LOVE PREVAILS OUTLINE God is love; we love because He first loved us 1 John 4:8, 19.
[46]  God's predestination of us unto the divine sonship was motivated by the divine love Eph 1:4-5.
[47]  God's giving of His only begotten Son to us that we may be saved from perdition judicially through His death and have the eternal life organically in His resurrection was motivated by the divine love John 3:16; 1 John 4:9-10.
[48]  God's love motivates us, His children, to love our enemies that we may be perfect as He is; He loves the fallen human race, who became His enemies, by causing His sun signifying Christ to rise on the evil and the good indiscriminately and sending rain signifying the Spirit on the just and the unjust equally; thus, we may become the sons of the heavenly Father who are sanctified from the tax collectors and the Gentiles Matt 5:43-48.
[49]  Ephesians 1:4-5 says that God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world "to be holy and without blemish before Him in love, predestinating us unto sonship."
[50]  THE ONE WHO DOES NOT LOVE ABIDING IN DEATH
[51]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE NINE CHRIST AS THE SON OF MAN CHERISHING US AND AS THE SON OF GOD NOURISHING US OUTLINE Illustration one: Christ as the Son of Man became the Lamb of God to take away our sin John 1:29 cherishing.
[52]  Christ as the Son of God became the life-giving Spirit to give life to us and transform us John 1:32-34, 42 nourishing.
[53]  Illustration two: Christ as the Son of Man, in the form of the serpent, destroyed the old serpent, the source of sin, through His redeeming death John 3:14; Heb 2:14 cherishing.
[54]  Christ as the Son of God, sent by God as a gift, gave her to drink the water of life which springs up into eternal life John 4:10-14 nourishing.
[55]  The title of this message is very simple but what it conveys is inexhaustible.
[56]  I. ILLUSTRATION ONE A. Christ as the Son of Man Becoming the Lamb of God
[57]  ILLUSTRATION FOUR A. Christ as the Son of Man Having Been Designated by God to Judge All the People of the World
[58]  Christ as the Son of Man has been designated by God to judge all the people of the world, the living and the dead John 5:27-29; Acts 17:31; 10:42; 2 Tim 4:1; Matt 25:31.
[59]  The judgment of Christ has been preached to the sinners as a cherishing to them that they might repent unto God and receive Christ as the Son of God to have His eternal life.
[60]  B. God Sending His Son That We May Have Life
[61]  God sent His Son to us that we may have life and live through Him in His divinity 1 John 4:9 nourishing.
[62]  This is confirmed by John 3:16: God gave us His only begotten Son that we who believe into Him may not perish through His redemption in His humanity cherishing but may have eternal life in His divinity nourishing .
[63]  God gave His only begotten Son to redeem us in His humanity judicially so that we may have eternal life in His divinity for Him to save us organically.
[64]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TEN CHERISHING PEOPLE IN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS OUTLINE The humanity of Jesus is His human life in resurrection.
[65]  In the Gospel of John: When Christ as the God-Savior was recognized by Nathanael as the Son of God, He answered him that he would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on Him as the Son of Man, like the heavenly ladder seen by Jacob in his dream, as a kind of cherishing to encourage Nathanael to follow Him that he might participate in His nourishment with all the divine benefits as revealed in the entire Gospel of John 1:45-51.
[66]  When Christ as the God-Savior wanted to save an immoral woman of Samaria, He had to travel from Judea to Galilee through Samaria and detoured from the main way of Samaria to the city of Sychar, and He waited at the well of Jacob, near Sychar, for His object to come that He might cherish her by asking her to give Him something to drink so that He might nourish her with the water of life, which is the flowing Triune God Himself 4:1-14.
[67]  In this message we do not want to stress the Lord's cherishing us but our cherishing others.
[68]  The model of Jesus as the Son of Man cherishing people needs to be reproduced in us so that we also will cherish others in His humanity.
[69]  THE HUMANITY OF THE NEW MAN OF THE BELIEVERS IN GOD'S NEW CREATION IS ALSO IN RESURRECTION
[70]  Cherishing the Parents by Laying His Hands on Their Children
[71]  When His disciples rejected people bringing their children to Him, He stopped their preventing and asked them to bring the children to Him, and He cherished the parents by laying His hands on their children 19:13-15 .
[72]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE ELEVEN NOURISHING PEOPLE IN THE DIVINITY OF CHRIST OUTLINE The members of the vital groups have to learn how to nourish people to continue their cherishing of people.
[73]  To cherish people is to make them happy, pleasant, and comfortable; to nourish people is to feed them with the all-inclusive Christ in His full ministry in His three stages.
[74]  The model of Christ cherishing the churches and nourishing the churches in taking care of the churches Rev 1:12-13: He takes care of the churches as the lampstands in His humanity as "the Son of Man" to cherish them v. 13a: By dressing the lamps of the lampstand Exo 30:7.
[75]  In order to nourish people with Christ, we first have to seek Christ, experience Christ, gain Christ, enjoy Christ, and participate in Christ.
[76]  B. Taking Care of the Churches in His Divinity
[77]  Christ, as the High Priest, takes care of the churches as the lampstands in His divinity with His divine love, signified by the golden girdle on His breasts, to nourish the churches Rev 1:13b .
[78]  Expressing in His humanity the bountiful God in His rich attributes through His aromatic virtues: Expressing the bountiful God in His human living.
[79]  In the previous messages, we have seen how Christ cherishes us in His humanity and nourishes us in His divinity.
[80]  Christ accomplishes so much by His ministry, His service, from His incarnation to the consummation of the New Jerusalem.
[81]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE THIRTEEN NOURISHING PEOPLE WITH THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST IN HIS FULL MINISTRY IN THE THREE STAGES 2 OUTLINE The accomplishments of Christ in the stage of His inclusion from His resurrection to the degradation of the church: To be begotten as God's firstborn Son: From eternity past without beginning, Christ was God's only begotten Son: Possessing only divinity, without humanity.
[82]  In incarnation the only begotten Son of God became flesh to be a God-man, a man possessing both the divine nature and the human nature.
[83]  To regenerate the believers for His Body 1 Pet 1:3: The pneumatic Christ became the life-giving Spirit for the regenerating of the believers, making them the many sons of God born of God with Him in the one universally big delivery: For the composition of the house of God, even the household of God.
[84]  In the previous message we saw the accomplishments of Christ in the stage of His incarnation.
[85]  Now we want to see His accomplishments in the stage of His inclusion from His resurrection to the degradation of the church.
[86]  We need to be constituted with all the items of this revelation so that we can nourish people with the unsearchable riches of Christ in His full ministry in the three stages.
[87]  Christ, the Son of God as the second of the Divine Trinity, after completing His ministry on the earth, became was transfigured into the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection.
[88]  Through His death and resurrection, Christ released the divine life that was confined in the shell of His humanity and dispensed it into His believers, making them the many members which constitute His Body John 12:24 .
[89]  This life-giving Spirit who is the pneumatic Christ is also called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , and the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .
[90]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE FOURTEEN NOURISHING PEOPLE WITH THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST IN HIS FULL MINISTRY IN THE THREE STAGES 3 OUTLINE The accomplishments of Christ in the stage of His intensification from the degradation of the church to the consummation of the New Jerusalem: To intensify His organic salvation: For His ministry in the stage of His inclusion, Christ became the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, to carry out His organic salvation for the producing of the church and the building up of His Body to consummate the New Jerusalem.
[91]  On the way of Christ's ministry in the stage of His inclusion, the church became degraded to frustrate the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.
[92]  Hence, Christ as the one life-giving Spirit became the seven Spirits of God Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 3:1: Not seven individual Spirits.
[93]  V. THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF CHRIST IN THE STAGE OF HIS INTENSIFICATION
[94]  Recently we have seen that John 4:14b shows us that the goal of God's eternal economy is the New Jerusalem: "The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life."
[95]  Christ Calling the Defeated Believers to Be His Overcomers
[96]  In His seven epistles to the degraded churches, Christ calls the defeated believers to be His overcomers by Himself as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for their experience of His organic salvation in His sevenfold intensification.
[97]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE FIFTEEN HOW TO CONTACT PEOPLE 1 OUTLINE You should be one who is in the intimate and thorough fellowship with the Lord, without anything between the Lord and you.
[98]  Having a thorough confession all the time of failures, defects, wrongdoings, practices of the flesh and of your natural man, offenses to God and men, and sins.
[99]  You must be so familiar with all the outlines of the recent messages concerning the person of Christ and His accomplishments in the three stages of His full ministry that you can memorize them and use them spontaneously in your visiting and contacting of people.
[100]  I. BEING A PERSON IN THE INTIMATE AND THOROUGH FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD
[101]  THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE SIXTEEN HOW TO CONTACT PEOPLE 2
[102]  We have seen that in all of our contact with people, we must cherish them with the goal of nourishing them with the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[103]  Part of our upcoming winter training will be a crystallization-study of the Lord's organic salvation in Romans.
[104]  Romans 5:10 says, "For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled."
