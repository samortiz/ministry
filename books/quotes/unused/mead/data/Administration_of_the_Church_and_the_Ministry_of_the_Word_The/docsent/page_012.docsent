   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Requiring Others to Be the Same as We,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Respecting What Others Do</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not require others to be the same as we are in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not discuss the way others give messages, visit people, or live.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even if we are not pleased with the way others live, we cannot set standards for others, nor are we qualified to judge others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the Lord is the criterion and the Judge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to learn to respect what others do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we speak of being zealous, we should respect others quietness; when we speak of being calm and joined to the Lord, we should not criticize those who are busy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If everyone is the same as we are, there will not be the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There would be only one member.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If everyone is like us, there would be only we ourselves and not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is composed of many kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This can be compared to the human body having different members.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The hands look like hands, the feet look like feet, the ears look like ears, and the eyes look like eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even the member who seems to be the most uncomely is necessary in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, we should learn not to step on others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When it is our turn to work, we should not criticize what others have done.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is a blessing to respect the work of others and to add our work to theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should be positive when we speak with others, not negative.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is unwise to say that others are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as these negative factors exist among us, the administration of the church will have problems, and the ministry of the word will not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many saints from different places serve together in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They have different dispositions and family backgrounds, and they also have different spiritual backgrounds and training.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we cannot expect everyone to be like we are.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to learn not to step on others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we take a step, we should not step on others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should especially avoid stepping on others when we minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, when speaking about prayer, we should not criticize those who speak about meditation, because the saints may need both.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should simply speak positively about prayer without criticizing others speaking concerning meditation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we serve together, we must absolutely avoid criticizing others in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may speak about prayer and others about meditating; some may speak of being zealous and others of being in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are not heretical teachings; they are merely different in emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Criticizing others shows that we are narrow, and this will lead to division.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If this is the way we work, there will be no building among us; on the contrary, there will be destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should simply labor positively and learn to receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should realize that no one can do our part.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even the apostle Paul could not do what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, we also need to admit that we cannot replace others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every person has his own function.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we minister the word, fellowship, and pray, we should not criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In particular, when we pray with others, we should avoid praying in a contradictory manner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not Insisting on Our Own Way</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elders once felt that a certain meeting should study the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One of the responsible brothers in that meeting, however, felt that John was too long and wanted to study 1 Thessalonians instead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He felt this would help those who did not normally read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since he insisted, the elders eventually agreed with him even though his burden for 1 Thessalonians was not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This brother did not have a proper burden.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He simply thought that the saints would be afraid of a book with twenty-one chapters, and he allowed his opinion to trample the feeling of the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Unless this brother was truly burdened for 1 Thessalonians, he should not have presented it in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not do things that we have no burden for, and we should not abandon things for which we are burdened; we must serve according to burden.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To do otherwise violates a spiritual principle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This responsible brother had not learned the lesson in spiritual matters, and he was inexperienced in the way he conducted himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If our fellowship is a matter of spiritual burden, there should be no problem with proposing a change, and we should not criticize the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, if we simply want to change others ways, we should not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to respect the ways of the ones with whom we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even though the elders will not force a group to study a certain book or speak certain things, we should not casually change what they commit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Strictly speaking, it is all right to study either John or 1 Thessalonians; it does not matter which book is studied.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is possible to minister to the brothers and sisters through 1 Thessalonians and through the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In our service we should always avoid changing the ways of others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should realize that when we change others ways, they might not accept it, because they feel that it is inappropriate, and if they accept our change, there is not a sweet feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because of this kind of problem, our service in the administration of the church and the ministry of the word is not strong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even in the world, when people work together, it is not easy to change one another s ways.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we truly have a skill, it will be manifested if we work according to their way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we have spiritual content, we can minister to the saints through 1 Thessalonians and through the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No matter the book, we should be able to minister the spiritual content.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What we should fear is not having spiritual content to minister to people; however, if we have spiritual content, we will be able to minister and develop any book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, changing the way others do things indicates that we have not learned many spiritual lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It also indicates that we are inexperienced in the way we conduct ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some brothers lead the saints to serve fervently, hoping that they can spend more time to learn to fellowship with the Lord and to know the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not change their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should even praise them, saying that it is good to love the Lord and be fervent.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, our praise should not be insincere.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It should positively supplement their labor.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We always need to have an attitude of respect, cooperation, and coordination with others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should serve according to our portion and honor the portion of others, because both portions have been entrusted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Everyone should have the humility to not regard his portion higher than another person s. We should take care of others feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Unless they speak heresy and create problems for the work and the church, we should always respect them, be accommodating toward them, and receive help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>May the Lord grant us grace to see that this is a matter of life that involves being broken and being humble.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Those who can reach a goal without forcing others to take their way are truly humble.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As those who love the Lord, we desire to live for Him and build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>These goals are right, but there are many ways to reach these goals.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>For example, preaching the gospel with a brother is a good goal that can be done according to his way or according to our way.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We receive the blessing when we do not force others to do things our way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we have spiritual content, we can minister his way, and if he has spiritual content, he can minister our way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Both ways are acceptable; it is not necessary to adhere to a certain way.</S>
