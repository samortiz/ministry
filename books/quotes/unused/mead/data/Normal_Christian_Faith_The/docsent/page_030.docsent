   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PASSED THROUGH THEIR MIDST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me mention another story about Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One day He came to the synagogue in His hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Someone handed Him the Scripture, and He started to read from a passage about Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The people there, however, despised Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He remarked that a prophet is always despised in His own place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, God would not choose them but would rather go to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After they heard this, they were very indignant.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They carried Him outside and tried to throw Him down a cliff.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I like very much what Jesus did then.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He passed through their midst Luke 4:16-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If someone tried to push us over a cliff, we would struggle to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But He was no ordinary person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He simply passed through the persecutors' midst.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They could do nothing except let Him pass by!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Again, you see the same Jesus preaching to a ruler at midnight in a house John 3:2 , while choosing to converse with a woman beside a well at midday 4:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything He did was very proper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No one can say anything against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You cannot find fault in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>NEVER DOING A WRONG THING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Another time some opposers came to tempt Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They asked whether or not it was lawful to pay tax to Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jewish nation, as you know, no longer existed then, and Caesar of Rome was their king.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Jesus said "no" to the question, He would have been involved in a political issue, and the opposers would have had an excuse to condemn Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If He said "yes," all the Jews would have counted Him as siding with the Romans and hated Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The result, of course, would have favored the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was a question that could not be answered "yes" or "no."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How did Jesus reply?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said, "Show Me the coin for the tribute" Matt 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He even had the opposing ones draw out the money from their own pockets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He asked, "Whose is this image and inscription?" v. 20 . They had to admit that it was Caesar's. Jesus gave an excellent reply: "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God" v. 21 . With that He dismissed the whole case.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is where His majesty lies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He never made a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot get a case out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>CALMNESS AND MAJESTY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I cannot enumerate all His deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything He did bears such a mark of nobility that there is absolutely no flaw in His behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I will briefly mention His betrayal as a final example.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was very late in the night, and men armed with torches, spears, and swords came to arrest this empty-handed Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He asked them, "Whom do you seek?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They said, "Jesus the Nazarene" John 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He replied, "I told you that I am" v. 8 . At that very word, the band of rogues whose minds were set on capturing Him fell back to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If Jesus had not voluntarily given Himself over to them, they would never have been able to seize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such calmness and majesty can only be seen in Him!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As to the traitor, Jesus knew from the first day of his intention.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet He allowed the same to follow Him and even let him be the keeper of the money.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the time Jesus knew that money was being stolen by him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who can demonstrate such forbearance and uprightness?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here is a man who is absolutely different from all others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In every respect, He has been proven to be the Son of God.</S>
