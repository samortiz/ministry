It has now been sixty-four years since the early part of this century when the Lord raised up His recovery in the Far East. During this time the Lord has shown us many divine revelations. Especially in the last twenty-three years, since the Lord brought His recovery to the West, we have published the greatest number of books among us, even double the number we had published in the first forty-one years. All together about three thousand messages have been put out. The content of these messages is nothing other than the revelation of the Bible concerning the Triune God in His Divine Trinity-Father, Son, and Spirit-working Himself into all the believers of Christ. This is the main subject of the Bible, but for the most part it is not taught in Christianity; instead, Christianity has ignored it, even missed it.<p>God&#8217;s economy is that the Triune God in His Divine Trinity-Father, Son, and Spirit-is working Himself into those who have believed into Christ that they may be regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and even completely conformed, within and without, to the image not of the only begotten Son but of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). The only begotten Son of God had only divinity without humanity. He was only God but not man. The firstborn Son of God, however, has both divinity and humanity. He is not only the complete God but also the perfect Man. This is a marvelous matter. In His divine economy the Triune God intends to work Himself into us, beginning with our regeneration and continuing with our sanctification, transformation, and conformation until we have been conformed to the same image as Christ, the firstborn Son of God, in both divinity and humanity (2 Cor. 3:18; 1 John 3:2).<p>In this way Christ becomes the firstborn Son of God, and we become the many sons of God. In the universe God has obtained a group of sons out of His old creation through His work of the new creation. These sons are the many brothers of His firstborn Son and the many members of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5). These many members and Christ constitute the one new man (Eph. 2:15). God has His many sons, and Christ has His many members. These many sons of God constitute His house for His kingdom, and these many members of Christ constitute His Body as the corporate expression of the Triune God, the totality and the ultimate consummation and manifestation of which is the New Jerusalem. The church today is the miniature of the New Jerusalem.<p>Over the past twenty-three years we have put out messages concerning God&#8217;s economy again and again. Regrettably, Christianity, for the most part, neither knows nor inquires about this economy of God. In other words, nearly all of Christianity has become a religion which at most preaches to sinners in a shallow way about the name of Jesus and His gospel in the Bible and helps them to be saved by repenting and believing in the Lord Jesus. Most people do not even know that to be regenerated is to receive the life of God as their life apart from and in addition to man&#8217;s own life. In their view, regeneration is similar to what the Chinese call &#8220;putting away the old and turning over a new leaf,&#8221; that is, everything of yesterday is over and dead, while everything of today has a fresh beginning.<p>Thus, nearly all of Christianity has no understanding of and is entirely lacking in such matters as God&#8217;s economy, Christ as the mystery of God, the church as the mystery of Christ, and Christ and the church as the great mystery. In 1 Timothy 3:9 Paul tells the saints who are deacons that they must hold &#8220;the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.&#8221; In verse 15 he goes on to say that the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. Today if we were to ask Christianity&#8217;s professors of theology, pastors, or famous evangelists what &#8220;the mystery of the faith&#8221; is or what &#8220;truth&#8221; is, most of them would answer that a mystery is a mystery, so man certainly cannot understand it. Concerning truth, they would say that it simply means &#8220;doctrine.&#8221;<p>Actually, the truth in 1 Timothy 3:15 refers to the reality of the universe. First, the reality of the universe is the Triune God. Originally, everything in the universe was entirely vanity because all things would pass away. Nothing is real or reliable; neither the heavens nor the earth is reliable. The only reality in the universe is the Triune God Himself. This Triune God has a heart&#8217;s desire which is to work Himself into His chosen people by passing through some processes. This is why the Lord Jesus came and announced that He is the reality (John 14:6). This means that as the embodiment of the Triune God, He is the reality of the universe. Later, the Holy Spirit came as the Spirit of reality, the Spirit of truth, not to teach people the biblical truths but to be the reality of the Triune God, dispensing Him into people as reality.<p>Furthermore, the word of God is also reality because the word of God brings God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit into us. For this reason, the Lord said that His words are spirit and life (6:63). Today when we contact the Bible, we are contacting neither a book of theology nor a book of doctrines. Rather, we are receiving the God and Christ of reality; that is, we are receiving spirit and life imparted to us through the holy Word.<p>The church is the pillar and base of this reality. The church upholds neither doctrines nor theology but reality. Once there was a student at a Christian seminary who testified that in the first year of his theological studies the students believed that God existed, in the second year they doubted His existence, in the third year they began to deny Him, and by the fourth year they utterly denied Him and did not believe that He was real. Another student of theology told me that attending seminary was terrible and that in the end the students were just left with an &#8220;ism&#8221; or an &#8220;ology.&#8221; They studied &#8220;tritheism&#8221; and &#8220;Christology,&#8221; but in the end they had neither God nor Christ, just an &#8220;ism&#8221; and an &#8220;ology.&#8221;<p>I thoroughly understand Christianity, having contacted it for so many years in both the East and the West. I can even say that I have thoroughly studied Western Christianity. I have seen it all clearly. The majority of those in Christianity do not have the proper concept of the truth, and they have completely ignored God&#8217;s economy. When I went to the West with my full preaching of God&#8217;s truth, some immediately responded with more than twenty publications slandering me for preaching the Eastern philosophy of pantheism. I have contacted some among them who have much theological knowledge. Although they know that the Bible speaks about God&#8217;s economy, they have not entered into that economy. On the contrary, they have remained stuck in their familiar theology. What Christianity has given the world today are things such as the Christmas tree and Easter eggs. I once met a pious Christian in America who was unable to give up his Christmas tree because his wife and children liked it. This is the impression given by Christianity.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Furtherance of the New Way for the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
