   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEADERSHIP DEPENDING ON SPIRITUAL CAPACITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In God s New Testament economy the leadership among His children is not official, permanent, or organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, leadership depends upon spiritual capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The one with the greatest capacity is the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At one time that capacity may be with a certain brother, but at another time it may be with a different brother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the day of Pentecost the greatest capacity was with Peter, but in Acts 15 it was with James.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The relationship between Barnabas and Paul further illustrates this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Acts 13:2 says, As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see that Barnabas is named before Paul Saul .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But when they were on their mission, Paul spontaneously took the lead Acts 13:9 because he had the greater spiritual capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was Barnabas who brought Paul to Antioch, and as long as they were in Antioch, he took the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Barnabas did not argue with Paul when Paul took the lead on the mission.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Barnabas did not say, Paul, stand back.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Don t forget that my name was mentioned first when we were called.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why are you taking the lead?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because Barnabas realized that Paul s capacity was greater than his, he did not argue with him over taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these cases prove that the leadership among God s children today should not be official, permanent, or organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, it depends always upon spiritual capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God ordained it this way in order to set aside the human concept of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament the kings succeeded one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There were never three or four kings at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But in the New Testament the Lord appointed not one apostle but twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later, He added others, such as Paul, Barnabas, and Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that there were many apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If not, in 2 Corinthians 11:13 how could there be false apostles?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, in every local church there are always a number of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The plurality in the eldership indicates that actually there is no fixed leadership in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>PRACTICING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CONCERNING LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The reason I mention this matter now is that during the past few years someone presumed to be the leader of the Lord s recovery not only in this country, but throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the saints had been clear about the truth concerning leadership and had practiced the truth, no one would have accepted such a claim.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we are clear about the truth and practice the truth, from now on no one will dare say that he is the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To consider me the leader in the Lord s recovery is to not be clear about the real situation; it is against the practice of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During the years I have been with you, I have never assumed to be the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have not given orders either to the churches or to the saints concerning what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, many times elders of various churches have begged me to tell them what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I always told them to go to the Lord in prayer and let Him lead them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no organized leadership in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we left the denominations long ago, we mainly left the hierarchy, the organization.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all must hate hierarchy and never accept it in any form.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, during the past few years, a hierarchy began to creep in and assume leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because so many were in darkness and did not practice the truth, this was tolerated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we must all know the truth regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must be under the shining of the light and full of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose someone claims to be appointed the leader in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not take his word; instead, we should go to the one who is said to have appointed him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a janitor who works in the White House claims that the President has given him an order concerning you, do not take the janitor s word for it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, contact the President and ask him about it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You should not follow the janitor s order simply because he comes in the name of the President.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you take the janitor s word blindly, you cannot help but be deceived, for you are in darkness and are short of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You should never do anything or believe anything because the claim is made that a certain brother says so.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What matters is what the Lord says and what the Bible teaches, not what a brother says.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How we must learn the truth and practice the truth concerning this!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was with Brother Nee for years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We never considered him the official leader, and he never regarded himself in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever someone thought of Brother Nee as the leader and came to him for instructions, Brother Nee would never say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only when a person came to him for fellowship would he open himself to share something.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He never assumed that he was the official leader.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Likewise, I do not regard myself as the official leader in the Lord s recovery today.</S>
