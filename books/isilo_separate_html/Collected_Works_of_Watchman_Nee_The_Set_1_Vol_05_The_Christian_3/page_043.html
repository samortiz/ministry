Although they are "Philadelphia"-brotherly love-what they love is Christ. Their relationship with Christ is most personal. Because they love Christ in this way and because they love Him so personally, they are able to become "Philadelphia."</P><P>The reason for this is simple. Everyone who loves Christ will have his heart enlarged to receive and accept the whole church of Christ. When an individual joins himself to Christ, he is joined to everyone who joins himself to Him this way. Our first responsibility is to have an uninterrupted fellowship with the Head, and then through Him, to have fellowship with all the members. If we seek first to have fellowship with the members without having fellowship with the Head, we are upsetting the proper order.</P><P>Many unions that arise as a result of reconciliation or of relinquishing different opinions are unscriptural. The union of the believers in Christ is not a so-called "union," or an association of institutions. God has shown us only one way. All attempts to set up another way as the condition for union are destined to failure. "Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" (2 Tim. 2:22). This is the teaching of the Bible. When two walk on the same way, naturally they are joined together. On this way, there are at least the four characteristics mentioned here. We cannot neglect any one of them for the sake of reconciliation. This way is absolutely personal. Yet it can include all those "who call on the Lord out of a pure heart." The first characteristic is righteousness. It is most important to keep God's commandment and to have pure words and conduct. Without righteousness, we cannot talk of faith. A conscience living before the Lord and a heart trusting in the Lord is indispensable to the believers' living. Only by having this can we obey His will. Only then is it time for love to be manifested. Under this atmosphere, love cannot be lost. In the end, peace will prevail over different opinions and over confusion; only then can there possibly be peace. It is rather meaningless for believers to seek peace with each other without seeking for righteousness.</P><P>This is the God-ordained way for believers to be joined together. Here we see no conditions, bylaws, ordinances, or mutually recognized regulations. It is absolutely personal. Yet this is God's arrangement for believers to be joined together. One Lord alone determines the position of everyone. Everyone who accepts this position is joined one to another. Everyone is a member in the Body, and everyone accepts the rule of the Head. There is no ground left for us to decide if we want to unite or to have separate organizations. When we obey the Lord, we will spontaneously be united. At present, however, the rule of the majority annuls the individual. For the sake of peace or for reason of gain we tolerate things that we do not agree with. At the beginning the conscience may suffer, but in the end, it even becomes very forgiving. Because this condition is too prevalent, the voice of rebuke is almost drowned out. The issue of this is rejection of Christ's word and His name. The initial feeling toward sin is now lost. If a man strives for the oneness of the Holy Spirit without the acceptance of the cross, failure is the inevitable result.</P><P>However, here [vv. 7-8] the Lord's name seems to have a deeper significance than His name ordinarily has. Here the Lord Jesus shows three things to the church: that He is (1) the Holy One, (2) the true One, and (3) the One who has the key of David. He also praises them for three things. After reading this passage carefully, we have to conclude that what the Lord reveals about Himself has much to do with what He approves. The little power that this church has is related to the Lord's holiness. The keeping of His word is related to the Lord's truthfulness, and the not denying the Lord's name is related to His having the key of David. If this is the case, we see that the Lord's name mentioned here must be related to the Lord's title as the Son of David.</P><P>This speaks of the Lord Jesus as king on earth. As the Son of David, He will ascend the throne of His ancestor David and will reign on earth for a thousand years. He will completely overcome the power of the devil and will shut him up in the abyss. His kingdom will be physical, and His boundary will be the whole world. This is the glory of the millennium. When we mention the Lord's name, we refer to His being the earthly Son of Man, the Son of David, in the same way that He is the Son of God. The Lord's name includes not just His word. However, how many today recognize the Lord Jesus as the king of the world who will defeat Satan completely? How many believers have the hope of the millennium? It seems that the Lord knows this situation ahead of time; He knows that there will be some in the church among the saints who will forget the glory of His kingship. This is why He purposely reveals His own title as the Son of David to be a test to the faithfulness of His children. Although every Christian recognizes the Lord Jesus as the Son of David, there are not too many who know the real significance of this name and who believe that He will reign on earth. This is also the point concerning Christianity that the earthly kings are particularly bothered with, if they know about this point at all. This is the good testimony that the Lord Jesus made before Pontius Pilate.</P><P>This shows us what great temptation the world will face in the future. Man will set up another king besides Christ. The most severe persecution will come upon the believers because they will refuse to accept another king besides Christ. In another place in this book, we have seen how man will set up another name besides Christ for worship-a kingly name, the name of the beast (Rev. 13:17). A faithful servant of the Lord can never accept any name, whether it be religious or political in nature, besides the name of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
