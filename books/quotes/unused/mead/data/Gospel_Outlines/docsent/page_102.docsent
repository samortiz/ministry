   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord went to Samaria, which was a low vile, base and thirsty place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The important point seen about Samaria is the well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This shows us that the problem with the lower class is thirst.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This lower class woman was confronted by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their confrontation was because of the Lord s waiting; it was not an accident or a coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why did the Savior, Jesus, go to this well and wait for the Samaritan woman?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Savior needs the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The sinner needs the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Savior went to the well because of His thirst, as did the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The place where they met was the well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The subject of their conversation was the water, the cure for their thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The position of the lower class as seen in the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She is one who has no morality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one has any respect for this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She has had five husbands and now is living with another man who is not her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She is the scum of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She is probably not educated.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She is probably not too old.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She does not fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The higher class person, Nicodemus, went to find the Lord at night, while the lower class person came to the Lord in the daytime, at noon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The higher class person talked about proper behavior while the lower class person talked about the quenching of her thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The realization of her need and knowledge of the Savior Jesus asked the woman for some water to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He did this to make her aware of her own need that she might then realize the Savior, Jesus, and His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord first asked for water, she only knew that He was Jewish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She was offended that He, a Jew, asked for water from a Samaritan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then Jesus said, If you knew the gift of God, and Who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Jesus spoke this, He wanted her to realize her need and then also to see who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The woman said, Sir, give me this water...</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus told her first to call her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With this, she realized that He was a prophet, and finally that He was the Messiah, the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord caused her to realize how to know the Savior and how to quench her thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How to meet the need The Lord caused her to know her sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When she saw her need for the living water and also realized that Jesus was the giver of this water, only then did she ask for the water.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then Jesus asked her concerning her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Husband represented the history of her sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She talked to the Lord Jesus about worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord showed her that to really touch God one needs to be in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The outcome of their conversation she received the living water When the Samaritan woman got the living water, she immediately left her waterpot and departed from the well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From that time on, she never could depend upon her own way to satisfy her thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because of her past life, the fact that she had become fully satisfied was now a wonderful testimony to Jesus Christ.</S>
