   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to John 15:26, the Spirit of reality whom the Son sent from and with the Father testifies concerning the Son as the vine; hence, the Spirit testifies to the branches and through the branches to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 15:26-27 the Lord Jesus said, But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me; and you testify also, because from the beginning you have been with Me.

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once again we see the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father in the Son s name.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Spirit comes from the source, He does not leave the source but comes with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This Spirit, sent by the Son coming with the Father, will testify concerning the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, His testimony concerning the Son is a matter of the Triune God.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Religion may persecute, but the Spirit of reality testifies that the Son is the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through the believers as the branches this testimony will go forth throughout the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Father is the source of the vine, the Son is the vine, and the Spirit is the life-juice of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This great vine is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All that the Father is, is in this organism, embodied in the vine, which is the second of the Trinity.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the Spirit who carries the riches of the Father to sustain the vine and its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This vine into which we have been grafted is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ the Son is the vine, and we are the branches to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father, that is, the expression, spreading, and multiplication of the Father as its source and husbandman.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The full expression depends upon the branches, the Body, for what God is in Christ the Son and as the Spirit will be expressed by the branches, the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All that God the Father is and has is in Christ the Son, all that the Son is and has is realized as the Spirit, and all that the Spirit has is in the Body, in the church, in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In other words, God the Father as the source is embodied in God the Son as the center who is now realized as God the Spirit as the reality.</S>
