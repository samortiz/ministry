<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO MANAGE AFFAIRS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 13, 1948<br />Place:Kuling</h1><p>In order to be a worker of the Lord, the first thing we have to learn is to manage affairs in a proper way. Those who cannot manage affairs can never work for the Lord. Everyone who is good at the Lord's work is also good at managing affairs. Beginners in the Lord's work should learn in particular how to manage affairs properly. We will mention seven things in connection with the management of affairs.</p><h2 class="head1">NEVER CONSIDERING BUSINESS AFFAIRS<br />TO BE SOMETHING UNSPIRITUAL</h2><p>Those who are involved in management of business must be clear first of all that this activity is by no means unspiritual. Even Peter and John were involved in the distribution of food at one time. Stephen, who was filled with the Holy Spirit, was also a server of tables. The proper management of affairs is a necessary lesson that a beginner in the Lord's work must learn. If a man cannot manage affairs properly, he cannot work effectively. A young person must not offer himself simply "in prayer and in the ministry of the word." In many cases this is an excuse for idleness under the name of "prayer and ministry of the word." We have to uproot this. A person who is learning to serve the Lord should learn to "serve tables." Otherwise, he will not be able to do anything except preach. A learner in the Lord's work must learn to handle business properly, or else he will give ground to disdain and contempt. We must never consider the management of affairs as something unspiritual. It is something that a servant of the Lord must learn.</p><h2 class="head1">THINKING THINGS OVER</h2><p>Second, before we touch any matter, we have to know that it is God who has placed us there, and that we have to put our heart to the task. Those who are lazy with their hands are useless, and those who are lazy with their brain are also useless. Some people never give enough consideration to what they are about to do. It is harder to ask them to think about what they are going to do than to ask them to give up their lives. Such ones never accomplish anything. We have to consider carefully everything that pertains to the church. This does not mean that we must have an opinion about everything, but it does mean that we must be mindful of everything. Those who have not considered but who are quick to give opinions are counselors; they are not believers. Expressing an opinion means making proposals and having an instant reaction to matters. Being mindful of matters means to consider the causes and consequences of everything in a thorough way. Unless we think things over carefully, we will encounter many problems. In managing affairs, the more we think things over, the less problems we will face. Anything that we have considered well beforehand is handled judiciously. We should not be hasty in our opinions concerning any matter. We should not react lightly or propose quickly. Instead, we have to sit down and think things over carefully. No one should do anything without first considering and planning. Before a man builds a house, he must first sit down and plan. We have to be careful and sober in dealing with matters, and we should strive to glorify God in managing these affairs. Those who are careless in handling business affairs will be careless in preaching and studying the Scripture as well. The first thing we should do when we face a situation is to think the whole thing over. Those who are lazy in thinking are lazy in everything. In order to learn to serve God, we can never be lazy in our thinking.</p><h2 class="head1">BUDGETING TIME, MONEY, AND PERSONNEL</h2><p>After we have thought over the whole matter, we have to make a plan and write this plan down. Thinking enables us to understand the problem at hand, and planning enables us to come up with a solution to deal with the problem. The first thing to plan is our time, next is money, and third is the manpower needed to do the work. Whenever a job comes to us, we have to budget the time, money, and number of people needed. For example, if a man wants to build a house, he has to calculate the time, money, and number of workers needed to finish the job. He must also factor in all the possible changes that may occur throughout the course of the project. This planning provides the necessary information for building his house.</p>
