   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The content of the training was very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Nee gave messages for six hours a day, five days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of the details are as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How to be a minister of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A minister of the Word is one who serves men with God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must know how to use your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be a minister of the Word, the basic requirement is that you learn how to use your spirit; otherwise, what you do will be from the soul, the emotion, and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You must touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A worker must touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He must not only submit to direct authority but also to deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only one who touches authority and learns to obey can be the authority and can minister God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must know people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must know whether the spiritual condition of the brothers and sisters is proper or abnormal before you can help them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To know people, you must not simply listen to their words, but learn to touch their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This requires that you yourself receive God's serious dealing and let God dig deep and touch you thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you have never been dealt with and if you are unclear and foolish, you can never know others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So you must live in God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Learn how to study God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Spend time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Especially the young people must spend time to study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You must be the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What kind of person you are determines what kind of Bible you read.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You should not be sloppy, subjective, hardened, or curious.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Learn how to deliver God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must not preach yourself, but the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With some, what comes out of their speaking is not God's Word, but man's thinking, concept, and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only must your spiritual condition be right, even your words must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, people will not touch God or receive light and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must have revelation and a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One who serves the Lord must receive revelation from God and discharge that burden.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only thus can you give people the real supply.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How to help new believers: The past must be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After a new believer has been saved, he still carries on his back all the things of his former life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He mixes the Lord's life with all his past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In evaluating himself, he is still righteous and proud; he still covets vainglory; he still has a peculiar temper and cannot get along with others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All these things must be done away, and he must become like a little child in order that he might begin to be a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christians have a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a standard for the Christian in his living, concept, and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he does not know this standard, it will be very easy for him to boast in himself, be satisfied with himself, and trust in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What he thinks is wrong may not be wrong, and what he thinks is right may not be right.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only those who know this standard know what things they should not do and what words they should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only those who know the standard are able to discover what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The kind of edification that new beginners need is that which helps them tear down what should be torn down and add what should be added.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only by this means can they be expected to become Christians with a Christian standard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Practice: Who is a new beginner?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After a sinner believes in the Lord and is baptized, he is a new beginner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Regardless of his age, education, position, or experience in the world, he needs to receive the new beginners' edification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who have believed in the Lord for years but have never been edified should also participate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way: By speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you speak, you should speak loudly and clearly, pick up the main points, and stay with the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not use a topic as a platform to speak what you want to speak; do not speak as though giving a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You should encourage the asking of questions 1 Cor 14:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, questions should be in line with the subject and should not go beyond.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Answer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The answer must be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the question is too far off, you must bring it back in line.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you answer, you must not try to save face by not paying attention to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you know, you must say that you know; if you do not know, you must say that you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Speak according to the order of the fifty subjects for the new beginners' edification.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Cover fifty subjects every year.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Get into the matter of the daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not just speak.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must check to see if they have carried out what you said.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You must keep on pushing and checking until the word has been implemented into their living and until it is clear that they really mean business.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Concerning those who take the lead: Have a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The position of those who take the lead must be that of messengers delivering God's Word, not of teachers coming to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They must be like low ones speaking to low ones, not like high ones teaching low ones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Touch the fresh spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The fifty subjects already mentioned will be repeated every year, so those who deliver the messages must touch the fresh spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If your spirit becomes old, what you say will be merely a doctrine, like repeating a prayer book.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Ask for the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A Christian's life depends upon the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you do not have the Lord's blessing, even though what you say is nicely arranged and in order, you still cannot work it out well.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not a matter of whether Christians walk on the right path; it is a matter of whether they walk on the path of the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Things to pay attention to and the solution to problems: Things to pay attention to: Take care of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Someone asked an elderly brother what was the most useful age of a man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After considering for a moment, he said, "The period between the ages of seventy and eighty."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Some were sent to the grave before they reached their most useful age.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When this happens, it is a loss to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You should not damage your own body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You should exercise self-control regarding your daily living, including your eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Exercise your character.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord's servant needs a good character.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A loose, lazy, or low character can damage and destroy one's work, even if he is gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Solution to problems.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Every day during the training there was a meeting in which the trainees took turns testifying and asking questions.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After each testimony Brother Nee would give a thorough judgment and correction according to each person's condition and need.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>On the one hand, he pointed out where the real problem was, and on the other hand, he laid out before each one the way of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>His words of judgment and direction were very much to the point, full of light, and sometimes stern and solemn.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When he was finished, those who were judged prayed, and most of them repented and confessed with tears and weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>How to administer the church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Brother Nee gave much fellowship on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What he said can be summarized in seven points: The offices in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The two offices are the deacons and the elders overseers .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>How to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Service should be the service of the whole Body and not a one-man show.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The church is the Body of Christ, and all the saved ones, as the members, must function.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There are two aspects to the church service: the priestly service on the spiritual side, and the Levitical service on the business side.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>How to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The church should have the following kinds of meetings: gospel meetings, new beginners' meetings, prayer meetings, the Lord's table meeting, the meeting referred to in 1 Corinthians 14, sisters' meetings, and children's meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The local church need not maintain a message meeting on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>And it should definitely not establish the system of pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>At any rate, the church should not follow after "the customs of the nations" denominations .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We must throw away the tradition and take the way of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The relationship between the local church, the work, and the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The highest authority of the local church is the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Elders are set up by apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The removal of elders is also up to the apostles; so the elders should listen to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The apostles are responsible for the work, and the elders are responsible for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But within the region of the work, the apostles can also be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When there is a problem between the churches, the apostles and elders should come together before the Lord to seek His mind, have fellowship, and resolve the matter, according to Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But at the same time we must not just practice the scriptural way; we must have the Spirit of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The matter of coordination among the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The workers must coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>To have coordination you must: Know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In God's work there is the master builder who takes the lead among the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>For this reason you must learn to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Seek fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Without fellowship there is no coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>In order to practice fellowship, the co-workers must learn to: Open up their hearts to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Forsake individualism and be in one accord as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Bear one another's burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Actively seek fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Only in the authority and in the fellowship can there be the real practice of arrangement, sending out, staying, and commitment.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Who is a co-worker and who is an apostle: Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The apostleship is not a gift but an office.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>From the gifted ones God chooses some who are vessels fit for His use and sends them to work and establish the church for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>For example, in Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas were prophets and teachers according to their gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>But once sent out by the Holy Spirit, they were called "apostles" in Acts 14:4.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>An apostle is not required either to have an occupation or to forsake it if he has one.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Paul's occupation was that of an apostle, not a tentmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>He simply worked as a tentmaker so that he could be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The scope of the co-workers is larger than that of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>All the brothers and sisters must make their occupations a secondary thing for the purpose of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>All of those who are for the Lord are our co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The matter of finances: Concerning the distribution of money in a local church, there are the following categories: Regular expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Care of the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Care of the need of the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>The need of other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The supply to individual workers.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>The supply to the entire region of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>The financial relationship among the co-workers: The one who takes the lead should supply the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>The co-workers should be supplied according to individual need, not according to gift.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>All must learn to live by faith, to trust in God instead of in some human source, and not to be responsible for anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>All must learn to receive by faith and to give by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
