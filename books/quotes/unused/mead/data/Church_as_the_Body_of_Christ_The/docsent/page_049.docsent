   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN TEARING DOWN PRODUCING FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE BODY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: How should a believer who has a harmonious marriage, obedient children, and an environment with no suffering or sickness pray if he wants to be broken?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: We Christians should accept God s breaking when it comes, but we should not ask for the breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who are in the Lord s hand are not likely to have satisfactory circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If one is satisfied with everything, he is probably an Esau, not a Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a brother s or sister s environment is very smooth, he or she should worship the Lord and be thankful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we should not trust that this smooth environment will last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nonetheless, we do not need to ask for a terrible environment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The thought of asking for a terrible environment often comes from the devil, not from God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should accept the environment measured to us by the Lord, but we should not ask for it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Similarly, we should accept His breaking but not ask for it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Question: Some brothers and sisters are frequently sick, suffer persecution and affliction in their environment, and experience difficulties in their families.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How should they respond?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Answer: Simply speaking, there are two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, they need to submit under the mighty hand of God; on the other hand, they should ask the Lord to take the sufferings away if they are not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not think that the Lord delights in making us suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are willing to submit under the Lord s hand, but we do not need any suffering that is not of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suffering does not necessarily equal being broken.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should seek the Lord when we are suffering and ask Him why this suffering has come upon us, or what particular point within us this suffering is touching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are clear concerning what needs to be dealt with within us, we will accept His dealing in that point.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This, however, is still a doctrinal explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In experience, many people are perplexed when they pass through affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they were clear, the affliction would not be very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most of the time, people do not realize the purpose of affliction until after the affliction; they are not clear while they are passing through affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is quite normal for them to be unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Question: Is someone who always condemns his thoughts, whether good or bad, accepting God s breaking?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Answer: This does not necessarily mean that he is accepting the breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a person condemns himself because he feels to do so before the Lord, he should do so.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, this does not mean that he is being broken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, it is easier for such a one to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Similarly, it is easier for a person who condemns himself, even though he does not have the feeling from the Lord to do so, to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A person who often condemns himself, rather than justifying himself, often does not need to be broken through outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A person needs to be broken through many outward environments because he does not condemn himself or because he overly justifies himself, overly depending on his skill and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A person who justifies himself and relies on his skill and ability forces God to use the environment to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a person always condemns himself and rejects his skill and ability, he will spare himself from many troubles and many dealings in the outward environment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Question: We know that in order to have good coordination, we need to be torn down and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if we have not been torn down or built up much, how can we have good coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Answer: Tearing down and building up are daily and regular, not instantaneous, matters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have not been torn down and built up in a regular way, we cannot expect to have been torn down and built up when it is time to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have not been torn down and built up, how can we have good coordination?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot force ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is coordination, there is; if there is not, there is not, even if we try to force ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Coordination is a spontaneous matter of life; we cannot force ourselves to coordinate, nor can we pretend to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The degree of our coordination is determined by the degree of our daily tearing down and building up, in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without the tearing down and building up, there is no real coordination, even if we force ourselves to work something out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In response to this, some have said, If we do not have the regular tearing down and building up, we should not try to coordinate with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, even this not trying to coordinate with one another is unnatural.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is man s work; therefore, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The extent to which we have been torn down and built up is the extent to which we can coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not purposely try to coordinate or purposely try to avoid coordination; rather, we should act according to what is spiritually spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Question: Does a person need to have a special calling or confirmation to work for the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Answer: This is a practical and also important question.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In principle, everyone who is led by the Lord to serve Him should be clear concerning his calling.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, we would need a considerable amount of time to explain how to be clear concerning the Lord s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the 1952 issue of The Ministry of the Word in Chinese, there is a message that specifically speaks of the matter of calling vol. 1, p.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>426 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That message is very thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Concerning this question, the brothers and sisters should look at that issue of The Ministry of the Word.</S>
