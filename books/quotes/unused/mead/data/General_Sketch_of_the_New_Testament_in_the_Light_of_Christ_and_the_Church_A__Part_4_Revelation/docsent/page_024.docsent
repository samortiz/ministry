   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE THE FIRSTFRUITS, THE HARVEST,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE WINEPRESS Scripture Reading: Rev 14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must remember that chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen of Revelation were written symbolically.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we should not understand them literally.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen this clearly in chapters twelve and thirteen; chapter fourteen is the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 14:1-5 says, And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And I heard a voice out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harp-singers playing on their harps.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been purchased from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And in their mouth no lie was found; they are without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Zion in verse 1 is not the Mount Zion on the earth but the one in the heavens Heb 12:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sound of harp-singers in verse 2 is for praising.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That the hundred and forty-four thousand are purchased from the earth indicates that they are redeemed ones, a part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The firstfruits here are before the throne of God; they are no longer on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that they have been raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are on Mount Zion in the heavens, before the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 14-16 of the same chapter mention the ripened harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The firstfruits and the general harvest are mentioned in type in Leviticus 23:10 and 22, Exodus 23:19, and 34:26.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The firstfruits are brought from the field not to the barn but into the temple for God s satisfaction and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The majority of the harvest, however, is left in the field until it ripens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After ripening, it is brought not to the temple but into the barn, the place between the field and the farmhouse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that the general harvest of the believers is not taken to the throne of God but to the air 1 Thes 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Revelation 12, the rapture of the man-child, who fights against God s enemy, is not merely a matter of prophecy, nor is the rapture for the sake of the believers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, it is for a function before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God needs the man-child to be raptured to the heavens to fight the battle with His enemy that the enemy might be defeated and cast down to the earth for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same principle, the firstfruits in chapter fourteen do not merely enjoy the rapture, but they satisfy God s need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, the man-child fulfills God s purpose by defeating His enemy, while on the other hand, the firstfruits are for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the firstfruits offered to God in the temple for His satisfaction, they enjoy the rapture in order to take care of God s need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not pay as much attention to the prophecies themselves as to our maturity, so that we may be the firstfruits to satisfy the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For us to give God this enjoyment, we need to be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are still green and childish, how can we be the firstfruits and be raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, the Lord will have to leave us in the field until we ripen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The firstfruits are the faithful followers of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They follow Jesus and are not defiled by the earthly things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are the part of the redeemed ones that mature first.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As such, they satisfy God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They will be raptured not merely to the air but will transcend the air to be taken to the temple of God, the throne of God, for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no need for more definitions or interpretations concerning the firstfruits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We only need to see the foregoing spiritual meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE ETERNAL GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Revelation 14:6 and 7 say, And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel to announce to those dwelling on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give Him glory because the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who has made heaven and earth and the sea and the springs of waters.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The four Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles speak of the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace; these books do not have such a term as the eternal gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not confuse these different terms.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The eternal gospel is neither the gospel of the kingdom nor the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, this gospel will not be preached by redeemed men but by an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace are preached by redeemed men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Angels have no right, no position, to preach the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Acts 10, an angel appeared to Cornelius to tell him to send for Peter to preach the gospel, but the angel could not preach the gospel directly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The eternal gospel, however, is different; it is preached by an angel.</S>
