   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN THE COURT OF THE TABERNACLE 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 27:9-19; 38:9-20; 40:33 I. SIGNIFYING THE SPHERE AND BOUNDARY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The outer court signifies the sphere and boundary of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The tabernacle not only typifies Christ Himself, but also typifies God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God s dwelling place is in four stages: Christ, the children of Israel, the church, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is God s dwelling place, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Old Testament Israel also was God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now in the New Testament the church is the building of God, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the millennium the New Jerusalem will be God s dwelling place for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The book entitled The Vision of God s Building shows that the entire Bible is a book of building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first two chapters of the Bible, Genesis 1 and 2, we have the materials for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Genesis 2 mentions gold, bdellium a kind of pearl , and onyx stones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, we have a building made of these three categories of material.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Between these two ends of the Bible there is the process of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For the fulfillment of His plan to have an eternal building, God first created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Creation was a work of preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s main work is the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we read the Bible, we may pay attention to God s creation, but not to God s work for His building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God s selection, predestination, calling, redemption, and salvation are all for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even regeneration is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever God is doing today in preaching the gospel, edifying the saints, or establishing churches is part of His building work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, these activities are part of God s main work, the work of building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has a goal, and this goal is to build a universal dwelling place for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the tabernacle in Exodus we have a type, a model, of this building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the tabernacle was rather small, ten cubits wide and thirty cubits long, it is unique in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It would be difficult to change anything related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No human being would make such a design.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out, the tabernacle was according to the pattern shown to Moses on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, the pattern of the tabernacle was a heavenly pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The tabernacle as God s building had a sphere and a boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This sphere and boundary were the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I prefer a house with a wall to mark the boundary of the property.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a dwelling has a boundary with a definite sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know from the book of Revelation that the New Jerusalem will have a wall one hundred forty-four cubits high.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that God s building has a boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God likes to have a wall to mark the boundary of His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>ITS SIZE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The length of the court of the tabernacle was one hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The number one hundred is composed of ten times ten.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This signifies completion of completion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This expression can be compared to the expressions King of kings or song of songs, indicating that it is the best, the highest, of completion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The width of the court was fifty cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fifty is composed of ten times five and signifies complete responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ten is the number of completion, and five is the number of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without the five fingers on our hand, it would be difficult to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On each hand we have four fingers plus one thumb.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The number four signifies human beings as God s creatures, and one signifies God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man plus God gives us the ability to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As believers, we are human beings with God added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our number is now the number five.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The area of the outer court formed a rectangle one hundred cubits in length and fifty cubits in width.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This rectangle was half of a square with sides of a hundred cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This half of a square signifies one half of a whole unit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It also indicates that another half is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, it implies a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The outer court was a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One half was present and the other half was yet to come.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The New Jerusalem will be a complete whole, a square and not a rectangle.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We, of course, are not yet in that age of fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We are still in the age of testimony, waiting for the coming of the other half.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are like one half of a married couple that needs the other half for completion.</S>
