   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PRACTICAL LIFE IN A LOCAL CHURCH 6 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 4:15; 3:6-12, 16; 6:17, 19; 7:40</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse the word joined refers to the believers organic union with the Lord through believing into Him John 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This union is a matter not only of the divine life but in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The organic union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The words one spirit indicate the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God John 3:6 , who is now in us 1 Cor 6:19 and who is one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and as such a Spirit He is now with our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the one spirit in 1 Corinthians 6:17 is the mingled spirit, our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>TWO SPIRITS The Human Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Every regenerated person has two spirits within him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, a regenerated person has a regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, dwelling within the regenerated human spirit there is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the years we have placed strong emphasis on the importance of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have pointed out again and again that man has a spirit within him created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning the human spirit, Zechariah 12:1 says, The Lord...stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This verse indicates the importance of the human spirit, for here the spirit of man is ranked with the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the sight of God three aspects of His first creation are especially important: the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we have said a number of times, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with his spirit is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is by the spirit that man is able to contact God, receive God, and contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As those who believe in Christ, not only do we have the human spirit created by God, but our human spirit has been regenerated, born of the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus speaks clearly concerning this fact: That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this verse the Spirit is the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is born of the Spirit is the human spirit, the regenerated spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regeneration takes place in the human spirit by the Holy Spirit of God with God s life, the uncreated eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Compound Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every regenerated person has the divine Spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the New Testament this Spirit has different titles: the Spirit of God Rom 8:9 , the Holy Spirit Luke 1:35 , the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>, the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These titles of the Spirit are used interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Elsewhere in the New Testament the divine Spirit is called the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , and even the seven Spirits Rev 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to describe this Spirit, especially as the Spirit is typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30, we have coined the expression the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The New Testament reveals that in Jesus Christ God was incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The incarnation brought God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through incarnation God actually became a man, and then lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of this period of time, the Lord Jesus, the God-man, was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through His death on the cross He terminated all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God needed Christ to terminate all negative things through His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After dying on the cross, the Lord rested for three days, and then He was resurrected from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In and through His resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This Spirit includes the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, we may speak of this Spirit as the compound Spirit.</S>
