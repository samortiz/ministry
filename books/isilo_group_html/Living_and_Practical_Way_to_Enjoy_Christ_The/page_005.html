Now we have to know what God is. As the content to us, the containers, He is the Spirit. It is only as the Spirit that there is the possibility for Him to come into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST REVEALED IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</H2><P>The Gospel of John shows that the Lord Jesus is the very God who is the Spirit. It starts in this way: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (1:1). Then John 4:24 says, "God is Spirit." In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and God is Spirit. Who is God? We have to say that Jesus is God. John 4:24 is a continuation of verse 14 of the same chapter. In verse 14 Jesus told the Samaritan woman that He is the living water. The living water is Jesus, who is God Himself as the Spirit. Jesus, the living water, God, and the Spirit are four titles referring to one entity. Jesus is the living water, the living water is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is God Himself, and God becomes Jesus in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Son Being the Father</H2><P>Some heretically say that Christ is merely a man and not God. There is a group of people in a so-called church in the Philippines who do not believe that Jesus is God. Some would even say that Jesus is just the Son of God, that He is neither the Father nor the Spirit. They teach this way because they want to systematize the Bible. But we cannot systematize the Bible. Isaiah 9:6 tells us that a child is born whose name is called the mighty God, and a son is given whose name is called the eternal Father. This shows that Jesus is both the Son and the Father. If we could understand this thoroughly and explain it to the uttermost, He would no longer be wonderful. Isaiah 9:6 says that His name shall be called "Wonderful." Because He is Wonderful, we cannot fully explain Him. If you asked me, "Brother Lee, is Jesus the Son or the Father?" I would say He is Wonderful. His first title is Wonderful. Is He the child or the mighty God? I would say, "Wonderful."</P><P>A little child is the mighty God. Is this not wonderful? Those in Judaism do not believe that the little child born in the manger at Bethlehem is the mighty God. But Isaiah 9:6 tells us this. We cannot explain this because He is Wonderful. If you can explain it to me, then He is no longer Wonderful. Hallelujah, He is Wonderful!</P><P>In John 14 Jesus spoke with His disciples in a wonderful way. He said, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him." Then Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us." The Lord responded, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father" (vv. 7-9). The Lord Jesus is Wonderful! He is not only the Son but also the Father. He is not only the Son and the Father, but also the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). Christ is all. He is the child; He is the mighty God. He is a human being; He is also the Divine Being. People try to systematize the Divine Trinity, but it is impossible to do this. Our Lord Jesus is all in all! He is Wonderful! He is God, man, the Son, the Father, and the Spirit.</P><P>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that they had already seen the Father because He had been with them and they had seen Him for three and a half years. This meant that they had seen the Father. The Lord went on to say, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works" (v. 10). While the Lord was speaking, the Father was working.</P><P>Philip's asking the Lord to show him the Father was like someone saying to me, "Brother Lee, please show us Witness Lee." I would say, "Don't you believe that Brother Lee is in Witness Lee and Witness Lee is in Brother Lee? If you have seen Brother Lee, surely you have seen Witness Lee. Now Brother Lee speaks, but Witness Lee does the work." Jesus is really Wonderful. He is both the Son and the Father. Do not think that outside of Him, there is the Father. The Father is in Him. As you have seen Him, you have seen the Father.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Practical Way to Enjoy Christ &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
