Besides J. N. Darby and J. G. Bellett, God granted special ministries to many of the brothers so that His church could be supplied. George M\u00fcller, who established an orphanage, recovered the matter of praying in faith. In his lifetime he had over 1,500,000 answers to prayer. C. H. Mackintosh, who wrote Notes on the Pentateuch, recovered the knowledge of types. D. L. Moody said that if all the books in the entire world were to be burnt, he would be satisfied to have just one copy of the Bible and a set of C. H. Mackintosh\u2019s Notes on the Pentateuch. James G. Deck gave us many good hymns. George Cutting recovered the assurance of salvation. His booklet \u201cSafety, Certainty, and Enjoyment\u201d sold thirty million copies by 1930. Other than the Bible it was the most widely sold writing. William Kelly wrote many expositions; he was described by C. H. Spurgeon as one whose mind was as big as the universe. F. W. Grant was the most learned of the Bible in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Robert [69] Anderson was the man who best knew the book of Daniel in the recent age. Charles Stanley was the one who best brought people to salvation by preaching the righteousness of God. S. P. Tregelles was the famous New Testament philologist. The book on church history by Andrew Miller was the most scriptural among the many church histories. R. C. Chapman was a man greatly used by the Lord. These were the brothers at that time. If we were to recount in detail others among the brothers, the number of all who were greatly used by the Lord would exceed at least a thousand.

The Brethren started from this point and released the light of the truth. Other truths were discovered by the Brethren, including the truths concerning the second coming of the Lord Jesus and the church. Biblical truths flowed out from them like torrents, and we are still being helped by them. Many famous Bible teachers in church history were brothers in their midst, such as J. N. Darby, J. G. Bellett, C. H. Mackintosh (who wrote Notes on the Pentateuch), and William Kelly. These brothers knew the Bible and opened up the Bible book [199] by book. At their time the Bible was completely opened up. This fulfilled what the Lord said to the church in Philadelphia: \u201cYou have a little power and have kept My word\u201d (Rev. 3:8). When the Brethren were raised up, they kept the Lord\u2019s word. This is the reason that the light of the Lord\u2019s word was especially shining among them. To this day there is still much light among the Brethren.

More than ninety percent of the fundamental teachings in Christianity come from the discoveries made by the Brethren teachers. The Scofield Reference Bible is very popular in the United States today, but C. I. Scofield was just the \u201csalesman,\u201d not the \u201cfactory,\u201d of his teachings. The truths in almost all the notes in his reference Bible and the teachings in his correspondence course came from Brethren writings. C. H. Mackintosh was one of many great teachers among the Brethren. D. L. Moody, a great American evangelist in the last century, once said that if someone were to burn all the books in the entire world, he would be satisfied to have just one copy of the Bible and a set of Mackintosh\u2019s Notes on the Pentateuch. To Moody, all Christian writings except these meant little. Besides Mackintosh, there were many other great teachers among the Brethren, including J. G. Bellett and William Kelly. C. H. Spurgeon once described William Kelly as one whose mind was as big as the universe. To read the books by the Brethren is a great help.

Perhaps one of the best books concerning Christ is The Son of God by John G. Bellett. Although this book shows precious aspects of Christ, it does not come up to [135] the biblical revelation concerning Him, because it fails to unveil that Christ is for the church.

They saw that many things in the church were dead, lifeless, and formal. They began to ask the Lord to show them the church according to the biblical revelation. Through prayer and fellowship, they felt that they should rise up and meet according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14. As a result, they began to break bread at a brother\u2019s home. A short while later, a former Anglican minister, John Nelson Darby, began to join their meeting and to expound the Bible among them. Gradually, more and more expositors were raised up among them, such as William Kelly, C. H. Mackintosh, B. W. Newton, and J. G. Bellett. Through reading their books, I received light to see the error of denominational organizations and to realize that there is only one Body of Christ. The church should not be formed by human opinions but should be under the direct leading of the Holy Spirit. When we consider the present-day church organizations, we see many human traditions and opinions and little direct leading of the Holy Spirit. This is not according to God\u2019s desire. In God\u2019s will, the church should not be under man\u2019s control; it should be directed only by the Holy Spirit. All those who belong to the Lord should learn to [851] be led by the Holy Spirit and should not follow man\u2019s direction. These are all truths discovered by the Brethren.
