   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18; Acts 13:52; 6:3, 5; 7:55; 11:24; Matt 25:1-4, 8-9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that the mingling of God with man is a matter of the Spirit because the Triune God has been consummated as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen that the work of the Spirit has two aspects the inward aspect and the outward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, two different prepositions are used in relation to the work of the Spirit in and upon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we read the Scriptures carefully, we will notice that the Gospel of John mostly uses the preposition in, as in 14:17, which says, The Spirit of reality...shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in the two books written by Luke, the preposition most often used in relation to the Spirit is upon, as in Luke 1:35, which says, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and Acts 1:8, which says, You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, on one hand, the Spirit of God is working in us, and on the other hand, the Spirit is working upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE SPIRIT AS THE SUPPLY FOR OUR GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AND THE POWER FOR OUR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible often uses physical items to portray the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The two items that John uses to portray the Spirit are drinking water and breath John 7:38-39; 20:22 , which are vital for life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to live in the physical realm, we must breathe and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Similarly, in order to be normal Christians, we must breathe and drink the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The two items that Luke uses to portray the Spirit are clothing and wind Luke 24:49; Acts 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Clothing is something that we put on outwardly for authority such as a uniform , and the blowing of the wind is also something outward for power, unlike breath, which is inward for life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These four items water and breath, which are for life, and clothing and wind, which are for power show us that we must pay attention to two matters life and service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must grow in the life of the Lord, and we must serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consequently, we have two kinds of needs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be supplied that we may grow and mature in life, and we also need to be equipped so that we may serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit meets both of these needs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, the Spirit is within us as the life supply, and on the other hand, the Spirit is upon us to empower and equip us to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 25 there are two parables that pertain to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One is the parable of the ten virgins vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>1-13 , and the other is the parable of the talents vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>14-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The parable of the virgins is on the side of life, and the parable of the talents is on the side of service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As virgins we must grow and mature in the divine life, and as servants of the Lord who have each been given a talent, we must use our talent in the best and fullest way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The growth in life and the use of our talent in our service depend very much on the two aspects of the Holy Spirit s work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Gospel of John deals with the matter of life, while the books written by Luke deal with the power needed in our service.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Gospel of Luke shows us that the Lord Jesus as the Savior preached and ministered to the people of the world by the power of the Spirit Luke 4:14, 18; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Similarly, the only way we can preach and minister the Lord to the worldly people so that people will receive Him is by the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are clothed with the Spirit, we will be able to preach the gospel to the entire world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, at the end of the Gospel of Luke the disciples were told to wait until they were clothed with power from on high 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the book of Acts, also written by Luke, the power from on high came down upon the disciples, and they were filled and empowered with the Spirit to preach the gospel in a powerful way 2:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many times the brothers and sisters wonder why it is so difficult to have good meetings or to pray to the Lord in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason is simply that many have not yet experienced the baptism of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we all experience the baptism of the Spirit, we will be released, and we will be equipped and empowered to carry out our service.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I knew one brother who had such an experience in 1937.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before 1937 this brother had been saved and would pray privately in his own home, but he could not pray in the meetings or even sing the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then in 1937 Brother Watchman Nee came, and a number of brothers and sisters, including this brother, had the experience of being baptized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Immediately after that experience, this brother came to a meeting and offered a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That prayer released the spirits of nearly all the saints that day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was released, and others were released.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From that day on, he opened his mouth to sing and to testify in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we experience the baptism in the Spirit, we will be able to pray freely, to release our spirit, and to release others spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, and through our regeneration the Holy Spirit came into us and is now dwelling in us John 3:6; Rom 8:9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the Word clearly indicates that after our regeneration we must be filled with the Spirit in every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Acts the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit 13:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Joy goes together with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we are always unhappy, this indicates that we are lacking the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if we go to the Lord in the morning and get freshly filled with the Holy Spirit, we will be full of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Acts 6:3 and 5 say, Look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need...And the word pleased all the multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, 11:24 says that Barnabas was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These verses show us that faith and wisdom also go together with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we will be full of joy, wisdom, and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Matthew 25:1-4 and 8-9 say, At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And five of them were foolish and five were prudent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps...And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This parable is a warning to the foolish ones, the ones who are not filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this parable each virgin had a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the ancient days people did not have electric lamps; they had only oil lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order for an oil lamp to be lit, there must be oil in the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, in addition to the lamp there is a vessel that holds extra oil so that when the light begins to go out, extra oil is prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thus, there are two portions of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One portion is in the lamp, and the other portion is in the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All of the virgins in this parable had their lamps lit; in this regard they were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The difference among them was in regard to the oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Five prepared oil in their vessels, and five did not.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>These five thought that as long as their lamps were lit, they were all right.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must realize that each one of us has a lamp and that this lamp is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Proverbs 20:27 says, The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since we have been regenerated, we have the oil of the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, we still must pay the price to prepare ourselves with additional oil in our vessel, which is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In other words, although we have the Spirit in our spirit, we must be filled with the Spirit in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To be filled with the Spirit is simply to grow and mature in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have been regenerated, but have we grown and matured?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we are going to grow and become mature, we must be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In order to be filled with the Spirit, we must first be emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Suppose we have a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we want to fill this cup with tea, we must first empty out everything else that is in the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Likewise, we must check whether or not our being has been emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Holy Spirit is in our spirit, but He must occupy our soul our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is why the Bible uses the phrases the mind of the Spirit Rom 8:27 and the spirit of your mind Eph 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The mind of the Spirit is a mind under the control and direction of the Spirit, and the spirit of the mind refers to a mind that is so full of the mingled spirit that the spirit has become the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In order to have the mind of the Spirit, we must first deny our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To deny the natural mind is simply to empty ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We may be full of our own thoughts, the thoughts of the natural mind, so we must empty ourselves by denying the natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then the Spirit will take control of our mind and will occupy and fill our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As a result, our mind will be full of the Spirit, our mind will be the mind of the Spirit, and our spirit will be the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The same thing must happen with our emotion and will so that every part of our being can be occupied and filled by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Then the Spirit will be our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Remember that the Spirit is the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Thus, when the Holy Spirit occupies us, Christ occupies us, and when we are full of the Holy Spirit, we are full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When we are completely filled with the Spirit, we will be one with the Spirit and one with the Lord not only in our spirit but also in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The Spirit of the Lord will saturate and be mingled with us in every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We will be mature and transformed in the divine life, and Christ will be formed in us Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This matter of being filled with the Spirit cannot be accomplished merely by reading or listening to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We may read or listen to messages day after day for years, yet we may not be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>There is only one way to be filled with the Holy Spirit: we must go to the Lord and contact Him by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In other words, we must pray to the Lord 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The more we pray the better, because the more we pray, the more we exercise our spirit, and the more we learn how to give up ourselves and deny our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>You may say, I know that this is a matter of the cross ; however, it is not the knowledge of the cross that causes us to be filled but our contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>By this kind of contact we will be able to give up ourselves and be filled with the Spirit.</S>
