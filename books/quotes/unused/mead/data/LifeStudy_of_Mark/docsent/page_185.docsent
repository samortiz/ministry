   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 13 Scripture Reading: Mark 1:14-18; 4:26; 9:1-8; 10:23-25; Rom 14:17 THE BACKGROUND AND LOCATION OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE LORD S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is helpful in our reading of the Gospel of Mark to have an understanding of the situation when the Lord Jesus was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man s culture had been in existence for over four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One aspect of this culture was the religion of the Jews, a strong, typical religion formed according to God s holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, the devout Jews were very much attached to this religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With this as the background, the Lord Jesus came forth in His ministry to sow Himself as a seed into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, the Lord Jesus lived and ministered in the center of the world s population.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both geographically and culturally, the Jewish nation was the center of the inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was to that center that the Lord Jesus came to sow Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have you ever realized that the Lord Jesus came to the center of the inhabited earth to sow Himself as a seed into God s chosen people?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not know of any Christian writings that speak of the Lord s sowing Himself into people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you would ask Christians what the Lord Jesus came to do, some would probably reply that He came to save sinners, or that He came to die for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Of course, the New Testament says that Jesus Christ came to save sinners 1 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in the Gospel of Mark we see that the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel of God 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The phrase the gospel of God does not simply mean that the gospel is of God in the sense of belonging to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The main thought is that the gospel is something of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament, expressions such as the life of God, the love of God, and the righteousness of God mean that life, love, and righteousness are actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same principle, the expression the gospel of God indicates that the gospel is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, to preach the gospel of God actually means to preach God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel preached by the Lord Jesus was the gospel of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The kingdom of God is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then what is the gospel of the kingdom of God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may answer this question by saying that the gospel is the kingdom, and the kingdom is God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The gospel, the kingdom, and God are not separate; on the contrary, these three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is of vital importance for us to see that the gospel, the kingdom, and God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The gospel is God, and God is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, the gospel is the kingdom, and the kingdom is God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, according to the New Testament, the gospel of the kingdom of God actually refers to the very God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we have God as the kingdom, and the kingdom as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What should we be preaching today?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should preach God as the kingdom, and the kingdom of God as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not think that besides the kingdom of God or in addition to the kingdom of God, there is something called the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No, the gospel is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Neither should we think that besides God there is something called the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No, the kingdom is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, the Lord Jesus came to preach the gospel of God, which is the gospel of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now we must go on to consider how the Lord Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom of God.</S>
