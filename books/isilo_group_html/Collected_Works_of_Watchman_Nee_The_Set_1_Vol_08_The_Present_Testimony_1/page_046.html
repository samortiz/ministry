God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him." Man did not say this.</P><P>The thought stressed in the Bible is what God has said. When we desire sinners to be saved, we usually think only in terms of the benefit to the sinners themselves. We think if they do not repent, they will perish and suffer, and if they believe in the Lord Jesus, they will receive eternal life. But in Genesis 2:18-23, God's thought is on Christ, not on man. When sinners are saved, they are given by God to Christ-"the men whom You gave Me out of the world" (John 17:6). God has not only given Christ to men, but has also given men to Christ. God has presented a special gift to Christ, which is the sinners. God's intention in doing this is to satisfy Christ's heart.</P><P>The one great purpose for the believers to live on earth is to live for Christ. Adam was not created for Eve, but Eve was created for Adam. In the same way, believers are made for Christ. For this reason, we should satisfy Christ.</P><P>There are two stories of marriages in the Bible. They show, on the one hand, the direct relationship between Christ and the church, and on the other hand, the indirect relationship of God giving the church to Christ. The two stories are Abraham seeking Rebekah for Isaac, and Jacob marrying Rachel through suffering under Laban. Isaac did not know Rebekah; his father, Abraham, arranged the marriage. As to Rachel, however, Jacob himself suffered for the marriage. If Rebekah was not good, Isaac could have complained to his father, since Rebekah was selected by his father. Of course, we know that the one whom Abraham chose for his son was a true satisfaction to his son. God has chosen the church for Christ, and God must make the church a satisfaction to Christ. Rachel was dispositionally not that pure, and she was jealous. But Jacob did not murmur because he loved Rachel and was willing to suffer much for Rachel's sake. Christ is to the church as Jacob was in his marriage to Rachel, while God is to the church as Abraham was to Rebekah in the marriage of his son. The church is given to Christ through the hand of God. Our attention now is on the aspect of the church as Rebekah, who was given to Christ by His Father.</P><P>In God's view, Christ seems to be incomplete without us, as though it was not good for Christ to live alone, and as though He would still be lacking if He did not have the sinners. God's purpose in saving us is not just for us but also for Christ. God wants Christ to be satisfied, pleased, and completed. Therefore, He gives us to Christ. Let us see that we are called not just for our own blessings, but also to satisfy Christ's heart. Our responsibility is not to fail God. To whatever extent we satisfy Christ is the same extent God has not failed Christ.</P><P>There are two passages in the Bible which speak of "satisfaction." One says that in the coming days, Christ will see "the travail of His soul..and will be satisfied" (Isa. 53:11). The other says that "when [the believers] awake [in resurrection], [they] will be satisfied with Your [Christ's] likeness" (Psa. 17:15b). May we be able to satisfy Him.</P><P>We ought to save the sinners, for he who has life should beget more life and should beget the same kind of life that he has. The reason that God created man and saved him is that He is life and that He begets the same kind of life as He is. However, we must never forget that this is all for Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 08: The Present Testimony (1) &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
