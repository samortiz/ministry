<h2 class=head2>56. Helper</h2><p>Hebrews 13:5 says that our way of life should be without love of money and that we should be satisfied with our circumstances, for the Lord upholds us and will by no means forsake us. “So that, being of good courage we say, the Lord is my Helper” (v. 6). We should be satisfied with whatever we have and with whatever circumstances we are in, knowing that we have the Lord and that we can trust in Him for our living. Because we have Christ as our Helper, we should be content and at peace. The Lord knows our need. Therefore, we may have the assurance to sacrifice everything for Him and for the church life without worrying about our living. The Lord will take care of our needs. He is our Helper and He never forsakes us. Our life is in Him, and our living is in His hands.<h2 class=head2>57. Overseer</h2><p>In 1 Peter 2:25 we see that Christ is the Overseer of our souls. As believers, we have Christ as an Overseer, as an Elder. The New Testament reveals that an overseer is an elder and that an elder is an overseer. The Greek word for overseer means one who oversees a particular condition or situation. This word seems to indicate someone above us who takes oversight concerning us and watches what we are doing. However, the Lord as the Overseer is the One who cares for us. For Him to oversee us means that He takes care of us. As the Overseer, the Lord does not govern us or rule over us. Instead, He cares for us as a mother cares for her child. A mother oversees her child with the purpose of caring for the child, wanting to take care of every need. The same is true of Christ as our Overseer.<p>According to 1 Peter 2:25 Christ is the Overseer of our souls. Our soul is our inner being, our real person. Christ as the Overseer of our souls cares for the welfare of our inner being and exercises His oversight over the condition of our real person.
