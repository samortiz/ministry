   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Created by Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 2:15 reveals that the church as the new man was created by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ created the one new man with God's nature wrought into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This action was something new.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the old creation God did not work His nature into any of His creatures, not even into man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the creation of the one new man, however, God's nature has been wrought into man to make His nature one entity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The new creation, like the old creation, is not something individual but something corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the old creation God did not create millions of men; on the contrary, He created one man, Adam, who includes all men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The principle is the same with God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the new creation we are all parts of the new man, the church, composed of the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is a basic difference between the new creation and the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the old creation came into being through the work of the mighty God, He Himself does not reside in it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the first creation has no divine content.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The divine nature does not dwell in the old creation, and that is why it has become old.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Adam did not have the life of God or the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can receive the divine life and the divine nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and being regenerated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we believed in Christ, God's life and nature were imparted to us and made us a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, "If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is of God through our faith in Christ 1 Cor 1:30; Gal 3:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The words, "Behold, they have become new," are a call to watch the marvelous change of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "they" refers to the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature; however, the new creation, composed of the believers born again of God, does have the divine life and nature John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The new creation is actually the old creation transformed by the divine life, by the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The old creation was old because God was not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God are still God's creation, but we are now His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, this is real only when we live and walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever we live and walk by the flesh, we are in the old creation, not in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would be in the new creation, we must enter into an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Apart from such a union we shall remain in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But now, by the organic union with the Triune God, we are in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As believers in Christ, we are the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Adam we were born into the old creation, but in Christ we were regenerated into the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here in the new creation we are not only God's assembly, God's house, and God's kingdom and not only Christ's Body and counterpart we are also the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's intention is to have a corporate, universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God wants such a man for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, we were created in God's old creation and became the old man; on the other hand, we have been re-created in God's new creation and have become the new man.</S>
