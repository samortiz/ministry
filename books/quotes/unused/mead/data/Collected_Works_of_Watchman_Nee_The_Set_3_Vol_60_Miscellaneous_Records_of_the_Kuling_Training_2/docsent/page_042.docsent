   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE A FEW THINGS THAT A WORKER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD SHOULD REMEMBER Date: July 23, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Kuling HIS VOICE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The main thing a worker of the Lord has to do is to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason he has to pay much attention to his voice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some people have a good voice by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Others are just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The voice we have by birth is not the main factor; the main thing we need is training.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are two basic things to remember about our voice during our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, we have to relax our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, we should try not to shout with the throat very much, but instead we should try to push our words out from the deeper part of our abdomen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ordinarily, when we relax our tongue, we cannot raise our voice at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Under such circumstances, it becomes hard to speak effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to relax the tongue, we have to relax the muscles of our entire body as well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before we speak, we have to remind ourselves that we should relax all our muscles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our tongue should be properly situated in between the teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can only relax our tongue if our whole body is relaxed, and only then can we speak properly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Next, when we speak, our body has to act like an accordion; we have to press the air out from our abdomen, not just speak from the throat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our abdominal muscles ache after we speak, we are doing the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if we find that our throat hurts after we speak, we are doing the wrong thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we speak, we should rinse our throat with disinfectant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This will prevent inflammation in the throat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>OUTWARD ATTIRE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A worker of the Lord has to pay attention to his outward attire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He should not dishonor his status as a worker of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He should neither be too fashionable nor too shabby in his attire, but he should pay much attention to cleanliness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our dress should not speak of anything beyond our status.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also must pay attention to our manners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are invited to a meal, try to make as little noise as possible at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before we travel to any place, we should wash and groom ourselves properly, presenting ourselves to others with a good appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The most important thing to remember is to avoid putting on anything that will strike others' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A worker of the Lord should strike others only with his words; everything else should remain plain, common, and unnoticeable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a worker does not take care of this, others will be attracted to the striking things and will ignore his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anything special will attract attention and distract others from the content of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first thing we should do when we go to a place is to dress the same way as the local people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Never be special in any way; always be as plain as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, when working in the villages, do not dress too formally or be too clean.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, we should not purposely wear dirty clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should always be sensitive to others' feelings when we are among them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our outward attire should not be too different from theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>CONCERNING MANNER</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A worker of the Lord must be polite.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not be loose among familiar brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a worker of the Lord, our walk must be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to behave civilly among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Never be uncouth in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the way we walk should be proper; we should not be rash in doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to learn to be inconspicuous and to be common and plain in our walk and move.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul was right when he was known to be weak in bodily presence 2 Cor 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Learn not to be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should sanctify ourselves among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others can laugh at some matters, but we cannot laugh at them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Others can say some things, but we cannot say the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to learn the proper lessons in our daily walk and habit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should let others feel our sobriety and weightiness.</S>
