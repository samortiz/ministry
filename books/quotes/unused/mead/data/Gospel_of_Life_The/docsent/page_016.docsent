   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER 15 2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Divine Dispensing 15:1 16:4</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it that it may bear more fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3 You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>4 Abide in Me and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. 5 I am the vine; you are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>6 If one does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>7 If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>8 In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and so you will become My disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>9 As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>10 If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>11 These things I have spoken to you that My joy may be in you and that your joy may be made full.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>12 This is My commandment, that you love one another even as I have loved you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>13 No one has greater love than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>14 You are My friends if you do what I command you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>15 No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all the things which I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>16 You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>17 These things I command you that you may love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>18 If the world hates you, know that it has hated Me before you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>19 If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>20 Remember the word which I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they have persecuted Me, they will persecute you also; if they have kept My word, they will keep yours also.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>21 But all these things they will do to you because of My name, because they do not know Him who sent Me. 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>23 He who hates Me hates My Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>24 If I did not do among them the works which no one else has done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>25 But it is so that the word written in their law may be fulfilled, "They hated Me without cause."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>26 But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me; 27 And you testify also, because from the beginning you have been with Me.</S>
