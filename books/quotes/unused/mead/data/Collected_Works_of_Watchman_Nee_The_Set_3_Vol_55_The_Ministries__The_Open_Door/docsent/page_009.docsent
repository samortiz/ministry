   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A DILEMMA Letter One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I went to my office the day after arriving in Nanking and handed in my letter of resignation on Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because I did not want my superiors to misunderstand, I asked a friend to explain for me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was surprised when my superior's secretary returned my letter of resignation the same day that I handed it in. Today is Monday, and I went in to personally ask to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My superior refused to accept my resignation again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I asked him to find a replacement for me as a department head as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I told him that I could wait for a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He agreed to consider it for a few days and said that I was not old enough to retire, nor was I physically disqualified for work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have been very frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It appears that I will have to insist on my retirement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My desire is to leave my job, and I have quit twice in four days.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am in a dilemma; I cannot resolve it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I hope you could give me some direction as to how to plan the next step.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Lee Shi-chun also studied chemistry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He used to make soap and now wants to start his own business.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every time there is a meeting I must travel more than twenty miles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is really difficult and time consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we had one billion, we could be partners in a small soap factory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We would sell our products in the brothers' stores or market stalls.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Chang Yu-lan</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>April 26, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Mailing Address: 30 Tse Tang Alley, Chung Shan East Road, Nanking</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Letter Two</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I wrote a second letter of resignation and received the following answer: "Please be constrained to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wait until I return from America to discuss this."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My supervisor will go to America for three months on the nineteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I think it will be hard to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I plan to wait for three months before doing anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When are you coming to Nanking?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church here has no way to care for the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot nourish the children we beget.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We plan to have a baptism meeting on the twenty-first.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not good at nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hope you will come to make some arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Chang Yu-lan</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May 10, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE SIGNS OF KNOWING ONESELF</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When my mother returned during summer vacation last year and passed through Shanghai, you asked how I was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You asked because I had sent you a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have been bothered about this because I should have sent a letter long ago telling you of my current situation, lest you worry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I confess that much of the time I am in the valley of the shadow of death with darkness on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems that I am in a hopeless situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no human hope left, and God is hidden from me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Despite this, I have passed through all these circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They only prove the words: "My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If I recounted God's leading over the past few years, I am afraid that you would not have the patience to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I can only briefly give an outline.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In general, all that I have passed through has caused me to know myself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have also gradually learned that apart from dying to all things, man cannot gain God Himself; he can only gain gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether in the church, in my family, or in my personal life, God is constantly dealing with me so that I do not have any desire apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I know that if a man can really deny himself, he will enter true rest and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A man does not have peace, rest, or happiness because he loves himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not know if I am right in saying this or not.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank you for your concern.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am very well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have many difficulties, but I believe God can resolve them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Respectfully,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>XX</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>March 31, 1948</S>
