[1]  CONTENTS A General Outline of God's Economy The Consummated Spirit The Reality of the Body of Christ The Proper Living of a Christ-pursuing God-man The Body of Christ and the Church The Lord's Move in His Recovery
[2]  Prayer: Lord, pour down Your Holy Spirit generously that we all may be filled with the Spirit outwardly and meet in the Spirit; may we have not only the Word but also the Spirit.
[3]  In order to carry out His economy, at a certain time God Himself became a man.
[4]  After the regeneration of these believers, there is the need for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry in ascension through His resurrection.
[5]  In His resurrection He brought His humanity into divinity to become the firstborn Son of God and regenerated God's chosen people to become the sons of God.
[6]  Hence, the processed Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ, and this Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God, has become the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God.
[7]  CHAPTER TWO THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gen 1:2; Judg.
[8]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You that You are God, You are the speaking God, and You are the revealing God.
[9]  THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT BEING INSEPARABLE FROM GOD'S ECONOMY
[10]  After He passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, the Lord Jesus sanctified and uplifted His humanity into divinity.
[11]  After the revelation of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit the Spirit comes to apply.
[12]  From the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah in the Old Testament to the Holy Spirit at the beginning of the New Testament, God was merely God, and there was no humanity in divinity.
[13]  Exodus 30 is a record concerning the building of the tabernacle, but in verses 22-30 God suddenly charged Moses to make the holy anointing oil.
[14]  When this Spirit comes into us, God comes in, Christ as a person comes in, His death with its effectiveness comes in, and His resurrection with its power comes in. This is an all-inclusive dose that consists of the supply of God, the supply of Christ, the problem-solving and killing effect of Christ's death, and Christ's resurrection with its power.
[15]  In creation You are the Spirit of God; in God's relationship with man You are the Spirit of Jehovah; in God's incarnation You are the Holy Spirit; for the bringing forth of the church, You, as the Holy Spirit, became the life-giving, consummated Spirit; and for the needs of the church, You, as the life-giving Spirit, became the sevenfold intensified Spirit.
[16]  CHAPTER THREE THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 1 Cor 12:12; Col 3:10-11; Rev 21:1; 2 Pet 3:10-12; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20-21; Eph 2:5; Rom 1:3-4; John 1:18; Rom 8:3; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15; Phil 3:10 AN ADDITIONAL WORD TO THE PREVIOUS MESSAGE ON THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT
[17]  The previous message on the consummated Spirit may be summarized as follows: God is triune; He became a man and passed through death and resurrection; in resurrection the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit has a consummation, and this consummation is the life-giving Spirit.
[18]  This life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processes through which the Triune God passed; in this consummated Spirit the church was brought forth.
[19]  Then the church became degraded, and the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God became the seven Spirits, the sevenfold intensified Spirit.
[20]  THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING PRODUCED THROUGH DEATH AND RESURRECTION
[21]  In the Body of Christ, the Head is uniquely Christ, and the Body is produced by the God-chosen people passing through Christ's death and resurrection.
[22]  Hence, we can either say that the Body of Christ is Christ, or we can say that the Body of Christ is all the members of the Body of Christ.
[23]  Romans 1:3-4 says, "Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh, who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[24]  THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST THE GOD-MAN LIVING
[25]  God's salvation is to put us into the death of Christ and then to bring us out of that death.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR THE PROPER LIVING OF A CHRIST-PURSUING GOD-MAN Scripture Reading: Phil 3:10; 1:19-21; 4:13; Rom 8:4; Phil 4:12 OUTLINE Pursuing to know Christ Phil 3:10a.
[27]  Pursuing to live a life of dying with Christ to be conformed to His death by the power of His resurrection Phil 3:10c.
[28]  Now let us see the proper living of a God-man who pursues Christ.
[29]  He wrote to the church in Philippi, referring to his life of living Christ to magnify Him, of pursuing Christ to gain Him, and of taking Christ as the secret of his contentment.
[30]  In such an Epistle with experiencing Christ as its subject, we can find out that the first thing in the proper living of a Christ-pursuing God-man is to pursue to know Christ.
[31]  The Lord Jesus told us, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me" Matt 16:24 .
[32]  The proper life of a Christ-pursuing God-man is also a life of living Christ to magnify Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[33]  We must not only know the power of Christ's resurrection and be conformed to His death daily, but we must also know the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[34]  God's desire is that we become Him through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ so that we can die to ourselves and Christ can live out of us and be magnified through us.
[35]  As the new creation, we should not live in the old creation.
[36]  We may live and walk in a proper manner, but if we do not live out the reality of Christ, we are not in the Spirit or in the reality of resurrection; hence, we are without the reality of the Body of Christ.
[37]  CHAPTER FIVE THE BODY OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Rom 12:4-5; 1 Cor 12:12-27; Eph 1:22-23; 4:4; Col 1:18; 2:19; 3:15; 1 Tim 3:15-16
[38]  They were once dead in their offenses and sins 2:1-3 , but now, as members of the Body of Christ, they are no longer strangers but members of the household of God v. 19 , being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God in spirit v. 22 . Then 4:4 speaks of one Body and one Spirit the Spirit ; it goes on to speak of one Lord and one Father, who is over all, through all, and in all vv.
[39]  Colossians is on the all-inclusive Christ having the first place in all things.
[40]  In chapter one he shows us that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation, in whom all things were created; that He is the Head of the Body, the church; and that He is the Firstborn from the dead so that He might have the first place in all things vv.
[41]  Then in chapter two Paul goes on further to show us that the Body of Christ needs to grow, and this growing is from the Head, Christ, because all the supply comes out from Him v. 19 . Growing is a matter of life, which is God Himself.
[42]  Hence, the growth of the Body of Christ has nothing to do with the doctrinal knowledge of the Bible, the way of worship, or any such matters; rather, it depends on the growth of God, the increase of God's element, in the Body.
[43]  THE REALITY OF THE HOUSE OF GOD BEING THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[44]  In the Bible the most thorough and the highest speaking concerning the house of God is in 1 Timothy 3:15-16, which says, "But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
[45]  CHAPTER SIX THE LORD'S MOVE IN HIS RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Eph 4:1-16; 2:11-22; 1 Tim 3:15-16
[46]  Prayer: Lord, we thank You for being with us and blessing us in the past five meetings.
