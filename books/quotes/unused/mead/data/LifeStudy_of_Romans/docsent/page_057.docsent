   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Three Lives with Three Laws</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are complicated people, for we have four laws related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Above us is the law of God with its demands.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our mind is the law of good responding to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our body is the law of sin which wars against the law of good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All of this is recorded in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But Romans 8 tells us that in our spirit is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence we have four laws: one outside demanding, one in the mind responding, one in the body warring, and one in our spirit supplying, empowering, and overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why are we so complicated?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are complicated because we have passed through three stations the creation, the fall, and God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were created, we were fallen, and we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is our history, our biography.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our biography is simply that we were created, that we fell, and that we were saved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In God s creation we received a human life, the life that makes us a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the fall another life was injected into us, the evil life of Satan which came into our body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After we were saved, the processed God as the Spirit of life came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, three persons are in us: ourselves in our souls, Satan in our body, and the processed God as the Spirit of life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have three parts to our being, and each part has a person: in our body, sin, that is, Satan dwells; in our soul, our self dwells; and in our spirit, the processed God as the Spirit of life dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each of these persons has a life with a law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan has his satanic life with its evil law, the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our natural man has a created life with a good law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The processed God as the life-giving Spirit has the divine life with the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we have an evil law, a good law, and the law of the Spirit of life, in brief, the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This law of life is opposed to both good and bad; it has nothing to do with good and bad, for both good and bad belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil Gen 2:9, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The law of life certainly belongs to the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Within us we have the tree of knowledge and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, each one of us is a miniature garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man is here, Satan as the tree of knowledge is here, and God as the tree of life is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These three parties that once were in the garden of Eden are now all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The battle that was raging between Satan and God in the garden of Eden now rages within us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This battle involves three persons, three lives, and three laws.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>E. God in Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As I have pointed out on other occasions, God is revealed progressively in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Romans 1 He is God in creation, in Romans 3 God in redemption, in Romans 4 God in justification, in Romans 5 God in reconciliation, and in Romans 6 He is God in identification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can see the process or the progress of God from creation to redemption, from redemption to justification, from justification to reconciliation, and from reconciliation to identification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has advanced from creation to identification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His creation God was outside of His creatures; in identification He has made us one with Himself by putting us into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As many of us as have been baptized have been baptized into Christ Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has put us into Christ, thoroughly identifying us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Romans 8 God becomes the God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is not only the God in identification, but the God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has not only made us one with Him, but He has also made Himself one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now our God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What kind of God is He?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the processed God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The God in creation has passed through redemption, justification, reconciliation, identification, and He is now in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The God in our spirit is not merely God; He has been processed into the Spirit of life, for the Spirit of life is the processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to our experience, nothing is more pleasant than this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may feast upon such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>F. The Enjoyment of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>as the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To come to a dining table to enjoy God as food is not my concept.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the gospels the Lord Jesus said that the gospel was a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord Jesus said that all things are ready and that we should come to the feast Luke 14:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He told us to come and dine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We even find this thought in the parable of the prodigal son Luke 15:11-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the son returned home, the father put the best robe on him, a robe signifying Christ as our righteousness for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the son returned, he was like a poor beggar standing before a rich father.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There seemed to be no correspondence between them: the father was rich and the son was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus the father told the servants to take the best robe and to put it on the son.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After this robe had been put on him, the son was justified before the father and corresponded to him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now the son is like the father, justified and approved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ as righteousness covers the returned son.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although this satisfied the father the son might have said, Father, I do not care as much about the robe as I care about my empty stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Father, I am hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You are satisfied, but I am not.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This was why the father told the servants to prepare the fatted calf, process it, and put it on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The father said, Let us all eat and be merry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Who is that fatted calf?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The calf is Christ who was processed on the cross over nineteen hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After He was processed on the cross, He became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Where is Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Where did He go after He was processed after His death and resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Undoubtedly, He went into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, if He were only in the heavens, it would be impossible for people to eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The heavens are too far away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But Christ is not only in the heavens 8:34 , but also in us 8:9 , even in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The dining table is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After being processed Christ became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The processed Christ is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He has come into our spirit as life and as the life supply for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is not my concept.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Although Christ is life, it is difficult for Christ to give you life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Who gives life?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is the Spirit that gives life John 6:63; 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Christ is life, but it is the Spirit who gives us Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Without the Spirit Christ may be life, but Christ as life cannot be given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>By being the Spirit Christ is imparted into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Today, after being processed, the very Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Now in our spirit we may enjoy this wonderful Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Never forget that Christ is the very God, Jehovah the Savior, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This Christ, after being processed, is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have to enjoy Him in His fullness as such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Our regenerated spirit is the dining table, and the processed Christ is our food.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He is not food in a physical form, but in the form of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Our food is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What a rich Spirit this is!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Divinity, humanity, love, light, life, power, righteousness, holiness, grace everything we need is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Romans 8 certainly is this dining table.</S>
