<h1 class="title">LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHETS SEEKING NOT THE LETTER<br />
BUT THE LORD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>The first stanza of <em>Hymns,</em> #806 reads, &ldquo;Break Thou the Bread of Life, / Dear Lord, to me, / As Thou didst break the loaves / Beside the sea; / Beyond the sacred page / I seek Thee, Lord; / My spirit pants for Thee, / O Living Word.&rdquo; This hymn may have been written by the Brethren because it contains types and figures. For instance, stanza 1 says, &ldquo;Break Thou the Bread of Life, / Dear Lord, to me; / As Thou didst break the loaves / Beside the sea.&rdquo; Stanza 4 says, &ldquo;Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, / To me, to me, / As Thou didst bless the bread / By Galilee.&rdquo; This kind of imagery is similar to what can be found in Brethren hymns. This hymn contains a crucial point that shows the kind of person we should be and the kind of attitude and desire we should have, if we desire to seek the word of the Lord.</p>
<p>This hymn also shows that the writer was not seeking mere biblical doctrine but the Lord Himself. Hence, the second half of stanza 1 reads, &ldquo;Beyond the sacred page / I seek Thee, Lord; / My spirit pants for Thee, / O Living Word.&rdquo; Then the second half of stanza 3 says, &ldquo;Show me the truth concealed / Within Thy Word, / And in Thy Book revealed / I see the Lord.&rdquo; The author of this hymn was not seeking doctrines but the Lord Himself in the Word.</p>
<p>Stanza 4 reads, &ldquo;Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, / To me, to me, / As Thou didst bless the bread / By Galilee; / Then shall all bondage cease, / All fetters fall, / And I shall find my peace, / My All in all.&rdquo; Everyone who seeks to prophesy, who seeks the Lord&rsquo;s word, should learn of the spirit and attitude demonstrated in this hymn. We need to see that we are not seeking the truth as doctrine or as letter. Instead, we are seeking the Lord of reality, the Lord Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING IN OUR DAILY LIVING<br />
TO HAVE RICHES TO OFFER IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We may all be familiar with 1 Corinthians 14:26, yet this verse is difficult to apprehend. Paul says, &ldquo;What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Here, <em>psalm</em> does not refer to a hymn like those in our hymnal but to a long poem. According to history, the apostles came out of the background of Judaism and were able to quote long poems from Psalms. Thus, the Greek word for <em>psalm</em> refers to a long poem from Psalms. This verse also says that each one &ldquo;has a teaching, has a revelation.&rdquo; A teaching pertains to a teacher, and a revelation pertains to a prophet. Verse 26 goes on to say, &ldquo;Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Building up can also be rendered as &ldquo;edifying.&rdquo; This means that our speaking should edify the saints individually and the church corporately; it should edify the individual members as well as the whole Body.</p>
<p><em>Has</em> is a crucial word in this verse. Brother Watchman Nee rightly explains this word. He says that <em>has</em> means that we do not wait until we come to the meeting to have something but that we prepare something before we come to the meeting. Over twenty years ago, when we were speaking messages on this topic, we saw the type in the Old Testament (Deut. 16:16-17). When the children of Israel went to the feasts in Jerusalem, God charged them not to go empty-handed. Everyone who went to the feasts had to bring with him the rich produce of the good land, whether it was oxen, sheep, pigeons, barley, grains, or fruit. A person could not come empty-handed (v. 16). Going to the feasts without empty hands is equivalent to <em>has</em> in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Every Israelite was required to have something to offer to God, whether an ox, a sheep, pigeons, barley, grain, or fruit. This indicates that our speaking in the meetings should not be an instant speaking but should come from the riches that we have prepared beforehand.</p>
<p>The type in Deuteronomy 16 clearly reveals that before coming to the meetings, we should all prepare something, just as the children of Israel did not go to the feasts empty-handed but brought with them the produce of the good land. Moreover, they were required to prepare the produce properly, bring it to Mount Zion, and offer it in the outer court of the temple. This is clearly spoken of in the Old Testament. Every time we come to a meeting, we must prepare beforehand, praying to the Lord to see which portion of the Word can be offered before God for the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s people; this is how we should prepare.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we noticed that the word <em>has</em> appears five times in 1 Corinthians 14:26. <em>Has</em> does not refer to something miraculous, such as a sign or wonder. <em>Has</em> implies that something is obtained through labor and preparation. In the Old Testament the children of Israel obtained the rich produce of the good land by labor. The produce did not grow by itself simply because God sent the rain. Although a large part of the produce was the result of God&rsquo;s work, if the children of Israel did not plow the ground, cultivate the land, rear the oxen, sheep, and pigeons, and plant the fruit trees, where would the produce come from? Hence, although it is absolutely true that God blessed them, that God sent the rain, and that God caused the land to grow fruit, all of God&rsquo;s activities required the cooperation of human labor.</p>
<p>Our speaking in the meetings should come from what we have obtained from God through our daily labor. If we labor on the good land by cultivating the land, trimming the orchard, and rearing the oxen, sheep, and pigeons, we will have a rich harvest. However, if we are slothful, not much fruit and grain and not many oxen and sheep will be produced. As a result, we will go to the feasts empty-handed. Later, the children of Israel offended God, and there was a barrier between them and God; thus, their labor became futile because no matter how hard they labored, God did not send the rain. Without rain, the land could not yield anything. God even sent the wind not only to dry up their fruit but also to dry out the soil.</p>
<p>When I first visited Israel in 1958, I received the impression that the whole land was covered with sand and rocks, which were thoroughly dry because of the wind. Due to the lack of rain, the soil was not able to hold together. On the one hand, there was no rain, and on the other hand, the wind blew continuously. Ultimately, the soil was blown away, and what remained was dry land. Dry land was everywhere. For several hundred years, the wind has continued to blow over the land of Palestine and there has been little rain. After hundreds and thousands of years, the land is as described in Deuteronomy 28:23: &ldquo;Your sky, which is above your head, will be bronze, and the land, which is under you, iron.&rdquo; Bronze cannot bring forth rain, and iron cannot yield produce. Olive trees were the one thing growing in that land, and even their condition was poor. The olive trees were small and they had only a few roots and a few thin branches. In some areas, growing olives was the sole industry.</p>
<p>This shows that, on one hand, we should endeavor to labor, but on the other hand, if we are not right with God, we should not expect to have a rich harvest. This means that although we may exert our effort in God&rsquo;s word, if there is a barrier between us and God, we should not expect a rich harvest; rather, we will receive nothing. Anyone can read the Bible. Mr. Hu Shih, a Chinese scholar, read the Bible. He was an important leader who introduced significant literary reforms in China in the early part of the twentieth century. He was a person who had read many books. Eventually, he grouped the Chinese Union Version of the Bible with a number of popular books of Chinese fiction; he understood the Bible in the same way he understood fiction. Moreover, he considered the two most well known works of fiction in the Chinese language and the Chinese Union Version as three excellent books that best show the progress of vernacular Chinese. If people understand the Bible in this way, they will not receive blessing. This is why Mr. Hu Shih was never saved.</p>
<p>Although reading the Bible is right, a person must also be right in order to reap the benefits of reading. What kind of book the Bible is depends on the kind of person reading it. Mr. Hu Shih sought for the improvement of vernacular Chinese; thus, the only thing he found in the Bible was progress in vernacular Chinese. He did not see anything else in the Bible. If a person is not right, his heart too will not be right, and as a result, neither his pursuit nor his goal will be right. This makes it difficult for a person to reap anything positive.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
