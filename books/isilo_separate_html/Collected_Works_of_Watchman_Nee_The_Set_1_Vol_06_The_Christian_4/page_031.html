In Luke 18:14, the Lord Jesus tells us about the end of a Pharisee and a tax collector. The Pharisee was a very moral man; he was very zealous for religion. The tax collector was a very immoral person and had no desire for the things of God. In this chapter of the Scripture, the Lord Jesus says that both went up to the temple to pray. The good Pharisee was not willing to humble himself and confess that he was a sinner; he was not willing to ask for God's grace. The evil tax collector knew that he had no righteousness to merit God's favor. He, therefore, confessed his sins, humbled himself before God, and prayed for God to propitiate his sins. In this verse the Lord Jesus tells us the different endings of the two men. "I tell you, This man [the tax collector] went down to his house justified rather than that one [the Pharisee]; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted." The Lord Jesus tells us that the very moral Pharisee was not justified, while the very unlawful tax collector was justified. The meaning of justification is not only forgiveness. Forgiveness implies having sins but that such sins are forgiven. Justification, however, means that one is declared sinless. Therefore, we see a man who thought that he had no sins but who was, nevertheless, condemned by God; and we also see a man who thought that he did have sins who was declared sinless by God. Why was such a moral Pharisee condemned? And why was such an immoral tax collector justified? There is no other reason than that "everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted." If we make it more plain, the meaning of justification is to go to heaven and the meaning of not being justified is to go to hell. Therefore, we see a proud person going to hell. Those who are proud will go to hell! They will certainly go to hell! Therefore, O proud ones, be careful. We have three more verses that we have to read. "The Lord will destroy the house of the proud" (Prov. 15:25). "Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord /...he shall not be unpunished" (Prov. 16:5). "Jehovah of hosts will have a day / Over everything proud and lofty, / And over everything lifted up that it may be abased" (Isa. 2:12). These few verses tell us clearly that the proud will be judged; they will be judged on the day God judges men, and they will go to hell and suffer an eternal suffering. The Bible mentions repeatedly that the proud will go to hell. Therefore, if you want to go to hell, please be proud. By being proud, you will have a way to reach your desired destination: hell!</P><P>What is pride? The meaning of pride is to uplift yourself and put yourself in a position that you have not attained. Pride is to claim that you are more than you really are. The Lord Jesus pointed this out clearly in Luke 18. The Lord Jesus said that the Pharisee was self-exalting and proud. How was he self-exalting and proud? His morals were indeed exemplary. But he would not admit that he was a sinner before God and in His light. He was reporting his merits to God. He did not mention his weaknesses, failures, falls, and sins. He would not admit that he was a sinner. He tried to vindicate his righteousness before God. This then was his pride. He was proud because he was not willing to confess that he was a sinner, even though before God he was a sinner and not righteous. On the contrary, he hastily claimed that he was a righteous man before God. God did not interfere with his pride! He allowed the Pharisee to justify himself! God allowed him to become satisfied with himself; He did not argue with him! But God did not justify him. Rather, He let him perish and suffer in hell!</P><P>Therefore, the real meaning of pride is to be unwilling to humble yourself before God, to confess that you are a sinner, and to receive the merit of the substitutional death and the shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus for salvation. Proud people perish, not because they are proud, but because their pride hinders them from being saved. Pride is but one sin. The Lord Jesus has died for all the sins of men. He has borne all the punishment for our sins. Pride is but one of our sins. This sin has been judged on the cross. However, if we do not remove pride, we will not believe in the Lord Jesus' death for us, and we will not receive eternal life. Proud people perish because their pride hinders them from being saved.</P><P>Unless a man confesses that he has sinned and stands on the position of a sinner, he will not receive the Lord Jesus as his Savior. I am a preacher of the gospel. Until today, I have not seen a man who will not confess his own sins but who will believe in the substitutional death of the Lord, and who is saved. In order to be saved, one has to be humble and confess that he is a sinner. I remember one time I was preaching at a place. I was preaching privately to a high school teacher one night. He asked me many questions concerning Christianity and other religions. We had a discussion for a long time. But his questions kept coming. I then told him that none of his questions were the basic question. It is not necessary to solve many problems before a man can believe in the Lord Jesus as his Savior. I told him that one thing is the most crucial of all. It is the first qualification for believing in Christ. It is confessing that one is a sinner. If you do not confess that you are a sinner, no matter how many answers you have received to difficult questions, you will not be helped to believe in Christ. If you confess that you are a sinner and feel that you are in sin, bound by sin, and fear the punishment of sin, you will surely seek a Savior. But this man was very unclear about sin; sometimes he confessed that he had sinned, and sometimes he did not feel that he had sinned. Later I told him, "If you do not know for sure that you are a sinner, you will not be able to understand the crucial doctrine of redemption in the Bible." We talked until almost midnight and there was still no result. In the end I told him one word, "Please consider your own sins some more! If you do, many of your questions will be answered." After a few days, the man indeed realized his sins and believed in the unique sin-substituting Savior, Jesus Christ. Please think more about your own sins now! If you will humble yourself to confess that you are a sinner, you will be saved. If you remain proud and do not confess, your pride will send you to hell. Therefore, if you want to go to hell, you should willfully deceive yourselves; you can be willfully proud and can willfully refuse to admit that you are sinners. You will go down to hell. In hell there is no need of humility!</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
