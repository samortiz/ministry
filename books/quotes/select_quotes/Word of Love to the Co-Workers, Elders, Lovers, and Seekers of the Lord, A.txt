If each regenerated believer would bear one fruit yearly, within less than twenty years, the entire world would be saved
After almost two thousand years of church history, today's situation related to fruit-bearing is far short of what it should be
Since the end of World War II, the Muslim religion, not Christianity, has been the religion with the most increase
Man's multiplication, man's fruit-bearing, is not by mass production but by individual persons bearing children to have a family
The evangelists in Christianity have big gospel campaigns to convert many people, but where are those people today?
We may bring several thousand people together to hear the gospel, and take many names, but how many of them do we really gain practically?
We may say that whether they remain in the church or not, they are still saved persons, but this is not practical
Since thousands of fish are passing around us day by day, how can we say that we cannot catch one of them within one year?
My burden in this message is how to work on the campus and how to have the brothers' and sisters' homes in particular
The goal of those who catch and gain new ones on the campuses is to bring them into the brothers' and sisters' homes
If our raising of our children could decide their spiritual future, this would be against God's predestination
According to my observation in Taipei it is better not to exercise any demand on the young people who live in our brothers and sisters homes
We thank the Lord that we have the brothers' and sisters' homes as 'fishing hooks' and some young people have been hooked
Ephesians 6:4 says 'Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord'
If one is offended by his child, he becomes a provocation to him, and he loses his capacity to discipline the child
There is much profit for brothers from one part of the country to visit another, not to teach or merely to learn but simply to observe
To me, shepherding means everything for the brothers' and sisters' homes, for the vital groups, for the church, and for the elders
We may do the work of the ministry, but the unfitting manner in which we behave and conduct ourselves kills our ministry
We are taking care of the brothers' and sisters' homes, but how do we conduct ourselves, how do we behave, and what way do we take?
Ephesians is a very high book, but it comes down to say, 'Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation'
In 10:10 He says, 'I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly,' and in verse 11 He says, 'I am the good Shepherd'
Even in our human life, family life, and marriage life there is the need of shepherding, and shepherding requires cherishing
In this message we will fellowship concerning how we should learn of the Lord to shepherd people according to His heart
If we hate each other, we will have endless strife, but love covers not only one sin or some sins, but all sins
We would rather be like the sons of Noah who covered their father's nakedness which was due to his drunkenness
Those who uncover suffer the curse, but those who cover others' sins, defects, and shortcomings enjoy, gain, and receive blessing
Forgiven in verse 15, as in Psalm 32:1, which says, 'Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven; / Whose sin is covered'
The heart of our God is to love not only righteous men but sinners, even the world, which is worse than mere sinners
The entire human race became the world, just as the entire divine race, the new race, will become the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is the totality the consummation of the eternal life while the world is the totality the consummation of the fallen race
Because all the people on this earth became flesh, God decided to temporarily forsake the world, which He loved, for a purpose
The world indicates man becoming one with Satan, becoming Satan's cosmos, the satanic system that systematizes all people
God loved the human race, the worst human people, with the intention that they all may participate in the New Jerusalem
In the beginning there is God as the eternal life, and the consummation of God as the eternal life is the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is still under a consummating work, and this consummating work is the flow of the divine life
John 4:10 says, 'Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins'
When the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?
If one is healthy enough to live properly in corporate living, he does not need a vital group as a 'health clinic'
He was there among the sinners and tax collectors, eating and feasting with them, reclining at the table and enjoying with them
We need to be discipled to have the divine concept the concept of the Fathers heart and the heart of the Lord Jesus who came to save sinners
The way to overcome the degradation of the church 'The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you' (2 Tim 4:22)
We should not say that we are the class of people who live with the Lord, walk with the Lord, and work with the Lord
Some may claim that they are the class of saints who are able to live in corporate living, but in actuality and practicality they are not
In the eyes of God, everyone is not lovable in themselves, yet God still loves them; that is, He loves the world
God wants us to be the God-men at the top of the heavenly ladder, but we may not even be on the first rung of the ladder
They simply need to go back and be more conformed to the death of Christ and to live the divine life by denying themselves
We may say that we are able to live in corporate living, but eventually we will find out that we are not
You may want to be an emperor in your district, with everything under your control and rule and where everyone must listen to you
No one is of Cephas, no one is of Apollos, no one is of Paul, the highest apostle, and no one is even of Christ separately from others
We do not have fruit because we are lacking in the Father's loving and forgiving heart and the Son's shepherding and seeking spirit
The Pharisees and scribes brought a sinful woman to the Lord and said, 'In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women'
They charged the Lord to say something, so He said, 'He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her'
Matthew 16:24 says, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
To not conform to the death of Christ is to not absolutely deny your self, not others' self, and bear the cross
A person may boast of his race or that he is from a certain country with a prideful spirit and an air of superiority
If we deal with these four matters the Lords recovery will immediately have a revival and within one month we will see fruit as the result
Intensification is not only to give you more of the Spirit; it is also to cause you to be conformed sevenfold to the death of Christ
When we see the ripened harvest / Of the golden countryside / We may know that many seeds have / Fallen to the earth and died
They can make you more ambitious because they give you more capacity, and they can make you prouder because you now have the high peaks
In the Old Testament the people were not allowed to put honey in the meal offering; rather, they put in salt, which kills germs
You must learn to condemn and reject your self to the uttermost and simply take care of the Lords interest of His recovery and not your work
Lord, come and fellowship with us, and grant us Your fellowship that we may have the freedom to fellowship with one another
The history among us proves that those who became somewhat capable, possessing a certain 'spiritual capacity,' eventually became a problem
Generally speaking, there have been only two or three occasions of rebellion among us, but in actuality, there have been many
You must beware of four things: ambition, pride, self-justification, and the self, the natural man, the disposition
One who makes himself attractive is wrong already, and if you are attracted to follow him, you help him to be wrong
attuned in 1 Cor 1:10 means to repair, to restore, to adjust, to mend, making a broken thing thoroughly complete, joined perfectly together
One whom we follow should be a person loving the Lord, living for the Lord, and renouncing his self, natural life, preference, and ambition
The first one proposed a way to go, the second one proposed a better way, and the third one proposed yet another way that would save time
The three argued for so long that by the time they finished arguing, they could have been there no matter what way they went
In the church life in the Lord's recovery we all have to learn how to give in, even if it means that we suffer
Your intention may be to protect the recovery from mistakes, but in actuality your insistence on your preference is the biggest mistake
Those dear ones especially who are born with a strong character must be aware of their strong character in insisting on their preference
One whom we follow must hold the complete revelation of the entire holy Scriptures properly without any twisting and deforming
Many Christians today argue with one another, but very few know that in the Bible there is such a thing as the eternal economy of God
The accepting of the divine revelation must also be governed by Christ as the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy
It did not speak of God's economy as a plan but of God's economy in our being concerning our spirit, our mind, our will, and our emotion
The fountain is God the Father, the spring is God the Son, and the river is God the Spirit flowing as living water into eternal life
From Genesis to Revelation the entire Bible speaks only about this flowing Triune God, and the issue of Their flowing is the New Jerusalem
Lord, in spite of all these defects and mistakes made by us, we are not disheartened, discouraged, or disappointed
Rather, Lord, we are very much encouraged by You, by what You are, by what You have done, and by what You are still doing
Lord, do saturate us and soak us to be everything within us, to be our faith, our joy, our peace, our rest, and our comfort
