<h2 class=head2>40. Setting Up His Kingdom in the Millennium</h2><p>God will set up His kingdom in the millennium. Matthew 13:43 refers to this: “Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” The kingdom of the Father is the heavenly part of the millennium, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. The “righteous” in this verse are the overcomers, who will be the light shining in the kingdom of their Father. In the heavenly part of the millennium, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of the Father, the overcoming saints will reign with Christ as co-kings.<p>Revelation 20:6 indicates that the overcomers “shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with Him a thousand years.” This thousand-year reign refers to the kingdom of the Father, which God will set up in the millennium. In this part of the millennium Christ and the overcomers will reign for the Father’s expression and satisfaction.<h2 class=head2>41. Putting All the Enemies under the Feet of Christ at the End of the Millennium</h2><p>At the end of the millennium God will put all the enemies under the feet of Christ. First Corinthians 15:25 says, “For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.” The longer Christ reigns, the more enemies are put under His feet. Eventually, at the end of the millennium, the last age of the old creation, every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ. The word “until” indicates this and points to the end of the thousand years. That will be the time when God has put every enemy under Christ’s feet.<h2 class=head2>42. Abolishing the Last Enemy, Death</h2><p>The last aspect of God’s work in the new dispensation will be the abolishing of the last enemy, death. First Corinthians 15:26 says, “The last enemy that is being abolished is death.” Immediately after the fall of man, God began His work to abolish sin and death. This work has been progressing through the Old and New Testament ages and is still in process today. When sin is done away with at the end of the old creation and when its source, Satan, is cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:7-10), death will be abolished. It also will be cast into the lake of fire with Hades, its power, after the last and final judgment at the white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). The lake of fire is the “trash can” for the entire universe, into which all negative things, including death and Hades (Rev. 20:14), will be cast. Death will be the last enemy destroyed by God.<p>All that God has done and all that He will do is for the purpose of dispensing Himself into His chosen people. God is working to remove all the obstacles and to prepare the way to dispense Himself into all of His chosen people to accomplish His eternal economy. It is not sufficient for us merely to know about this—we need to see it. If we see what God is doing and the purpose for it, then we shall know where we need to be—continually under His dispensing. Therefore, let us remain in God’s presence so that He may have the opportunity to infuse into us all He is and all He has. This is our burden in these messages.
