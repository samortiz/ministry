   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Second, God Touching the Emotion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without exception, God first comes to touch our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second, God touches our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If people had no emotion, no one could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be saved is truly an emotional matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can preach the gospel to a chair, but it cannot be saved because it has no emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever God touches our mind, He always follows to touch our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the best way to preach the gospel is first to bring a little knowledge about God and Christ and then to tell people about God's love and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This touches people's emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not argue too much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I observed a brother who is an expert in gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He never argues with people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He tells people, "Friend, you have to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You need Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If someone argues, the brother simply says, "Oh, God loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus loves you and is waiting for you."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first few words touch the person's mind; then all the following words touch his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes there is no need to touch people's mind purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can simply preach about God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This one "stone" will kill two "birds."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, people's minds will be touched, and their emotions will be stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mind is first, and the emotions are second.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Third, God Touching the Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, God touches the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to know how to deal with people in God's way, we have to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After we say something about God's love, when people's emotions are stirred up by our preaching, we need to say something about God's law and people's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This hits the conscience, causing people to condemn themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two easiest ways to preach the gospel are to preach concerning God's love and to preach concerning people's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lastly, God Touching the Will</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then when the mind is enlightened, the emotions are stirred up, and the conscience is convicted, a person makes the decision to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This decision is the exercise of the will, which is the last step.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, I know many persons who, after listening to the gospel, were enlightened by God in their mind, touched in their emotion, and convicted in their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, however, their will would not cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They hardened their will like Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Exodus says many times that Pharaoh hardened his heart and even God hardened his heart for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the heart is hardened, what part of it is hardened?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is the will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To harden the heart is to be stubborn in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need these four steps: the mind enlightened, the emotion stirred up, the conscience convicted, and the will submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we can deal with God in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These four steps of God's dealing are good not only for unbelievers but also for His dealing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the New Testament tells us that after we are saved, our mind must be transformed by renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be renewed is simply to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, our mind must be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then the New Testament tells us many times that we have to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first steps of God's dealing with us as believers are that our mind is renewed and our emotion is stirred up to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then our conscience always needs to be convicted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be convicted that we are wrong, we are short of God's glory, and we are disobedient to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need this kind of conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, we have to make the decision by our will to seek God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our mind must be enlightened, renewed, and transformed; our emotion must be stirred up and encouraged; our conscience must be convicted; and our will must be soft and submissive to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are the steps in God's dealing.</S>
