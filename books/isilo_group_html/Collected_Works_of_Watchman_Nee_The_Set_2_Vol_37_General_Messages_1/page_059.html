Brothers and sisters, I am not saying that God's will can be understood without pursuing it. I am saying that God's will is in us also; it is in us together with His life. This word is not for everyone but for those who are regenerated, who have the mind of Christ, and who know in a serious way the meaning of abiding in the Lord and having the Lord's word abide in them. Their will is the will of God. If they wish to have something, God will want it too. If they want something which is contrary to what God wants, they will feel like a deflated tire within. There will be no response within, and they will not be able to pray at all. If it is a wish that they cannot justify in themselves, can it be something that God wants? One day, when all of our self-motives are removed, our will will be one with God's will. When we will, God will will, and when we do not will, God will not will.</p><p>Romans 14:23 says, "All that is not out of faith is sin." This is the principle of the Christian life. The faith mentioned here is different from the faith mentioned in other places in the Bible. In other places, faith refers to one's faith in God. Here faith refers to one's faith in himself in doing the right thing. "All that is not out of faith is sin." This means if you have condemned yourself already, how can you expect God to justify you when He is so much greater than you? If our heart condemns us, we must be wrong. If what we do is right, God will give us the faith to believe that it is right. If what we do is wrong, we will not have this faith. Even after we have done it, we will still not be able to say with certainty that we have done the right thing, and we will feel empty within. When this happens, we will be certain that we are wrong. Since our heart has condemned us already, and since God is greater than our heart, surely He will condemn us also.</p><p>Paul said that if anyone invites us to a meal, we can go if we wish to go. This word is not for irresponsible Christians. Needless to say, it is not for unregenerated ones. But even a regenerated person who has never done God's will and has never lived for God is not qualified to take this word. One must abide in the Lord, and the Lord's word must abide in him before he can go as he wishes. If he should not go to a certain place, his inner being will not be able to muster enough strength to wish to go. If he tries to go anyway, something within will weaken him, advise him, and tell him that he cannot go. He is controlled by the law of life, and his will becomes a reflection of God's will. His wish becomes God's wish. We often want to do something by ourselves, and there is often the opportunity to do it by ourselves. But strangely, the minute we try to do it according to our own will, our inner being does not respond. The minute we do it, we feel squelched. The more we go on, the unhappier and weaker we become. In the end, we can only give it up because something within us is stronger than our own will.</p><p>God often directs us according to the willingness in our heart. For example, a person may invite us to a certain place, and we may desire to go. But strangely, even though we want to go, we cannot muster enough strength to say that we want to go. Our inner being is cold and unresponsive. Outwardly we want to go, but inwardly everything is cold. We cannot go, and if we do, every step we take brings more complaints and protests from within; something within will not let us go. This is God's will manifested through our will. But this word does not apply to everyone; it only applies to those who have God's life, who abide in the Lord, and in whom the Lord's word abides.</p><p>Consider the case of Paul casting out the spirit when he was in Philippi. A slave girl was possessed by a spirit, and following after Paul, she cried, "These men are slaves of the Most High God." Paul did not do anything for a few days. Should not Paul have cast out the spirit? He should have cast out demons the minute he saw them, yet Paul did not! His mouth could not move because his inner being had not moved. When his inner being was not moved, it meant that God was not moved. One day Paul became disturbed, and he said to the spirit, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." Immediately the spirit came out of her (Acts 16:16-18). For Paul to be disturbed meant that God was disturbed. He spoke only when his inner being moved. Once he spoke, the spirit was cast out. God's word was in him; therefore, what he spoke was God's will.</p><p>The experiences of many believers testify to this. Sometimes someone suggests that we go and visit a brother, but nothing within us moves. If we go, we find it very awkward. But when our inner being moves and we have the word, a visit to our brother will bring in very good fellowship. We must wait until our inner being moves before we move in any outward way. If our inner being does not move, we should not move in any outward way.</p><p>While Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy, he saw a whole city full of idols, and "his spirit was provoked within him" (17:16). Some may think that it is not a good thing to be "provoked." But Paul's provocation was a good thing. He was provoked by what he saw, and he went to preach at the Areopagus. The words he preached became an important part of the holy Scripture. On that occasion in Athens, Paul gave a good testimony. It was something that came from his heart, and he was constrained to speak it.</p><p>Another example can be seen in Paul's determination to pass Ephesus (20:16). He made the decision to do this. The Bible does not say that God decided, but Paul decided. Some Christians often say, "God's will has led me here. It is God's will that I should do this." They seem to be more spiritual than Paul. We do not see Paul speaking in such spiritual terms. Yet his decision fully corresponded with God's will because he was a person who knew the cross and feared God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FORBIDDING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Some may ask, "Wasn't there the danger of Paul making a mistake when he made his decision that way?" There is not a simple answer to this. In Acts, after Paul set out from Antioch, there was no clear record of the leading of the Holy Spirit. Yet the Bible clearly records the forbidding of the Holy Spirit. Other than the vision at night (16:9), we see very little leading of the Holy Spirit in Paul on the positive side. We mainly see the forbidding of the Holy Spirit on the negative side.</p><p>If we abide in the Lord and His word abides in us, whatever decision we make will be God's will. But there is still the possibility of mistakes. If we make a mistake, the Holy Spirit will forbid us and not let us go. Paul's experience tells us this.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we do not have to be passive. Many Christians want to do God's will, yet they are too passive. God's will does not make a person passive. A man is passive because he does not understand God's will. If we are genuinely dealt with by the cross and are abiding in the Lord with His word abiding in us, God's will will become manifest in us, and we can act according to such a will within. If we are wrong, the Holy Spirit will stop us. He will make us indecisive; we will feel like a deflated tire, and we will sense that something is wrong, that it is meaningless to do such a thing, and that we cannot do it anymore. May the Lord deliver us from all misunderstanding and foolishness and save us from passivity. May He grant us an active attitude, and may He make us those who follow Him all the way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
