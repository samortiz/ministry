   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord answered, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven v. 22 . Then He used a parable to explain what He meant vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>23-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 35 says, So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not forgive our brother who sins against us, we will be disciplined by the Lord; only once we have forgiven him from our heart will the Lord forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not practice the way of repenting and forgiving, the longer we remain in the church life, the more offenses will accumulate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the end the accumulation of offenses will cause us to lose the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord grant us the grace that we need.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only when we enjoy Christ as our joy and life supply will we be tenderhearted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are tenderhearted, we will forgive others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In our daily life we need to forgive others and ask for others forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is necessary because we are easily offended, and we easily offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we offend others, we need to ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are offended, we need to forgive, even as God in Christ also forgave us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Colossians 3:13 Paul says, Bearing one another and forgiving one another, if anyone should have a complaint against anyone; even as the Lord forgave you, so also should you forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The forgiving Lord is our life and lives within us; forgiving is a virtue of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we take Him as our life and our person and live by Him, our forgiving of others will be spontaneous; it will become a virtue of our Christian life.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once we have forgiven someone concerning a certain matter, we should never mention it again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To mention the offense indicates that we have not released the person who offended us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the New Testament, to forgive is to forget and to release.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to forget the offense and release the offender.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once we have done this, we should never mention the matter again.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should always be careful and watchful not to offend others, and at the same time, we should always be willing to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>K. Being Built in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the believers corporately experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by living in the church life, they are being built up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In regard to Christ being the cornerstone, Paul says in Ephesians 2:22, In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word you refers to the saints in a particular locality, and the word also indicates that the building is local.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the context, the dwelling place of God in verse 22 is local, whereas the holy temple in verse 21 is universal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 22 Paul says that the local saints, the saints in Ephesus, were being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, in verses 21 through 22 Paul speaks of the universal aspect as well as the local aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the building...is growing refers to the universal aspect; being built together refers to the local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In these verses Paul carefully points out that it is in Christ that local saints are built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not being built together in regulation, practice, or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can only be built together in the all-inclusive Christ, who is our peace, foundation, and cornerstone.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Moreover, when we are built together, we become the dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The word spirit in verse 22 refers to the believers human spirit, which is indwelt by the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God s Spirit is the Dweller, not the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The dwelling place is the believers spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the dwelling place of God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 21 speaks of a holy temple in the Lord, while verse 22 speaks of a dwelling place of God in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These verses show that the Lord and our spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To be in our spirit is to be in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Likewise, to be in the Lord is to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is impossible to separate our spirit from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, our spirit is the place in which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The building is not in our mind, emotion, will, soul, or heart; rather, it is altogether a matter in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For this reason, if we desire to be built in a locality, our disposition and our being must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nothing can test the degree of our spiritual maturity like the building.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Furthermore, to be built in a locality is a great help to our spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are willing to be built into the church in our locality, we will greatly grow in life.</S>
