   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORSAKEN BY GOD ECONOMICALLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since we have pointed out that the Lord Jesus died on the cross as the God-man, some may wonder about Mark 15:34: At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was the Lord s cry during the time He was bearing our sins 1 Pet 2:24 , being made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 , and taking the place of sinners 1 Pet 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that God judged Him as our Substitute for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the sight of God, Christ became a great sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because Christ was our Substitute and was made sin in the sight of God, God judged Him and even forsook Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Matthew 1 and Luke 1, the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, for His ministry, He was anointed with the Holy Spirit, who descended upon Him Luke 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to realize that before the anointing Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus economically, He already had, essentially, the begetting Spirit as the divine essence within Him as one of the two essences of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we need to see that the begetting Spirit as the divine essence never left Him essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even when He was on the cross crying out, My God, My God, why did You forsake Me?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He still had the begetting Spirit as the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then who left Him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was the anointing Spirit through whom He presented Himself to God Heb 9:14 who left Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After God accepted Christ as the all-inclusive offering, the anointing Spirit left Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But although the anointing Spirit left Him economically, He still had the begetting Spirit essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God s judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, He was forsaken by the righteous and judging God economically.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was conceived and born of the Holy Spirit essentially and therefore the Holy Spirit was one of the essences of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the Lord Jesus grew up and lived on earth, He had the Holy Spirit within Him essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later, when He was baptized, He already had the Holy Spirit as an essential part of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, at the time of His baptism the Holy Spirit descended upon Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that the Lord Jesus had the Holy Spirit as one of the essences of His being essentially and also that the Holy Spirit descended upon Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean, of course, that there are two Holy Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It means that the one Holy Spirit has two aspects the essential and the economical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The essential aspect was for the being, the existence, of the Lord Jesus, and the economical aspect was for His work, His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be impressed with the fact that when the Lord Jesus was on the cross dying for our sins, God was in Him essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the One who died for our sins was the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But at a certain point the righteous God, while judging this God-man, left Him economically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s forsaking of Christ was an economical matter related to the carrying out of God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit and was born of God and with God, He had the Holy Spirit as the intrinsic essence of His divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, it was not possible for God to leave, to forsake, Him essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, He was forsaken by God economically when the Spirit, who had descended upon Him as the economical power for the carrying out of His ministry, left Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the essence of God remained in His being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, He died on the cross as the God-man, and the blood He shed there for our redemption was the blood not only of the man Jesus, but also the blood of the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, this blood, through which God obtained the church, is God s own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE PRECIOUSNESS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let us read Acts 20:28 again: Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers, to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained through His own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here, in His charge to the elders of the church in Ephesus, Paul speaks both of the Holy Spirit and of God s own blood in order to indicate his feeling concerning the preciousness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Paul s understanding, the church is altogether precious.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is under the care of the Holy Spirit, and the church has been bought by God with His own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the church is a treasure in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul treasured the church even as God does.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 20:28 Paul charged the elders to treasure the church as God does and he did.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fact that God purchased the church with His own blood indicates the preciousness of the church in His sight.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Having paid such a price for the church, the church surely is dear to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, the church is under the care of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to Paul s word in verse 28, the elders should consider the church very precious, regarding it as a treasure in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The elders, in shepherding the church, should have the same feeling about the church that God has.</S>
