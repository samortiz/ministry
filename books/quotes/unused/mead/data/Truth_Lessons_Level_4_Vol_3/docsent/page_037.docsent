   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the progressing stage of God s full salvation, the believers experience and enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God will also issue in their looking to and waiting for the Lord Jesus coming back to usher them into their future.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now we are looking to that glorious day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are waiting for the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The living of worldly people gives the impression that their future is on the earth and that their hope, destiny, and destination are thoroughly related to the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this is not our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are waiting for the Son of God to come from the heavens; hence, our future is focused on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To await the appearing of the Lord is a normal sign of true believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to 1 Thessalonians 1:9 and 10, we have turned to God from idols not only to serve a living and true God but also to await His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 1:7 says that we are eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two portions of the Word indicate an important characteristic of our Christian life: awaiting the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As Christians, we must live a life of awaiting God s Son from the heavens, a life that declares to others that our hope is not on this earth or in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, our hope is in the coming Lord, and our future is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On this earth we do not have any destiny, destination, or future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our future, our destiny, and our destination are altogether focused on the Lord who is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is our hope, our future, and our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ Phil 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our national life is not in any earthly country; it is in the heavens.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to remember, therefore, that we are a heavenly people sojourning on earth, awaiting the Savior, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While experiencing the stage of transformation in God s full salvation by the dispensing of the processed Triune God and after reading various portions of the Scriptures regarding the Lord s coming, we should, like John, express the desire from our deepest part as a prayer to hasten the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our prayer should be Come, Lord Jesus! which is also the last prayer in the Bible Rev 22:20 .</S>
