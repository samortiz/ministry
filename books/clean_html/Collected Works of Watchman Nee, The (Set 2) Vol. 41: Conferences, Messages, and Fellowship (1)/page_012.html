<h2 class="head2">The Man in Romans 7 (August 2)</h2><p>Chapters one through eight of Romans are doctrinal, nine through eleven are illustrative, and twelve through sixteen are experiential. Chapter seven describes the condition of a person before he is saved. The proof of this is in verse 14. Verses 1 through 6 describe the condition of a saved person, whereas verse 14 describes the condition of an unsaved person. Verse 6 says that we (the saved ones) have died to the law in which we were held and are therefore discharged or freed from the law. Yet verse 14 says that we are fleshy, sold under sin. This must refer to an unsaved person, because this person is not yet freed from the law. (July 25)</p><p>In the Solomon Islands, there was a worker called Northcote Codeck, who claimed that his work had no need of Romans 7, because he taught consecration from the beginning.</p><h2 class="head2">The Man Who Sinned in 1 Corinthians 5<br />(August 2)</h2><p>First Corinthians 5 mentions the fornicators, the covetous, the idolaters, revilers, drunkards, and those who are rapacious (v. 11). These are not verbs but descriptions. They describe certain kinds of persons.</p><h2 class="head2">Paradise (July 31)</h2><p>Hades is in the center of the earth; it is divided into a suffering part and Paradise (see Luke 16:22-26). In 2 Corinthians 12:2 and 4, the original Greek says that Paul was caught up to the third heavens and was caught away to Paradise. The Lord said that He would be in the center of the earth for three days (Matt. 12:40). On the cross He told the thief who was crucified beside Him that he would be with Him in Paradise that same day (Luke 23:43). This proves that Paradise is in the center of the earth. Ephesians 4:8 says that the Lord led captive those taken captive; it does not say that he led Paradise captive and took Paradise to the third heavens. This proves that Paradise and the third heavens are in two different places.</p><h2 class="head2">The Subject of the Book of Philippians (July 28)</h2><p>The subject of the book of Philippians is not rejoicing, but the exhortation of two sisters to be reconciled to each other. In chapter one, Paul showed that he was always reconciled to others. In chapter two, he showed that Christ was always reconciled to God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Three Peaks in the New Testament (July 28)</h2><p>There are three peaks in the New Testament: Romans, Ephesians, and Hebrews. Romans is on sin and salvation, Ephesians is on the church in eternity, and Hebrews is on the Lord as the High Priest.</p><h2 class="head2">The Second Epistles in the New Testament<br />(July 28)</h2><p>Why are there the first and the second epistles in the New Testament? This is because man did not take heed to the first epistle, and there was the need to write a second epistle. Hence, every second epistle mentions the subject of separation. For example, 2 Corinthians 6:17 mentions separation from the unclean; 2 Timothy 3:5 mentions turning away from those who have an outward form of godliness.</p><p>Second Timothy mainly tells us to turn back to three things: the teaching of Paul, to the Old Testament, and to turn away from those who have an outward form of godliness in order to turn back to the reality of godliness.</p><p>Today the church is in desolation. The ones mentioned in 2 Timothy 3 are those who are in the church. Hence, there is the need for some to separate themselves to be the overcomers. Of the seven churches in Revelation, the first three have passed away: (1) The church in Ephesus signifies the church at the time of the apostles. (2) The church in Smyrna signifies the suffering church, which was persecuted by the Roman emperors. (3) The church in Pergamos saw the gradual formation of the papal system. The last four churches will remain until the Lord comes back: (4) The church in Thyatira, which is the Roman Catholic Church, with the papal corruption. This is the church prior to the time of Martin Luther. (5) The church in Sardis, which signifies the Protestant church. This was the beginning of the recovery of the church. (6) The church in Philadelphia, which signifies the faithful little flock. (7) The church in Laodicea, which signifies a degradation from the church in Philadelphia.</p><h2 class="head2">The City in Revelation (August 2)</h2><p>In Genesis the serpent crept in because there was a garden. But in Revelation the serpent can no longer creep in, because there is a city.</p>
