A man's spirit carries his own taste and color. When our spirit is released, it expresses the tastes and color of our very person. In order to be right in our spirit, we have to go through dealings. The quality of a man determines the quality of his spirit. When a man is regenerated, the new spirit that God gives him is the same in quality as that which is given to any other person. If a man learns little and goes through few dealings, his spirit will remain in darkness. Doctrinally, this matter is very simple. A man with a good mind can repeat the content, tone, teaching, and style of a preacher. He may think that he has the right spirit by doing this. But we can observe a very interesting thing among Christians. They can pick up others' doctrines, yet their spirit remains unchanged; the two will not mix. A brother can be the same as others are in words and tone, but his spirit will remain the same as before. There will not be any advance; his spirit will not be any purer. If a man does not have a pure spirit, he will find that his spirit is incompatible with the good words released from those with a pure spirit. He can give another person's message, but he will not have the other person's spirit.</p><p>The Lord has given me a burden to test if young workers are qualified to work for the Lord. Most brothers and sisters think that in working for the Lord the main thing is to have right teachings. But I only pay ten percent of my attention to a person's message. I pay ninety percent of my attention to his spirit. A man can give a logical message but have a rebellious, coarse, nit-picking, evil, proud, or hardened spirit. The unbelievers can only be proud; they cannot have a proud spirit. A Christian can have a proud spirit. When he opens his mouth, he releases his spirit. If a Christian has a wrong motive in his heart, the spirit he releases will be wrong. A young person can pray for breaking; he can give a message on breaking, but his very person may still not be broken. It is possible for a man to deceive himself, but it is not easy to deceive God and the church. The church can tell where a person is from his spirit.</p><p>A man's spirit is the place where God works and dwells. God leaves His imprint in a man's spirit. A brother once wrote to me, saying, "All the brothers and sisters say that I am wrong. Even you say that I am wrong. It seems that everyone is right and I am always wrong. Since all of you say that I am wrong, I will just say that I am wrong." Such a word conveyed a hardened spirit. After I read the letter, I wrote back to him, saying, "The more you are smitten, the harder you become. The more you are dealt with, the less you submit. Your words and conduct may be right, but your spirit is wrong." A few months ago, I saw this brother again. His spirit was changed. He had not picked up more doctrines, but the quality of his spirit was enhanced. We have the same opportunity to exercise our spirit as any other brother or sister. When a certain person has greater wisdom, eloquence, ability, and gift than you do, he does not necessarily have greater opportunity to exercise his spirit. God arranges all circumstances and things with the goal of dealing with ourselves and training our spirit. For this reason, we have to give in more to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Here we need to speak about the discipline of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not only in us as our life; He is ordering our circumstances for the purpose of training us. He knows the kind of environment that is best for us. This is the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Every environment that comes upon us has been measured by our God. The unbelievers have accidents and coincidences, but not a Christian. The Lord Jesus tells us that every hair on our head is numbered by the Father. A sparrow may not be worth much. If a man buys four, he gets one extra for free. But without the Father's permission, not one will fall to the ground. We are more precious than the birds (Matt. 10:29-31). Everything that is happening to us in our environment, even the falling of a hair and the grounding of a bird, is under God's sovereignty. The purpose of this sovereignty is to perfect us. The daily discipline of the Holy Spirit is for the purpose of dealing with the self and destroying it. In this way the quality of the spirit is enhanced and purified. If we seek for ease and comfort and run away from the Spirit-ordered environments, we may reduce our troubles, but the quality of our spirit will not be enriched and purified.</p><p>Those who have an impoverished spirit were not impoverished at the beginning; they became impoverished because they refused to allow the Lord to work in them. If we are willing to submit ourselves to the discipline of the Holy Spirit, our spirit will become strong and pure.</p><p>A person may be a Christian for twenty or thirty years. He may even have been a revivalist conducting revivals for thirty years. These things do not impress me at all. With some people we do not sense any noble quality in their spirit. If a man's spirit is good, we will feel refreshed and anointed as soon as we touch it. All the lessons that we have learned are impregnated in our spirit. It is impossible to pretend. The more we try to pretend, the more our falsehood will be exposed. Many people like to pretend to be spiritual in front of me; they want my approval. A sister in Shanghai once said that Brother Nee never praises anyone. She thought that no one was up to my standard. Actually, the only One who is qualified to approve of anyone is the Lord. A spiritual man will find the Lord's approval automatically. If your spirit is wrong, what use is there for me to say that I like you or that I approve you? Some people hate with all their heart but say that they love with their mouth. What comes out of the mouth is love, but what comes out of the spirit is hatred. If we are experienced, we will know as soon as we touch one's spirit. A man can pretend and cheat others, but he can never hide his spirit.</p><p>Many people are right in their words and thoughts, but they are wrong in their spirit. The quality of our spirit is governed by the extent of discipline of the Holy Spirit we have received. When the Holy Spirit condemns something, we should go along with Him and condemn the same. If we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit every day and learn to deal with our self, we will advance every day. We may not be conscious of our own progress, but others will know. In Shanghai people often knock on my door and ask to see me. When they see me, they ask, "Brother Nee, has my spirit made any progress?" Those who ask such questions usually have not made any progress. Progress is not something that we can easily detect in ourselves. Others know how our spirit is, but we do not need to know, and it is best that we not know. Moses' face shone, but he did not know it. It was the Israelites who saw it (Exo. 34:29-30). Suppose a man looks into a mirror all the time. Do you think he will find himself greatly changed from the day before? Do you think that he will know whether or not he has grown? I have never seen such a person. No one should consider his spiritual condition all the time. All we need is to learn as much as we can in our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_078.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_080.html">Next</a> </body></html>
