<h1 class="title">PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Amos 4:12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The relationship between God and man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God is the creator of man, and God is man&rsquo;s ruler.</li>
	<li>We live and move in Him, and we shall be judged by God. This paragraph is to show that our living is related to God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man shall meet God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Today man doesn&rsquo;t feel that he is related to God. You should portray man&rsquo;s condition of dumbness and dullness toward God. Man is insensitive to God and does not care for God.</li>
	<li>Each one will have to leave this world one day. When a man dies, his present life is finished, and eternity begins. When a man enters eternity, he shall meet God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When a man meets God, he shall be judged by God.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s judgment is according to a man&rsquo;s work.</li>
	<li>No man&rsquo;s work can meet the standard of God&rsquo;s judgment.</li>
	<li>Hence, the result of God&rsquo;s judgment is that man will be condemned to perish.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to prepare to meet God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Repent and turn to God.</li>
	<li>Confess and forsake your sins.</li>
	<li>Believe and receive Christ and His redemption.</li>
	<li>Serve God.</li>
	</ol></li>
