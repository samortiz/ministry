   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Offering Up Our Money Being a Great Deliverance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Chi Yung-tung testified: After I heard Brother Nee's words, untold tears were flowing within me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was brought into the responsibility of the work through our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I left my job in 1928, I had five children, and I was in debt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But what the Lord has given me today is so much richer than what I had.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord is responsible for meeting His demands, because whatever comes from God, God Himself will be responsible for fulfilling it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was once a rich man, and I encountered robbers four times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These robbers were not only after money; they were after our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They tried purposely to kill the landlords and the capitalists.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had killed over thirty people out of forty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These facts are for our warning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is good for Christians to be neither rich nor poor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Money makes a person proud, and consecration is a great deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must not miss the Lord's command today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Scripture Reading: Rom 12:1-2, 4; Acts 2:44-46; 4:32-35; 5:12-14 MONEY AND THE SERVICE IN THE BODY Consecrating Everything for the Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>of Serving in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Witness Lee's fellowship:Romans 12 speaks in a strong way of the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The consecration there is for service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This service is a service in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not individual service, but service in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a man is not in the Body, it is difficult for him to understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am afraid some people will misunderstand what we are doing here during the past few days and will think that we are rallying a fund-raising campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you understand things in this way, you are off.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have received God's grace to serve Him in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to do that, we have to offer up everything and put everything in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to be coordinated in our work and in our jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for God to take the fast way, and in order for the work to reach a high standard, we must have such a kind of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Where Riches Are, There Being Our Person Also</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why do we have to touch the matter of riches?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is because the Lord says, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where your heart is, there will be your very person also.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Riches are like a nail; they nail a person down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps in these few days, some nails have loosened up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But they have not fallen down yet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Deliverance from Riches Being the Practical Way</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>to Offer Up Our Bodies</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first time God did such a work was in Acts 2.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There the saved ones were delivered from riches on the first day vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>44-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet today, every one of us is still under the tight grip of riches; they are still nailing us down.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May God deliver every one of us from riches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 12 speaks of two bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One is our own body, and the other is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We offer up our bodies for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a man has not been delivered from riches, he cannot offer up his body to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The most powerful testimony in God's recovery is the testimony of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to have the Body service, a man must offer up his own body as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Being Delivered from Money to Serve in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Acts 2 and 4 show us that as soon as money goes out, there is the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the disciples took care of the problem of money, the one accord followed, and God's work was realized in a marvelous way in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The book of Acts is our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first time God saved men, He saved them in great numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All those men were delivered from riches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Their service was carried out in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This service in one accord is the Body service spoken of in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Dealing with Money to Have the Body Service</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If a Christian has not been terminated by God with respect to money, he cannot serve the Lord along with other members.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Even if he is to serve, his service will be a superficial one and will not be one that issues from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One of the greatest obstacles to our consecration is the matter of riches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And one of the greatest enemies in the Body of Christ is individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Acts, no one said that anything was his own.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you say that this money is yours, it will be difficult for you to be delivered from individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The strongest manifestation of individualism is in the matter of money.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our way, our work, and our testimony in the future lie with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the question of money is not settled, we cannot expect to have good coordination, and we cannot expect that we can serve God.</S>
