[1]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE CONTENT OF CHRISTIAN MEETINGS THE EFFECT OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL
[2]  From our observation of the new ones coming to the Lord s table meeting, we found that the sweetest part is the fellowship with some light refreshments after the meeting.
[3]  The new ones often come to the meetings joyfully, but it seems that we all forget our sense of duty.
[4]  The above matters show us that if we all in various places only go knocking on doors, leading people to be baptized and establishing home meetings, yet we do not have the proper spiritual content in the meetings, there will be a great deficiency.
[5]  We need to pay attention to leading the new ones to confess their sins before the Lord.
[6]  In the meetings we have heard many testimonies about how people were saved, but we have not often heard someone testify that he felt he was sinful, that he had confessed his sins before the Lord, and that he believed that the precious blood of the Lord Jesus shed on the cross for him had cleansed away all his sins.
[7]  Therefore, when we contact new believers, whether before or after their baptism, we should have some good fellowship with them on the matter of sin so that they may have a proper feeling toward sin.
[8]  In the past we baptized people, but we could not keep them because we did not have the home meetings, and we did not know how to practice the home meetings.
[9]  IN LEADING HOME MEETINGS THE FLOCKING NATURE CREATED BY GOD FOR MAN
[10]  The home meetings are according to the longing of man.
[11]  On the one hand, there is a desire within man, but on the other hand, many are not willing to pay the price to practically achieve this desire.
[12]  In order to have home meetings, everyone has to be busy and diligent, and everyone needs to labor.
[13]  IN THE HOME MEETINGS Allowing the Lord to Increase,
[14]  In order to deal with difficult situations in the home meeting, we first need to be respectable persons, persons highly regarded by others.
[15]  Even though the host of a home meeting may be a successful, famous, retired person over sixty years old, when we go to his home to lead the home meeting, we need to have his high appraisal as we stand or sit before him.
[16]  Even before we speak, by our expression, appearance, and posture, people may realize that we are persons with weight.
[17]  Furthermore, we need to let the truth, the words given to us by the Lord in the Bible, sanctify us John 17:17 .
[18]  The Lord s own word tells us that the truth can sanctify us.
[19]  When we pursue life, grow in life, experience restrictions, and are regulated by the law of the Lord within us, and at the same time we study the Bible, pursue the truth, and are enlightened by it, the concepts within us are unconsciously and completely changed.
[20]  AN INCREASE IN THE CHURCH STRENGTHENING THE HOME MEETINGS,
[21]  Recently a brother from England brought us a copy of the statistics of the whole of Christianity in England.
[22]  The reason for the decline in Christianity is that people have taken the way of chance.
[23]  THE PANORAMIC VIEW OF GOSPELIZING TAIWAN The Full-timers Working Diligently in One Accord
[24]  After two terms of the full-time training, there will be two hundred fifty full-timers.
[25]  After they complete their training, they will have some time off for rest.
[26]  For example, we can first minister on the Lord s life and His precious blood, then on God s love, and third on God s grace.
[27]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE GOAL OF THE HOME MEETINGS 1 LEADING THE NEW ONES
[28]  Through our practical experience we can say that gaining the new ones by door-knocking is not a difficult matter.
[29]  They may know a little about drawing near to the Lord and praying to the Lord, yet they do not know that the One who dwells in them is the Triune God.
[30]  Although He is God and is life, if He had not passed through many processes, He could not be our life and He would not be able to dwell in us.
[31]  Afterward, He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.
[32]  He first lived in a poor carpenter s family in Nazareth for thirty years.
[33]  Moreover, this God is also in them, so they can fellowship with such a One in life in their daily living not only when we are there but even when we are not.
[34]  It is our burden to lead the newly saved ones to enter into this experience.
[35]  However, we must also note that not every home is suitable for this.
[36]  For those who have reached this stage, we need to bring them into the experience of fellowshipping with the Lord.
[37]  If we want to bring people into fellowship with the Lord in life, we first need to lead them to be filled with life and to have the experience of the filling of the Holy Spirit.
[38]  If we do not confess our sins thoroughly, it is very difficult for the Holy Spirit to have the ground in us, and we are not able to receive the co-death with Christ on the cross.
[39]  After we have confessed our sins, we have peace within because how many sins we have confessed is how much God has forgiven us, and how many sins we have confessed is how much the precious blood of the Lord Jesus has cleansed us.
[40]  How much we confess is how much God forgives, how deeply we confess is how deeply God forgives, and how broadly we confess is how broadly God forgives.
[41]  As we believe the forgiveness of God and receive the cleansing of the Lord s blood, we have peace within, and we also have the inward filling of the Holy Spirit.
[42]  Colossians 1:27-29 says, To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory, whom we announce, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.
[43]  The Lord s recovery among us already has a history of over sixty years.
[44]  In the beginning our scale was very small, the situation was very difficult, and what the Lord had shown us was very limited.
[45]  Gradually, however, over the last sixty years we cannot say that we saw something new every day, but we certainly have seen something new each year.
[46]  Prior to October of 1984, we practiced the truth, preached the gospel, established churches, and lived the church life.
[47]  However, that view and that realm were not broad enough, causing us to suffer a great loss.
[48]  Due to the damage caused by the poison of the practice in Christianity of one man speaking and all others listening, the Lord s recovery has not propagated and expanded much for many years.
[49]  Before she was saved, a certain young sister was injured by someone, so she called some drug dealers to go to that person s home to deal with him.
[50]  However, please bear in mind that the saints themselves must first be trained, and the localities where the saints are must be in one accord, or if a certain locality does not have a church, there must be three to five there who are in one accord.
[51]  In short, we should all the more spread the truth and not neglect it.
[52]  Here is a big problem, to which we all must pay attention.
[53]  In our propagation we cannot be blind and limit ourselves to only one way.
[54]  However, although the situations may be different, we must be absolutely one in believing in the Bible, the Triune God, Jesus Christ, the need to receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Lord, the uniqueness of the Body of Christ, and the oneness of the expression of the Body in the different local churches.
[55]  On man s side, the faith is the belief that we must be saved by the forgiveness of sins and regenerated to have God s life, that Christ has only one Body, and that the expression of this one Body in every locality is also one.
[56]  The second passage is 2 Corinthians 4:1, 2 and 5, which says, Therefore having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart; but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God....For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake.
[57]  In these passages of the Scriptures, Paul shows us not only the mystery of God hidden throughout the ages but also the all-inclusive Christ.
[58]  A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK IN THE UNITED STATES
[59]  Although there is a general preaching of the gospel, there is no gospel concerning the hidden mystery or the high gospel concerning Christ in us.
[60]  It is no easy task to open up a wasteland, but it is an indisputable fact that there are millions of people scattered in every major continent of the world, waiting for people to save their souls.
[61]  It is a glorious matter for us to go out for the Lord.
[62]  Although we are not the ones who sowed, the Lord has already sown through others, so all we need to do is to reap.
[63]  We should not be afraid of hardships when we serve in each locality, because we have the treasure.
[64]  If we add to the treasure our labor and struggle, I believe that the whole earth will be ours.
[65]  After being gained by the Lord, a certain brother of Jewish descent traveled not only throughout the United States but also to Taiwan.
[66]  What we need now is not to live a life in paradise but rather to go to various localities to labor, struggle, work the mystery of God into others, and let the mystery of Christ shine forth.
[67]  It is a great mercy given to us by the Lord that not only do we not adulterate the word of God, but we also release and strengthen the word of God.
[68]  The Lord not only reveals to us the mystery of God but also shows us that this mystery is both on the Lord s side and on ours.
[69]  OF THE NEW COVENANT THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT
[70]  Second Corinthians 3:6 says, Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the letter but of the Spirit.
[71]  If we have no ordinances or rituals, yet we still live a life that is higher than others , this will prove that we are not of the letter but of life and of the Spirit.
[72]  When we conduct a home meeting, the first impression that people in the home obtain from us is not what message we speak or how we teach them but what kind of person we are.
[73]  Their first impression is whether we are light persons or weighty persons, whether we are loose or grave.
[74]  The Bible tells us that as those who serve the Lord, elders and deacons should have the same kind of character, one which is grave 1 Tim 3:2-4, 8 .
[75]  If our life is light and flighty, it is because we do not have enough of God within us.
[76]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says, But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[77]  Just as the love of God means that God and love are one, and the life of God means that God and life are one, the ministry of the Spirit means that the Spirit and the ministry are one.
[78]  Our being spiritual and our work becoming spirit depend on how much we know the mystery of God.
[79]  Therefore, the extent to which we know and experience Christ as the mystery of God is the extent to which we are spiritual.
[80]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY THE GLORY OF THE MYSTERY OF GOD
[81]  God had a mystery that even the angels did not know.
[82]  Then He called the apostles and prophets and revealed the mystery to them v. 5 . Since this was done in the New Testament age, it is called the New Testament economy.
[83]  However, after God became flesh, lived on the earth, chose the apostles, went to the cross to die, resurrected, ascended, and accomplished this mystery, He sent His apostles to the lands of the Gentiles to bring this mystery to them.
[84]  Whether or not the Lord can come back depends not merely on our going door-knocking but on how much we know Him inwardly, how much glory He has within us, and how much we have enjoyed His riches.
[85]  In Colossians 1:28 Paul continues to say, Whom we announce...in all wisdom.
[86]  We need to learn to exercise not only one kind of wisdom but all wisdom, which includes various kinds of wisdom.
[87]  In the practice of the new way in the church we do not want oldness, but we also need to exercise all wisdom.
[88]  Ephesians 3:8 says, To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel.
[89]  Paul said that the Lord gave him grace, and this grace enabled him to struggle and minister Christ to others.
[90]  God gave this grace to Paul so that he could announce the unsearchable riches of Christ, the riches he had seen and experienced, as the gospel.
[91]  If we know this mystery and also see what this mystery is in God s hand, in His mind, and in His wise arrangement, economy, plan, and administration, it will occupy our whole life.
[92]  God gave Paul the grace to do two things: first, to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel, and second, to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things v. 9 . This is the commission and charge Paul received through the grace of God.
[93]  This chapter does not say that man is sinful, that the Lord Jesus died for man, and that if we believe in Him, we will have joy and peace.
[94]  This is because the gospel in Christianity always begins from the sinners side, saying that we are sinners who deserve to perish, that all kinds of disasters and sufferings are upon us today because we are sinful, and that we should repent.
[95]  On the whole, people mainly know the gospel of the forgiveness of sins, preaching only that man is sinful but that because of God s love Christ died for us to redeem us, and if we believe in Him, we will have peace, joy, and everlasting life.
[96]  This does not mean that we no longer acknowledge that we are sinners or that we do not acknowledge that the Lord Jesus died for us.
[97]  Chapter sixteen concludes by saying that the gospel of God is according to the mystery that has been hidden in eternity, that is, the mystery which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages v. 25 . Romans begins from man s sins in chapter one and ascends all the way to speak about the mystery hidden in the times of the ages.
[98]  If we are not living in the church, this mystery also has very little to do with us practically; the church is the church, and we are we, and there is not much connection between the two.
[99]  Today when He as the mystery comes into us, He becomes a mystery in us.
[100]  Therefore, when we say that man was created by God according to His own image, we mean that man was created by God according to Christ.
[101]  After four thousand years, many things had happened among mankind, but this mystery was still in God and had not yet entered into man.
[102]  It was when God Himself was incarnated and entered into man that He became the mystery in man.
[103]  May we not only hear this, but may we also see the video that the mystery in God one day became the mystery in Jesus Christ, who is in us today and has become our hope of glory.
[104]  Paul said, Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He God who was manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .
[105]  When we speak Christ to our parents, they may want to know the details of this mystery.
[106]  The more we try to answer them, though, the more easily we fall into a trap and the more they will not understand.
[107]  In the beginning, the mystery that was in God was kept in silence, and today it is hard for us to break the silence.
[108]  AND THE MEANING OF TRAINING TO SERVE THE LORD
[109]  If we want to work for the Lord, we must learn continually.
[110]  The Lord s work requires not only one person with a Ph.D. but many, who know astronomy, geography, business, economics, and other subjects, because all these are related to human living.
[111]  In the Chinese educational system, economics is an all-inclusive subject, but the Lord s work is even more inclusive than economics.
[112]  God s economy is God s plan, and this plan, this intention, is for the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to dispense Himself into man step by step to be man s life and be lived out from him in order to gain corporate sons who are constituted to be the Body of Christ, which appears in each locality as the local churches in which we, the members of the Body, serve the Lord.
[113]  Paul also said that he was appointed to be a teacher of the Gentiles 2:7 .
[114]  First and 2 Timothy speak about the training a person must receive in order to serve God.
[115]  Although these two books are short, the points that they cover encompass the entire content of God s economy.
[116]  The second item we need to exercise is to call on the name of the Lord.
[117]  Whereas to pray is to ask or tell something to the Lord, calling is simply to breathe.
[118]  If we live by ourselves, what we live out will definitely not be God, but if we live by the life of God, what we live out will be God.
[119]  The sixth item of exercise is to be empowered in the grace of Christ 2 Tim 2:1 .
[120]  We all know that the grace of Christ is Christ Himself.
[121]  The expression the grace of Christ is simple, but its meaning is broad and profound.
[122]  Christ is the embodiment of God, and grace is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His embodiment into us as our enjoyment.
[123]  According to the grammar of the Greek New Testament, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ means that Jesus Christ is grace, the love of God means that God is love, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit means that the Holy Spirit is fellowship.
[124]  Without the Holy Spirit there is no fellowship, without God there is no love, and without Jesus Christ there is no grace.
[125]  We do not merely read the word of God, but we read the word of God by means of prayer, that is, we pray-read the word of God.
[126]  Although we have much spiritual deposit within us God, the Lord, and the word if we do not rely on the indwelling Holy Spirit but walk according to our will, this inward deposit will be nullified.
[127]  Today many Christians not only do not know how to preach God s economy, but they do not know what God s economy is.
[128]  The Divine Trinity has a divine dispensing, and what He dispenses into us is the Triune God Himself as our life to regenerate us, sanctify us, and transform us so that we may be conformed to the image of His firstborn Son and become God s many sons.
[129]  Without the washing of feet, they say, there is no love for one another, and without loving one another we do not appear to be the Lord s disciples and thus are not worthy to partake of the Lord s supper.
[130]  CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE FELLOWSHIP ON STAYING IN TAIPEI OR RETURNING TO THE RESPECTIVE LOCALITIES
[131]  In August of 1986 we held the first term of the full-time training in Taipei.
[132]  The main purpose of the training is to perfect the trainees to take the new way, to bring sinners to the Lord that they may repent and be saved, and to continue to take care of them.
[133]  At this time there are about eight thousand five hundred new ones under our care, and we have meetings in their homes.
[134]  Question: For those of us who want to stay, should we fellowship with our respective localities by phone or mail, or should we return to our localities to fellowship with them?
[135]  When we say that we need to receive the one leading, it does not mean that we receive the leading of a certain person but that we receive the leading of the Lord s move.
