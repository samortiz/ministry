<p>After we have seen the central vision, we must practice to live in it. Since the Lord is in us, our living must be one with Him. We must flee our routine, disposition, culture, religious knowledge, and godly accomplishments. In Hebrews 6:18 the apostle speaks of fleeing for refuge because Satan goes to great lengths to keep us from living one with the Lord, and he can use anything, even the Bible, our spiritual gifts, and our life experiences, to keep us from living one with the Lord. We should be those who flee from our routine and disposition and from our formal prayers, godly spiritual experiences, and scholarly accomplishments. We must flee and not let Satan use these things to hold us back. We may not be able to immediately distance ourselves from these things, but it does not matter. The only thing that matters is seeing the vision and determining to take this way. If we do this, we will flee from the old things in our being little by little until they are no longer a part of our living.</p>
<p>Brother Watchman Nee once said, &ldquo;The discovery of God&rsquo;s truth is progressive; the more it advances, the more complete it becomes&rdquo; (<em>God&rsquo;s Overcomers,</em> p. 138). Because there is a progressive discovery of God&rsquo;s truth, &ldquo;changes&rdquo; are not shameful, and it is only natural that we would change. When we see more, we will change yet again. The extent to which we see the many revelations in the Bible is the extent to which we will change. The more we see, the more we will live by Christ and the more we will change. The way among us is a way of change, but there are no set forms or regulations. In taking the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today, our ground cannot change and our fundamental beliefs cannot change, but the way forward will change. The more we see, the more we will change and go forward. We cannot adhere to the old, but neither should we rely on new tricks. We should not be limited by anything that we have come to know or experience; rather, we should live and walk by the Lord in our spirit in order to receive His moment-by-moment leading.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIPPING WITH OTHERS TO FLEE INDIVIDUALITY</h2>
<p>In addition, we should fellowship with one another in order to go on together, never depending on any one person. In the co-workers&rsquo; meeting I have noticed that there is not much fellowship in spirit, but there is much talk related to right and wrong. This results in a great loss of blessing. If we do not fellowship with one another in our living, in our work for the Lord, and in our supplying of the church, we are making a grave mistake. If the saints cannot fellowship with one another, they will be defeated, even devoured, by Satan. In order for us to escape Satan&rsquo;s devouring, we must fellowship. We cannot live and work without fellowship. There must be fellowship for the leading of the church. The ones bearing the yoke together must have fellowship. The Lord&rsquo;s testimony in the West is under the blessing because the saints, regardless of how long they have been saved, have no desire for anything old, and they have opened their spirits to fellowship.</p>
<p>In the church in Los Angeles no one knows what will happen tomorrow, but there is fellowship every day. Through fellowship many new things have been opened up. We must have fellowship. If those who are serving here cannot get through in this matter, we will have problems. Everyone who is involved in the coordination of the service should be in the fellowship. Any lack of fellowship is an indication that we have fallen into Satan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>According to my observation, there has been more accusation and condemnation than fellowship among the co-workers here. Nevertheless, we are polite and do not make a scene even though we are divided from one another. As a result, there is a subtle condemning attitude among us, and this prevents us from having fellowship in spirit with one another. Instead, we are rigid in our ways, and we act according to our own view and will. Thus, there is no blessing from the Lord. No matter how much an individual can do, everything depends on the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. A farmer can till, water, and prune, but the growth of his crops depends on whether God sends the rain and protects them from natural disasters. If God does not send rain and protect the crops, what can a farmer do? No matter how much we can do, everything depends on the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. Thus, we should serve and fellowship together in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no opinion when I am with the saints in the church in Los Angeles. There are many different views, but everyone is in fellowship in order to touch the sense in the spirit. We have no opinion about how the Lord should lead or about His ultimate direction. No one knows what will happen when we gather for fellowship. When the Lord moves in our fellowship, we simply follow, and there is much blessing. He sends the rain and covers us, and sweet fruit is produced. If we do not fellowship, we will suffer loss from a &ldquo;plague of locusts&rdquo; that will eat up our work and leave us with little result.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
