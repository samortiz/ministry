   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXAMPLES OF SPEAKING DIFFERENTLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>About ten years ago in Taiwan a very spiritual brother with a high spiritual ministry came among us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We respected him very much, and we honored his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we received much help from him, we arranged a meeting with him and about one hundred young co-workers, most of whom were under my training.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While we were fellowshipping, he suddenly said, I am disappointed with the way you have your Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In his opinion we should have had one person to preside over the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He said, You are too loose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everyone behaves according to his or her feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I was surprised and dismayed by this speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I had invited him there to help the work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If he had seen something that was not fitting, the best and most proper way to deal with it would have been to speak privately about it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Later I was invited to his place of meeting, and I stayed there for four weeks, attending the Lord s table meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He stood up to begin the meeting, and he announced the hymn, offered a prayer, read the Bible, and spoke a word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then he offered a blessing for the bread, called for the deacons, and passed one plate to each of them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the deacons took the plates to the attendants, everyone held the bread in their hand and waited.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Finally he himself picked up a piece of the bread and said, Now let us eat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then he offered another blessing for the cup in the same way, passed the trays of cups to the deacons, and again everyone waited until he took a cup and said, Now let us drink.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After he offered another prayer, a time of public worship began in which certain others prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After about ten minutes he announced, Now the public worship is over.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When this brother was among us, he told us that he was disappointed with our table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I would have spoken in the same way, I too would have said that I was very disappointed with his meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, we all practice the Lord s table meeting in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Taiwan the churches practice one way, and in other places others practice in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot say absolutely which is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may also use baptism to illustrate the problem of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all practice baptism, but some baptize by immersion, some by sprinkling, and some even baptize by waving a flag over people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A brother from Manila once asked me what words we speak when we baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He told me that one group insists on saying, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, but another group insists on saying, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These two groups contended with each other over this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This illustrates that simply in this one matter alone there are many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some brothers among us baptize without saying much; they only say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other places the brothers baptize in the name of the Lord, in the name of Christ, or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some brothers like to speak more, so they say, Brother, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God, or, I baptize you in the name of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All of these ways are good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In addition to contending over the name into which we baptize, others consider what kind of water to use.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some insist on baptizing in the sea, and others in the river, yet others baptize in a swimming pool.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, some argue about how many times to immerse people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some immerse once, but others immerse three times, once each for the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One brother strongly told me that we should not baptize in water at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He said that water baptism is dispensationally over and that today we need only the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Shortly afterward in another place, a sister stood up in the middle of my message and said, Tell me, do you baptize people with water?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without water baptism no one can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One says that water baptism is dispensationally over, but another says that without it no one can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The issues affecting the oneness among the Lord s children seem endless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>NOT ADJUSTING A CHURCH IN ANOTHER LOCALITY BUT GOING ALONG WITH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>AND MINISTERING THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to learn the lessons from history.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to history, all the denominations arose because someone began to stress a particular teaching or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the reason why in almost every city today there are many different denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The practice of different churches, what is emphasized in them, and their outstanding features may even be according to the natural disposition of the leading ones there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a local church has been raised up under a certain kind of practice, we should be wise and not speak differently against its practice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some may ask, What then shall I do?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems that I can do nothing there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are many things we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can go along with the church to preach the gospel and bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can help the saints to know the Lord more in life and in the spirit without referring to particular practices or bringing in our own practice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we also can pray and wait.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At a certain time the Lord may open the way to speak about a certain practice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Still, we should not stress it, and we should always be watchful as to whether or not our speaking will cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If our speaking causes trouble, we must stay silent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Otherwise, we can try to minister something in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In my ministry I often tell people that man is a trichotomy, a person of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, in a local church that meets on the proper ground, the brothers and sisters may have been raised up under a ministry that teaches dichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If I go to such a church, by the Lord s mercy and grace I will not speak a word about trichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I will simply go along with the church in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I will simply say, Brothers, we need to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have been regenerated in our spirit, so now we have to contact the Lord by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some may come to me and ask, What about the difference between the spirit and soul?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, due to the atmosphere in that church I would say only, Brothers, forget about this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As long as we love the Lord and honor Him, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I can still do many things to help the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If I have the measure and the stature, I can minister the riches of Christ to the saints without mentioning trichotomy and, even the more, without opposing dichotomy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As long as the saints in a certain place are one in the Lord s life and in the church as His expression, they are the church on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We must recognize this fact, and we must respect their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we go to them openly or even privately to tell them that dichotomy is incorrect and to show them trichotomy in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We may be right doctrinally, but we are wrong practically, and we will damage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have been in the United States for more than three years, and I have visited many places.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>By the Lord s mercy, I did not correct, adjust, make proposals, or speak differently from them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even when some have asked me to speak about a certain matter, I simply ministered something of Christ positively to help the church to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This does not mean that I agree with all the practices in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If a certain church were under my hand, its practice might be completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If the car were in my hand, I would drive it in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, it is not my car, so I should not be a backseat driver.</S>
