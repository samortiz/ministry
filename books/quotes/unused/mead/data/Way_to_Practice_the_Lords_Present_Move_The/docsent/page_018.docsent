   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having Everything in Common</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the very beginning of the church life recorded in the book of Acts, the saints were, no doubt, under the Holy Spirit s move.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the day of Pentecost at least over three thousand saints were touched by the Lord to have everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was only practiced for a short time at the initiation of God s New Testament economy; it did not continue for the long run as a practice of legality in the church life during Paul s ministry, as proven by his words in 2 Corinthians 9 and other places.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The practice to have all things in common could not go on too long because there are many practical things involved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Acts 6:1 shows us that the distribution of food among them became a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even under the move of the Holy Spirit, to practice having everything in common was hard.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Testament shows us that this way did not last very long.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually the full moon of having everything in common waned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Acts 20:34 Paul told us that he worked to take care of his needs and to take care of the ones who were with him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If everything were still in common by that time, there would have been no need for Paul to work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse in Acts 20 shows that by that time having everything in common was over.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1943 there was a great revival in the church in Chefoo, my hometown in China.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Over the course of a one-hundred-day period, everyone donated nearly everything he owned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some saints dared not to look at anything in their home when they returned after the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever they looked at, there was the urge within to give it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The saints offering of everything eventually became a big problem to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nearly all the possessions of the approximately eight hundred saints in the church in Chefoo were offered to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we wondered how all the saints were going to live.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I looked to the Lord very much and considered what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I realized that I and the church could not bear such a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seemed that the best way was for the church to keep a small part of the offerings and return the rest to the saints, telling them that from now on they should not use anything for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They must use everything for the Lord, but their possessions must still be in their hands and not in the church s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was through this offering that seventy saints, including husbands, wives, and children, were sent to inner Mongolia from Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church supported them, giving them enough material supply to live in inner Mongolia for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These seventy were all sent at the same time on one boat.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Another thirty were sent to the city of Antung in Manchuria with the church supplying their daily needs for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Other Christian groups throughout the course of church history also tried to practice having everything in common, but no one has succeeded.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What happened on the day of Pentecost with the believers having all things common was wonderful but temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have seen that later Aquila had a job and Paul, a full-time worker, worked with him in the same trade.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must realize though that the principle of having all things common still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It does not remain in the way practiced in Acts 2 and 4, but in the way practiced by Paul in Acts and taught by him in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Principle of Equality</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 2 Corinthians 8:12-15 Paul says we must give willingly according to what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who gathered much will have no excess, and those who gathered little will have no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The result of such giving and receiving is what Paul calls equality v. 14 . Equality equals having everything common, but there are different means of practicing this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is an old proverb which says, There has never been a rich family that has lasted for three generations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every rich man wants his riches to last forever, but God is sovereign to balance the social wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have seen rich people whose grandchildren become poor and poor people whose grandchildren became rich.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have also seen rich Christians who loved the Lord in a sense, but they loved money more.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Money was much greater and more important to them than God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They saved a lot of money for their grandchildren, but eventually all their grandchildren became poor mainly by squandering their riches nonsensically.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is hard to see a second generation among Christians who kept the riches of the first generation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is sovereign to balance the social wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you want to make much money and retain it for your children and grandchildren, the end result will be a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The best way for us to train our children is to tell them that we only give them three kinds of assets: the Lord Jesus with His salvation, education, and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These are the only three things we should bequeath to our children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let them inherit these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Concerning other things, it is best not to give them too much; otherwise, you will corrupt and damage them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must remember that God s principle is to have equality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even in the Old Testament there is the divine way to balance the social wealth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>None of the Jews could sell their property forever.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the most, they could only sell it for fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the year of jubilee everything was returned to the original owner Lev 25:8-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s way is to keep equality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In practice this is more practical than having everything common.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Having everything common will cause many practical problems.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The principle we keep is the principle of equality in 2 Corinthians 8.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is just like the receiving of manna in the Old Testament Exo 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you receive more, God will sovereignly arrange for you to have no excess.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you receive less, by God s sovereignty you will have no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The manna that some of the children of Israel tried to save so they could have some excess bred worms and stank Exo 16:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the principle of equality.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some may feel that since God keeps equality and that we will never lack anything, that there is then no need for them to do any work.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul, however charged the saints in Thessalonica that if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat 2 Thes 3:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A person should eat his own food 3:12 and should not be burdensome to others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This means that a person should go to work and not look to others to support him.</S>
