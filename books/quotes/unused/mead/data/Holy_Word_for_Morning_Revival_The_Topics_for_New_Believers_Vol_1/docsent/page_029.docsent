   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 5 DAY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Cor 7:1 Beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prov 28:13 He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Dealing with Sins</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Dealing" implies that we follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to purge away all the difficulties which hinder the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we have consecrated ourselves to God that He may use us, God must cleanse us, deal with us, and purge away all our problems so that we may be fit for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we wish to use a glass, we would first want it to be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When it is completely clean, it is a glass which we can use.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before we consecrate ourselves, or when we depart from a consecrated position, we do not realize that we need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, if we desire to fulfill the purpose of our consecration, we need to have all our difficulties dealt with one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among all the difficulties which need to be dealt with, sins are the crudest, the most defiling, and the most evident.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After having consecrated ourselves, the first thing we need to deal with is sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Scriptural Basis</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The following references give the scriptural basis for dealing with sins: Matthew 5:23-26.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here, "reconciled" and "be well disposed toward" refer to dealings concerning our relationships with others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then in 2 Corinthians 7:1 "cleanse" also refers to a kind of dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Similarly, in 1 John 1:9 "confess" is again a kind of dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, in Proverbs 28:13 "confesses" and "forsakes" speak also of a dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We see from the above scriptures how we are to deal with sins: towards men, we must be reconciled with them and be well disposed toward them; towards God, we must confess our sins; and concerning sin, we must forsake it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These kinds of settlement of sin are what we mean by dealing with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Object of Our Dealing with Sins</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The object of our dealing with sins is the sins themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are two aspects with regard to sin: the nature of sin within and the action of sin without.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The dealing with sins of which we are speaking is our dealing with the sins which we commit outwardly, the sins in our actions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What are the sins in our actions?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First John 5:17 says, "All unrighteousness is sin."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First John 3:4 says, "Sin is lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both references show that in our actions all acts of unrighteousness and lawlessness are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 2:14-15 says that those of the nations which have no law are a law to themselves; they show the work of the law written in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their conscience is the law within them which bears witness, and their thoughts either accuse or else excuse them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All deeds which are right and lawful are justified by our conscience; all deeds which are not right and lawful are condemned by our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All actions, therefore, that are contrary to our conscience are actions of sins and the object of our dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The external action of sins has two aspects: the record of sin and the fact of sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The record of sin denotes the unrighteous and lawless deeds which offend the righteous law of God and result in our having a record of sin before the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the future, God will judge us according to this record.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fact of sinning is the very act which establishes the record of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These sinful acts always fall short of the glory of God and, in either a perceptible or an imperceptible manner, hurt others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example: stealing is an act of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By so doing, not only do we put the name of God to shame, but we also cause damage to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This constitutes the fact of sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, we have offended the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Henceforth, before His law we have a record of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On one hand we need to deal with our record of sin before God, and on the other hand we need to deal with the fact of our sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>102</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
