<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">FINDING AND SERVING CHRIST OUTSIDE RELIGION</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the birth of the Lord was outside religion. His birth had nothing to do with religious matters, people, places, or ordinances. His birth was entirely of the Spirit. Therefore, He can save His people from their sins (Matt. 1:21). Moreover, since His birth was entirely of the Spirit, He is Emmanuel, meaning &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; (v. 23).</p>
<p>When we fall into religion, we lose the saving power of Jesus, and we also lose Emmanuel&mdash;we lose God&rsquo;s presence. Both Jesus&rsquo; saving power and God&rsquo;s presence are in the Holy Spirit, not in religion. We should never think that we can touch Jesus&rsquo; saving power or have God&rsquo;s presence in religion. We need to be outside religion and in the Holy Spirit in order to receive the saving power of Jesus and enjoy the presence of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STAR OF CHRIST APPEARING TO THE GENTILE MAGI</h2>
<p>Matthew 2:1-12 shows the kind of people who are able to find and serve the Lord. The Lord was born outside religion, and He is found and served by people outside religion.</p>
<p>It is marvelous that although the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, His star appeared to the Gentile magi. The magi, who were in a heathen land, saw the star, but no one in Jerusalem or Judea saw it. None of the people who were in the realm of religion saw the star. The scribes and the chief priests were people with the equivalent of doctorate degrees in the Holy Scriptures. They knew the Scriptures well, and they understood the Scriptures. They taught people the Scriptures daily. However, the star of Christ did not appear to them. The Gentile magi did not understand anything of the Bible, and it is likely that they did not even have a copy of the Scriptures, but they saw the star of Christ. This is marvelous. Our Lord was born in Bethlehem, but His star appeared to Gentiles who lived far away in a heathen land.</p>
<p>Numbers 24:17 says, &ldquo;There shall come forth a Star out of Jacob.&rdquo; <em>Jacob</em> is another name for Israel, and it is also another name for the people of Israel. The Lord is the Star out of Jacob, but He did not show this star to the people of Israel, because at that time the people of Israel were in religion. The Lord as the star appeared to the Gentiles. The Gentile magi had heathen knowledge only. They did not have any religious knowledge, but the star appeared to them and was seen by them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NATURAL CONCEPTS CAUSING US<br />
TO LOSE THE LEADING OF THE STAR</h2>
<p>It is wonderful that the Gentile magi saw the star of Christ. However, they committed a common human mistake: they had natural concepts. When they realized that the star signified the King of the Jews, they followed their natural concept. They did not have religious knowledge or ordinances, but they had a natural concept. Natural concepts hinder us from knowing the Lord much more than our religious knowledge hinders us.</p>
<p>The magi did not have religious knowledge, but they had natural concepts. They exercised their mind and reasoned that the King of the Jews would be born in Jerusalem, the capital of the kingdom of the Jews. Based on this concept, they went to Jerusalem (Matt. 2:1-2), and the star disappeared. The star appeared to them because they did not have religious knowledge; the star disappeared because they had a natural concept. Religious knowledge and natural concepts are two dreadful things that cause us to lose the Lord&rsquo;s revelation.</p>
<p>When the magi arrived in Jerusalem, King Herod was very troubled and all Jerusalem with him (v. 3). King Herod gathered all the chief priests and scribes and inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. The chief priests and scribes were familiar with the Bible. They were bona fide religionists and Bible teachers. They replied, &ldquo;In Bethlehem of Judea&rdquo; (vv. 5-6; cf. Micah 5:2). The chief priests and scribes answered correctly because they knew the Bible. However, what they had was mere knowledge. They did not have revelation.</p>
<p>Not only so, the chief priests and scribes did not have a heart to seek after Christ. They heard that Christ, the King of the Jews, was born, and they knew that He was born in Bethlehem, but none of them went to find Christ. After they answered Herod, they went their own ways. This shows that Bible knowledge alone does not help us. This is the situation of many Christians today. They have Bible knowledge, but they do not have revelation, nor do they have a seeking heart.</p>
<p>After Herod found out the birthplace of Christ, He sent the magi to Bethlehem and said, &ldquo;Go and find out accurately about the child. And when you find Him, report to me, so that I also may come and worship Him&rdquo; (Matt. 2:8). Although Herod said this, he did not intend to worship Christ; rather, his intention was to harm Christ. Herod lied to deceive men, but he could not deceive God. God came in, and Herod discovered that he was mocked by the magi (vv. 12, 16).</p>
