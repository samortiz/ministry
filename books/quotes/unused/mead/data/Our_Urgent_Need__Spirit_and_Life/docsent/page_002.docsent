   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this small book and particularly in this chapter, we want to see what our urgent need is today.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a great matter for us to be created in the very image of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible shows us that the intention of God in making us in His image is to make us one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man as the creation of God is to be made one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's desire was for humanity to be made one with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not many Christians realize that God's intention is to make Himself one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When God makes us one with Him, He is making Himself one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is wonderful to have our sins forgiven and receive the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is wonderful to be regenerated with God, of God, and by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we must remember that God's intention in redemption and regeneration is that we and He would be joined together as one.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we have to ask how we could be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible shows us that God as a whole is Spirit John 4:24 , and it also refers to the Spirit of God Gen 1:2; Rom 8:9 .</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need the sixty-six books of the Bible to reveal the one Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, in the book of Revelation, this one Spirit becomes the seven Spirits 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's intention to make Himself one with us could only be accomplished by His being a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God were not a Spirit, there would be no way for Him to be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has to be a Spirit, and He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God became a man, and after He accomplished redemption on the cross as the Lamb of God, in His resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then when He comes to us as the third of the Trinity, He is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By being such a Spirit, He is capable of being one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the Lord Jesus, the incarnated God, died on the cross and entered into His resurrection, He came back to His disciples, breathed into them, and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not breathe the air for even a short period of time, we can die.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Triune God is like the omnipresent air to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is a wonderful, divine person mingled with humanity as the divine air for us to breathe in and enjoy.</S>
