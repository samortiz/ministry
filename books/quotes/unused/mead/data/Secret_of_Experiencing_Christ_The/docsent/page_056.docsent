   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we read the Bible in a proper way, especially when we pray-read it, we receive inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This inspiration is the moving of the living Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This moving of the Spirit is the function of the Spirit, and in the New Testament this function is called faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Faith is always intimately related to the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we read of faith in the New Testament, we should realize that both the Word and the Spirit are implied.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, Ephesians 3:17 says, "That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The phrase "through faith" implies the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same is true of Ephesians 2:8, which says that we are saved by grace through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The faith through which we are saved is the faith that implies the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Colossians 2:5 Paul speaks of "the firmness of your faith in Christ," and in verse 7, of "being established in the faith."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these verses also faith implies the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we did not have the Word, we could not have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, if we did not have the Word and the Spirit, there would be no way for us to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when we are filled with the Word, we are automatically filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we are spontaneously filled also with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was young, I often heard Christians talking about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I began to pray that the Lord would give me a strong faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the more I prayed for faith, the less faith I had.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Gradually I learned that the way to have faith is not just to pray for it, but to take in the Word in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By reading the Word again and again, my faith was strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brother Nee encouraged us to take a few verses every morning and repeat them and muse upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I did this, I found that I had faith spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As I look back on my experience, I realize that I had not only faith, but also the inner sense that I had been filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, from our experience we know that when we have the living Word in us, we also have the Spirit and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The four books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians all speak of the Word, the Spirit, and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Galatians, the emphasis is on faith; in Ephesians, on the Spirit; and in Colossians, on the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Philippians the emphasis is on all three.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to Galatians, faith comes from hearing the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although Ephesians strongly emphasizes the Spirit, the Spirit is mentioned only once in Colossians, in 1:8, where Paul speaks of the saints' love in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Philippians speaks of both the bountiful supply of the Spirit and also of the word of life 1:19; 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Ephesians the Word is called the word of God 6:17 ; in Philippians, the word of life; and in Colossians, the word of Christ 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Again and again I wish to point out the fact that apart from the Word we cannot have the Spirit or faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would enjoy Christ and experience Him, we must have the Spirit, and we must also have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without the Spirit, how can we experience Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And without faith, what way do we have to enjoy Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we would have the Spirit and the faith to experience Christ and enjoy Him, we must come to the Word again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Faith and the Spirit are found in no place other than the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we get into the Word, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Christian life is a life that is continually dealing with the divine Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Word must be before our eyes, in our spirit, in our heart, in our mind, in our mouth, and on our lips.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our whole being must be saturated with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Word is outside us, it is simply the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when the Word enters into us, it becomes the Spirit who gives us the faith to enjoy Christ and experience Him.</S>
