   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DELIVERANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regarding salvation we must believe that it is already done.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The same principle applies to healing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Deliverance is on the same basis.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must know that it is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was a man who was an elder of a church in a large city.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was very zealous for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He had three or four big stores.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He also supported the pastor in his church and preached with him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, this man had a very hot temper!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He came to me early one morning with tears in his eyes and said, "I am due to preach in church this morning, but I am afraid I cannot."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"What is your trouble?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I asked.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said, "You know I have an awful temper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I realize this, and I hate it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I know that I should not lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I confess and then lose my temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I tell all my employees about the Lord Jesus, and then I lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They say, What is the use of being a Christian?'</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have lost my temper in all of my stores, so I have lost my testimony too.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yesterday, I was very annoyed with some of my employees.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I managed to control myself even though I was very irritated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I thought, It is my turn to preach tomorrow, I dare not let my temper flare,' so I kept it under control until I got home.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was shaking all over with suppressed wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then I was irritated by happenings at home, but again I thought, It is my turn to preach tomorrow so I dare not flare up.'</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So I kept it all under control.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This morning when I got up, I recalled what had happened yesterday and shook all over at my remembrance of it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then my daughter did something to upset me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, to aggravate matters, my wife burned the food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After all that I said, This is beyond endurance; even if it is my turn to preach, I cannot keep this under control any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I cannot control myself, and I just cannot preach because I am about to burst!'</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now what about this?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I smiled, and he said, "Do not make fun of me."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said, "I feel very happy."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Why?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"I am rejoicing in another great case for the Lord," I said.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Do not think that my case is easy; my temper is beyond my control," he replied.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I said, "It may be too much for you, but it is not too much for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe in practical salvation, not in theoretical salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then I turned to Romans 8:2 and read, "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I asked him, "Are you in Christ Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Certainly I am," he replied.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"All right, then what does the Word of God say?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"The law of the Spirit...has freed me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I asked him, "What tense is used?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Past!" he exclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Yes, God says that the law of the Spirit of life has already made you free.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Are you free?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Of course not," he replied.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then I said, "I did not ask you whether or not you have lost your temper today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am asking whether or not you are free.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to the Word of God you are free because it says, has freed me.'"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He replied, "According to Romans 8:2 I am free, but according to my experience I am not free."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then I asked, "Are you going to believe in your experience or in God's Word?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Which is more reliable, God's Word or your experience?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He answered, "Of course, as a Christian I must say God's Word, but I cannot say that I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I said, "God does not so mind your temper as much as He minds your evil heart of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's Word says, The law of the Spirit of life has freed me.'</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you say that the Spirit has not freed you, you are saying that God's word in Romans 8:2 is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not mind your bad temper as much as I mind your evil heart of unbelief."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He said with tears, "I am convicted of unbelief, because I am hoping that I will be free but cannot believe that I am free.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I cannot believe the Word of God that I am already free."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I said, "This Sunday morning I have to speak; I must go and prepare.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am sorry that I cannot stay any longer, but I can let you have my sitting room.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You should deal with God about this sin of unbelief."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I came back a half hour later.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The brother gripped my hand and said, "Praise the Lord, hallelujah."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"What has happened?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I asked.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He responded, "Praise the Lord, I am free!"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I asked, "What about your temper?"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>"I only know this, I am free.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I care about nothing else because I am free," he replied.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then I asked, "Are you going to be free, or are you free now?"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"I am free now," was his reply.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As he went out the door, he said, "Praise the Lord, I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Two months later I met him and asked, "How are you now?"</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His answer was simply, "Praise the Lord, I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Four months later I met him again and asked the same question.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He still answered, "Praise the Lord, I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After six months he still had the same answer to my question.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Faith is not, "I will be free" or "God is able to make me free."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Faith is standing on the Word of God and saying, "I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>How can we have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must have our eyes opened.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is the most important point in regard to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We cannot just sit down and say, "I am saved; therefore, I am saved" or "I am healed; therefore, I am healed" or "I am free; therefore, I am free."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is auto-suggestion, not faith.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Instead, we need our eyes to be opened; we need revelation from the Word of God so that we can say, "God has heard my prayer, I know it!"</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We may not understand, but we know.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We may not be able to explain whether we heard a voice or saw a vision, etc., but we just know.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>How do we know?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We know; that is all.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>How do we know our name?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We just know it.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We do not need to go to a registry office to verify it or look in our passport once in a while to make sure.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We know.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Someone may say, "The Word of God says so."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is all right, but it may mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Yes, the Word of God says so, but do we know it?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we reason, "Since I have had a revelation, I have faith," and ask, "What should I do next?", then we have no faith!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Faith is spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Faith is: "Lord, I praise Your name; it is done."</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Praise is the natural outcome of faith, the spontaneous result of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We do not have to work it up.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Whenever there is faith, God honors it; whenever there is faith, there will be praise and prayer will cease.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We will say, "Thank You," and we will not plead.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>No one will need to urge us to praise because we cannot help but do so.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>May God teach us the true nature of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All prayer is heard on this basis.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Recorded by P.D.</S>
