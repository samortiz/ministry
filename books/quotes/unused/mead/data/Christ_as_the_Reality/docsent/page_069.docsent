   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS OUR PEACE OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 3:1-17; 7:11-21, 29-34; Num 10:10; Deut 27:7; Col 1:20-22a; Rom 5:1; Luke 15:23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The past fourteen chapters have been on the meal offering, and I do believe that by them the Lord has shown us something of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the above verses, it is clear that the presenter has to lay his hands upon the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"And if his present be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he present it of the herd, whether it be a male or female, he shall present it without blemish before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about" Lev 3:1-2, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>. To lay your hands upon the offering means that you identify yourself with what you offer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that you are declaring your oneness with the offering which you are presenting to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And this present which you offer is the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>ONE IN REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How can we be one with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is this just a positional matter, or is it possible to be one with Him in reality?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If so, how can we be one with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How can we lay our hands on Christ as a present to God?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The way is to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To lay our hands on the offering, which is Christ, is a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And to exercise our spirit is the fulfillment today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To exercise our spirit really makes us one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we come to present Christ to God as the peace offering, we need to exercise our spirit to declare that we are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, it is not just a positional matter; it is also a practical matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are practically one with Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, when we come to the tent of meeting to present Christ to God as a kind of present, we need to exercise our spirit that we might be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the first point concerning the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ONLY IN THE TENT OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second point is that the peace offering can be presented and enjoyed only in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not to be enjoyed at home, but it must be brought to the door of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that today the tent of meeting is the meetings of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is rather difficult for any one of us to enjoy Christ as the peace offering in our own home.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must be in the church meeting in order to have the position to enjoy Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, I realize that some will say that the Lord is omnipresent; He is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, He can be enjoyed everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I will not say that you cannot enjoy the Lord everywhere, but I am sure you cannot enjoy the Lord as the peace offering everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may enjoy the Lord in other aspects, but you cannot enjoy the Lord as the peace offering in any place but in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is exceedingly vital.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To enjoy the peace offering is not to be done at home, but absolutely in the tent of meeting.</S>
