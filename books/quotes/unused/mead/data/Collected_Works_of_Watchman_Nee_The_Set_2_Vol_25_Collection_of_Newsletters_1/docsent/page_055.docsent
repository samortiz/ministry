   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ISSUE NO.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>7 June 20, 1934 A LETTER FROM TAISHAN, KWANTUNG PROVINCE Incoming Letter</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peace to the brothers in the Lord, Messrs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman and Kuang Hsiung:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the brothers and sisters in the meeting in Kung Ho City, Taishan have been blessed by God with peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We moved our meeting to No. 26 Kung Ho City more than a month ago.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since moving, we have been blessed by God very much with opportunities to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we still hope for more prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are about thirty sisters in the meeting, but there are only three brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One of them is Brother Ts'ai Chih Yun.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was baptized into the Lord two months ago.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His clinic is near the Church of Christ in China.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has had a good relationship with the preachers in the denominations, but he never would believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He received the book Bible Studies for Beginners by Brother Nee and after studying the Bible with this book, he got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He also knew that the Lord hated denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So he was not tempted by profits, nor was he afraid of taunts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He boldly became one who only belongs to Christ and entered into the name of our Lord Christ, worshipping God the Father in sincerity and in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now he speaks the gospel zealously and really testifies that the Holy Spirit is with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After I left the Baptist Church on June 29 of last year, thank the Lord, His grace has been sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because I have had blisters on the bottoms of my feet people in Kwangchow call them Hong Kong feet , I could not go out on the street before December 25 of last year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though I am wearing shoes and socks to go out and preach to people, my blisters still have not gotten better!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope the brothers and sisters in all the localities will pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After leaving the denomination, I had many questions I wanted to ask, but fortunately the sisters here gave me many of Brother Nee's books to read, so I received much light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now I have written my questions they are published in the answering letter .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Please answer them for me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you two brothers are busy, please ask another brother to answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May God the Father bless your spirits and bodies with strength and health!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>T'ang Yen Min</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May 15, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Answering Letter</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To the brother in the Lord, Yen Min:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have read your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Chang is in Tsinan now, and Brother Nee asked me to answer this for him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I will answer your three questions as follows:</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Question: "There is a sister who fasts on the Lord's Day and does not eat pork on Fridays.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although we cannot argue with her about her doubts, can we exhort her?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Answer: If this sister fasts on the Lord's Day because she has a burden in her spirit, do not exhort her to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can exhort her to stop fasting if she does not have a burden and you can exhort her to stop abstaining from pork on Fridays, but you do not need to forbid her.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Question: "Some people believe that they are saved but that if they sin in the future, they still might perish eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are these people weak in the faith, or are they completely unsaved?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Answer: If these people have already believed and received the Lord Jesus as their Savior, they are already saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They think that they could perish if they sin after being saved because they probably do not know the Bible well enough.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot say that they are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the Bible, once a person believes, he is eternally saved and cannot perish.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus said, "Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out" John 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He also said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life" v. 47 . Once we believe, we are not only saved, but we also gain "eternal life." "Eternal life" is the life that lives to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It can never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So the Lord said again, "I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever" 10:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The verses used by some as the basis for perdition after salvation should not be interpreted in their way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most of these verses refer to entering the kingdom, not to salvation and the receiving of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Entering the kingdom and receiving eternal life are two different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Question: Is it all right for a brother who has already taken the table on the Lord's Day to go to another place in the evening and break bread with them there?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Answer: If the "other place" is a denomination, he is eating at the table of a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>According to the Bible he should not do that.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please read Collection of Newsletters, Issue No. 5, for the answer concerning the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We had best exhort this kind of brother through the light of the Bible not to go to the denominations to eat the supper.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But we cannot refuse him just because he has gone to the denominational supper also.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I respectfully greet you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May 22, 1934</S>
