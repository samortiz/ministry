Let us now go on to consider some other characteristics of this unlimited Christ.<h2 class=head2>Giving the Spirit Not by Measure</h2><p>John 3:34 says of the unlimited Christ, &#8220;He gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; In what way does the unlimited Christ give us the Spirit? He gives us the Spirit by speaking the word of God. However, some Christians think that the way to receive the Spirit is to fast and pray for a period of time. But this practice may lead to emptiness instead. I can testify that the way of fasting and praying to receive the Spirit was not effective for me. What is the proper way to receive the Spirit without measure? It is by receiving the rhema of God. We can testify that if we handle the Word of God rightly and digest it in our spirit, we shall be filled with the Spirit of God. This is real in our experience.<p>The unique way for us to become the universal increase of the unlimited Christ is to receive the Spirit and be filled with the Spirit. The more we have of the Spirit, the more we shall be Christ&#8217;s increase. This increase begins with our regeneration, and it consummates with our being filled with the immeasurable Spirit.<p>We need to learn not merely to read the Word or study it, but also to eat it. We must learn to receive the Word of God into our spirit and digest it there. This is to enjoy the Word of God in our spirit. Many of us can testify that when we enjoy the Lord in this way, we are filled with the immeasurable Spirit.<p>In the past a number of us were influenced, distracted, or misled by the concept that we need to fast and pray for a period of time in order to suddenly receive the Spirit. The genuine filling of the Spirit is by taking the Word of God in a proper way through the exercise of our spirit. We shall not experience the filling of the Spirit by merely studying the Word in order to stimulate our mentality. That is not the right way to handle the Word of God. As we read the Word, we need to exercise our spirit. We need to exercise our spirit to receive God&#8217;s written Word so that it may become the present, spoken word to us. Then we shall have the word within us as spirit and life to us. In this way the all-inclusive Spirit will be given to us by the unlimited Christ.<p>Many of us can testify that as we are filled with the immeasurable Spirit through eating the Word, we realize that the Giver of this Spirit is the unlimited Christ. Christ Himself is unlimited, and the Spirit He gives to us is immeasurable. Therefore, our enjoyment of Christ and the Spirit becomes eternal. We enjoy eternal life, and this life produces the universal increase of the unlimited Christ. I hope that we all shall see this clearly.<h2 class=head2>Giving Eternal Life to His Believers</h2><p>Through the Word we receive the Spirit, and when we have the Spirit, we have eternal life. This understanding corresponds to what is revealed in John 6:63, where the Lord says that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This indicates that when we have the rhema, the living, spoken word, we also have the Spirit and life. Therefore, in this chapter we have the speaking of the word of God, the giving of the Spirit without measure, and the imparting of eternal life to those who believe in Christ. Verses 15, 16, and 36 all say clearly that those who believe in Christ the Son have eternal life. The unlimited Christ is the One who gives eternal life to His believers.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
