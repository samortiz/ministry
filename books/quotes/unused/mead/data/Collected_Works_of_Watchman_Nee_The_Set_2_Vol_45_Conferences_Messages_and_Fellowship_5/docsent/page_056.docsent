   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1925 I was in the midst of publishing the second issue of The Christian, covering Daniel, 2 Thessalonians, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that time I was not very knowledgeable concerning the prophecies, and I wrote about them in a very brief way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I attached to it a preface and sent it to the printer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I felt very good about it and did not have much regret about printing it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, I received over three hundred responses from readers telling me that they had liked it and received help, encouragement, and admonition from it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I felt quite proud of myself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day, as I was with Miss Barber, I asked, "Have you received a copy of The Christian that I edited?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What do you think of its content?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She was not interested in this at all, talking only about her tea and cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I tried a few more times to draw her attention to my magazine, but she kept on talking about tea, cakes, and candies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was about to leave, she said one word to me, "Brother, one day you will discover that good things are not necessarily good."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I asked if she was referring to the second issue of The Christian, and she said yes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She continued, saying, "If I had to put out ten issues of The Christian, I would not put those things in one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would write on something else."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At that time I did not appreciate what she said.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But day after day, I began to realize that it is not how much we can produce and achieve, but how much God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything that issues from man is futile, whether it is human wisdom or human power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One time I took a sister to visit Miss Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sister did something wrong, and after Miss Barber spoke with her, she cried from morning until the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I went back and asked Miss Barber, "Do you know that she has been crying?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I thought that her repentance was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But after Miss Barber heard my word, her reaction was very cold.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I tried my best to describe how repentant the sister was, but Miss Barber replied, "She is pitying herself!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not like to help this kind of person."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time I could not quite take these words.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I felt that Miss Barber was compassionless, uncaring, and unsympathetic toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But after a year or two I found that she was right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I thought that repentance, tears, weeping, and remorse for one's own sins were the right things to have.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But she was able to discriminate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not a matter of criticism or compassion, but a matter of seeing or not seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The one who had the vision had the spiritual knowledge of good and evil, but I did not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once I took over sixty co-workers to see Miss Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She said "If five or six from among these ones remain to follow the Lord, we should be thankful and praise the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In reflecting on her words today, I can see that it is just about that number that are still following the Lord in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Miss Barber possessed this spiritual ability to discriminate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The good and evil that I am speaking of here are different from the good and evil that ordinary men speak of.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In many instances what is good and evil to man may be exactly the opposite in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are good at criticizing others often have a wrong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But those who have the knowledge of good and evil have the right eyes for things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because their eyes have seen the light, their words are a kind of spiritual discernment rather than a kind of criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I appreciate Brother Austin-Sparks because he also has such a spiritual ability to discriminate between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One man lived together with me for a few months; however, Brother Austin-Sparks seldom saw him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet he knew this man more than I did.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are not here to criticize others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who criticize others will not have God's blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But we do need a kind of spiritual discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our knowledge of good and evil should not only be applied to people, but should be applied to things as well.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times in making judgments on things, those who have the light can tell the difference between good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who have seen the light do not even need to seek after God's will; they are already clear about God's will within themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE WAY TO THE SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>OF GOOD AND EVIL God's Word</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Genesis 3 and Hebrews 4 and 5 are three places in the Bible that speak of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The discriminating between good and evil in Hebrews 5 is spiritual; it is a mark of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hebrews 4 tells us how we can discriminate between good and evil, and where the power of discrimination lies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only God can discriminate between good and evil because all things are laid bare before His eyes and cannot be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There are many things which are unknown to man, but God says that those who are spiritual can discern all things 1 Cor 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what Hebrews 4 speaks of.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God's word can divide and cut asunder man's soul and spirit, discerning the true nature of things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Soulish ones criticize others and exercise their mind to split hairs over small things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But spiritual things can be known only in an inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A person must first be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Before he can have a clear vision before God concerning all things, he must first have God's word.</S>
