   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Disposition and Our Human Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we look back at our life, we can realize that many of our sufferings were caused by the peculiar traits in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because of his disposition, a student may be frustrated from studying, and his professors may not care for him personally.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result, he will not be able to make good grades.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If that person's disposition could be changed, he would be able to make better grades.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a law court, a judge may be negatively influenced by a person's peculiar traits, causing that person not to receive a favorable judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in a family, one child may suffer more than the other children because of his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An employer may realize that an employee has a peculiar trait, but because the company needs him, they will keep him on.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, when the company begins to lay off its workers, he may be the first one to go.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may also suffer in our own neighborhood because of our peculiar traits.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may love people and love to help people, but because of our peculiar traits, none of our neighbors may care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The negative factor in our marriage life and family life is our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Seemingly, the problems between parents and children are due to certain mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, mistakes are easy to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mistakes are like dust on a desk top that can be wiped away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The real cause of the problems between parents and children are the peculiar traits in their makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If either the parents' or the children's disposition would change, there would not be such problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, even the parents are not able to change themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, the problems accumulate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Year after year there is an accumulation of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This accumulation may be compared to the cause of earthquakes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>An earthquake is caused by the gradual accumulation of pressure underneath the earth which finally breaks forth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though the parents and children love each other and live for each other for many years, the accumulation eventually may lead to a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our peculiar traits also cause us to suffer in our marriage life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A husband and a wife may love each other, but after being married for several months, the wife may discover a "burl" in her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The real problem between husbands and wives is the particular and peculiar part of their makeup, their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the factor that can make the husband and wife unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A pleasant husband and a pleasant wife are those who have no peculiar traits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A wife's beauty does not make her pleasant for long.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A brother may be charmed by a sister's beauty while they are dating and on their wedding day, but after they live together for a short time, he may realize that he married a beautiful sister who is very hard to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that time on, the peculiar traits will cause trouble between them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The husband and wife may love and appreciate each other, but the accumulation of problems produced by their peculiar traits may eventually lead to divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church life, the accumulation of problems over many years may lead to rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Dealing with Our Disposition</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the four Gospels, Peter's most difficult dealing before the Lord was related to his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even by the time of Galatians 2:11-21, Peter's disposition had not yet been thoroughly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Something troubling still remained within him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the record of the whole New Testament, however, Peter eventually broke through.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Galatians 2 Paul rebuked Peter to his face because Peter still lived in his disposition to some degree, but in 2 Peter 3:15-16 Peter highly commended Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If Peter had been still living in his disposition, he would not have made such a strong commendation of the one who rebuked him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rebuking offends people, but Peter was not offended.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This may indicate that the "burl," the troublemaking factor, had been removed from him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By man's hand there is no way to remove the factor of the disposition, but in the Lord's hand there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Matthew 19:25 the disciples asked the Lord, "Who then can be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord replied, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible" Matt 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This word must have been fulfilled in Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 2 Peter 1:5-11 Peter wrote concerning the development of what the Lord has given us by the growth in life unto the rich entrance into the eternal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peter was able to write such a word because he had learned the spiritual lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord broke through in him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is impossible for us to break through the problem of our disposition, but it is possible for the Lord to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the first few years of our spiritual life, we may have grown quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, our growth may have slowed down or even come to a standstill because of our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should be warned concerning our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must learn to take care of the "burl" in our makeup, our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we deal with the "burl," we will grow quickly and have a free way in our spiritual life without any hindrances to our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will also become more useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Question: Why does our disposition not frustrate our growth in life at the beginning of our spiritual life?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Answer: At the beginning of our spiritual life, our disposition was buried by our worldliness, weaknesses, and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We grew quickly by dealing with the world, our weak points, and our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After we dealt with these superficial, negative things, we reached a deeper problem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The deeper problem was what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In our being, there was a "burl."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our free way was cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We could not go on and became blocked in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our disposition has become our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It hinders us from growing in life and from being used by the Lord, and it has made trouble for us, causing us to suffer.</S>
