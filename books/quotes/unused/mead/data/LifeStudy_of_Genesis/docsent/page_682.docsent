   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The people who came to Joseph for food paid four kinds of prices: their money, their cattle, their land, and themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How happy I am that the record in the Bible is so complete!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These four items cover all the prices we need to pay today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we pay with our money, cattle, lands, and ourselves, we receive all four types of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first supply is not as rare or precious as the fourth supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Each supply is more precious than the previous one, and the last is the most precious of all.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us now consider what money signifies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to a superficial understanding, money is what we depend on.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, money represents convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The monetary system in this country is very convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Joseph's time the people used silver.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They had to carry silver with them and weigh it out when making a purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But today when we pay a bill, we simply write out a check for a certain amount.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is very convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, when the supply in our checking account is depleted, we lose this convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At such a time we may worry about paying our bills.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all like to have a surplus in our checking account.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what will you do if this supply runs out?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some are not willing to pay the price for the supply because they are concerned about losing their conveniences.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some may say, "Should I take the way of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surely this way is good, but if I take it, I will lose certain conveniences.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My wife or my relatives may be unhappy with me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the more conveniences you give up, the more life supply you will have.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today's Christians, however, keep their conveniences, but have no life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In many cathedrals, chapels, and church buildings people hear messages every Sunday about conveniences.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They go to these places to get more conveniences.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For them, to take the way of the Lord's recovery is costly and inconvenient.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yes, if you take this way, you will lose your conveniences, but you will gain the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second item the people had to pay for the food supply was their cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is easy to understand what is signified by cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Cattle signifies the means of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Joseph's brothers were concerned about their donkeys, worried that Joseph would find some excuse to take them away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today you may care very much about your automobile.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Perhaps you are afraid that it will be stolen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If so, your automobile is your donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For those with a doctoral degree, their degree is their donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For others their position is their donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But Christ, the rich One, the Supplier, is here, and He is neither generous nor stingy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although He does not want to squeeze anything out of you, for your sake He requires that you pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will never sell His supply cheaply.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After you pay your money, you need to pay with your cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only by handing over your cattle will you receive the second supply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When both our money and our cattle have been handed over to Him, we shall be restful and at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After handing over our cattle, we need to hand over our land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The land represents our resources.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus is a "robber"; He "robs" His lovers of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He takes our money, our cattle, and our land.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may say, "Give me your land.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not keep the resources under your control, but hand them over to me."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not a teaching, but an observation of what I have seen in the lives of many.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some dear ones were able to pay their money, but not their cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others could give up their cattle, but not their land.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Their concept was that the Lord Jesus always gives them things, but never "robs" them of things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But the Lord Jesus in His recovery "robs" us of everything of our convenience, our means of livelihood, and our resources.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are willing to give the Lord your lands, you will receive the third supply.</S>
