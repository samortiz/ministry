   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today He is both in the heavens seated at the right hand of God Rom 8:34 and in us v. 10 . This is very mysterious.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is working in the heavens, and at the same time He is also working in us according to the heavenly television.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is God's move in man in the ascension of Christ, so it is also God's history.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were regenerated, but it was the Triune God who regenerated us.</S>
