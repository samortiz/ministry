<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT WITH RESPECT TO REGENERATION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:1, 5; Col. 2:13; John 3:6; Ezek. 36:26; Rom. 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; John 4:24; Rom. 1:9a; Eph. 6:18; Rom. 8:4-5; 1 Cor. 2:11; Gal. 6:1; 1 Pet. 3:3-4</h1><p>In this message we will see the condition of our spirit in three stages: before regeneration, at the time of regeneration, and after regeneration.<h2 class=head1>THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT BEFORE REGENERATION</h2><p>According to Ephesians 2:1 and 5 and Colossians 2:13, our spirit was deadened before we were regenerated. Apparently, these verses do not mention the word spirit. However, consider our past before we were regenerated. Before regeneration our body was not dead. If our body was dead, we should have been buried. Before we were regenerated, our soul was not dead either. In fact, it was very active and alive. The body was not dead, the soul was not dead, and neither was our heart dead, but these two portions of the Word say clearly that we were dead. In what part then were we dead? Since we have a spirit, a soul, and a body, it must be that before the time of our regeneration we were dead in our spirit.<p>For the spirit to be dead mainly means that it lost its function. If my eyes lose their function, then they are dead eyes. The function of the spirit is to contact God, receive God, and sense God. Before we were regenerated, our body was very alive, and our soul was very active with many functions, but our spirit was dormant, without function and without the sense of God. Since the function to contact God was lost, our spirit was deadened and dormant.<h2 class=head1>THE CONDITION OF OUR SPIRIT AT THE TIME OF REGENERATION</h2><p>According to the same verses mentioned above in Ephesians and Colossians, at the time of regeneration our spirit was made alive. In addition, John 3:6 tells us that our deadened spirit was not only made alive but also was regenerated. This verse says, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” According to Ezekiel 36:26, our regenerated spirit was also renewed. Our dead spirit had become old. Everything dead becomes old; dead things are old things, like an old, dead tree. Now at the time of regeneration the deadened spirit was made alive, regenerated, and renewed. It became a living spirit and a new spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE CONDITION AND FUNCTION OF OUR SPIRIT AFTER REGENERATION</h2><h2 class=head2>The Condition of Our Spirit—Being Indwelt by the Holy Spirit and by Christ Himself</h2><p>After we were regenerated, our conscience was purged and cleansed by the blood of Jesus, the fellowship of the spirit was revived, and the intuition of the spirit was made sensitive. However, there is something more important than this related to the condition of our spirit. After regeneration the Spirit of God is now in our spirit. Not only is the spirit itself with its three parts revived, but it now has the Spirit of God, even Christ Himself, in it. Romans 8:16 tells us that the Spirit today is in our spirit. This verse says, “The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.” Then 2 Timothy 4:22 confirms that Christ is in our spirit: “The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.” This verse is as important as John 3:16, but almost no one pays attention to it. John 3:16 says that God so loved the world, that is, the people of this world, that He gave His Son to them. Now we have His Son. Where is He? He is in our spirit.<p>Some dear Christians, even certain Christian teachers, say that the spirit is the same as the soul. However, we cannot find a verse that tells us that the Holy Spirit is in our soul, nor can we find a verse saying that the Lord Jesus Christ is with our soul. Romans 8:16 says that the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit, and 2 Timothy 4:22 says that the Lord is with our spirit. Now we are clear about the condition of our spirit. Our spirit is made alive, regenerated, and renewed, the Holy Spirit is in it, and the Lord is with it. Our spirit is in a very healthy and strong condition.
