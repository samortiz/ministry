   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PROOF BY ITS PROPHECIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prophecies are the strongest proof of the authenticity of the Bible as the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To prophesy is risky.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once a prophecy is not fulfilled, its source is discredited.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a prophetic word in every four verses of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are more than one thousand individual prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fulfillment of the prophecies proves the existence of God and the Bible to be God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>People may not believe the miracles recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They may say that they were merely myths and legends.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is indeed hard to prove that the miracles happened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prophecies, on the other hand, are great miracles that can be substantiated and therefore cannot be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God knew man s inclination to doubt and disbelieve; that is why He put so many prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A prophecy should meet the following five criteria: 1 it should be announced before things happen; 2 it should be beyond human foresight; 3 it should explain in detail; 4 the duration of time between prophecy and fulfillment should be long enough so that the fulfillment cannot be of human manufacture; and 5 the fulfillment should be clearly manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let us proceed to see some of the biblical prophecies that have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A. Concerning Christ</S>
