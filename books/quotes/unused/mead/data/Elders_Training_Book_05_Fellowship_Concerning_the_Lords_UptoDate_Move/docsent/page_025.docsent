   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE AGE OF THE OLD CREATION,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE AGE OF THE NEW CREATION,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE AGE OF RESTORATION KNOWING THE BIBLE ACCORDING TO DISPENSATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have already seen that in order to expound the Bible in a proper, adequate, and high way we need a knowledge of the theology of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The top point of Brethren theology is that they opened up the Bible in the matter of dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Reformed theology rejects the thought of dispensations and believes that the Old Testament is the same as the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this theology there is no difference between the age of the law and the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Brethren were the first ones to begin to know the Bible not only according to its spiritual principles, but also according to dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The problem that the Galatians had was that they did not have a clear vision of the change in dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Judaizers spoiled the distinction between the law and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Under the law what was needed was works, but under faith only believing is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To understand the book of Galatians, you must have the clear concept of God s dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God deals with His chosen people in different ages in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Under the law God dealt with His people according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the age of grace, God deals with His people according to grace by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul wrote Hebrews 6:4-5 according to God s dispensations: For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those who were once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all have been enlightened, having received the heavenly light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have also received the heavenly gift of the divine life, and the Holy Spirit, so we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 4 we have tasted of the heavenly gift and in verse 5 we have tasted of the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are three kinds of tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The enlightenment, the heavenly gift, the Holy Spirit, and the good word of God belong to the present age, the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The works of power belong to the coming age, the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the New Testament, miracles and works of power are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The previous age was the age of law, this present age is the age of grace, and the age to come is the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE IMPARTING OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>IN CONTRAST TO MIRACLES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the age of the law there was no regeneration and in the coming age there will be no regeneration either.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regeneration is only in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regeneration is to be born again with another life, the higher life, the divine life, to be a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To regenerate the fallen and dead people with the divine life to make them a new creation was not present in the age of the law and will no longer be there in the coming age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regeneration is absolutely a unique thing in this age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a unique thing does not have any relationship to miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Miracles are not related to our spirit, but to our bodies; however, regeneration is absolutely related to our spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 8:11 tells us that the divine life can even be given to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not a miracle, but a matter of the imparting of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For the Lord to give life to our mortal body is for Him to impart the divine life into our natural body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That imparting of the divine life has nothing to do with miracles and is absolutely a spiritual matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord comes back our body will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not a miracle but the saturation of our body with the divine life for God s expression and our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God does two kinds of work: one kind belongs to the spirit with the divine life, and another kind, which are the works not of life but of power, are miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Works of power are related to our physical body and not to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the Lord raised Lazarus from the dead, that was not something related to his spirit but to his body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We know that his being raised from the dead had nothing to do with his spirit because he died again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During the Lord Jesus earthly ministry many were healed or raised from the dead, but they all eventually died.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is strong proof that miracles do not have any relationship to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must realize that there were miracles in the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Elisha performed many miracles, among which were the raising of the Shunammite s dead son 2 Kings 4:32-37 and the healing of Naaman the leper 2 Kings 5:9-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although healings were there in the Old Testament, there was no regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE WORKS OF POWER OF THE COMING AGE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some of the works of power of the coming age are described in the book of Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The coming age will be full of works of power.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Isaiah 11:6-9 says, The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the coming age the wolf will dwell with the lamb and a little child will lead wild animals.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These miraculous things will be present in the coming kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Also, regarding the coming age, Isaiah 35:5-10 says, Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there: and the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These verses are a further description of the blessings in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then Isaiah 65:25 says, The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent s meat.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The three aforementioned portions from Isaiah are a picture of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The coming age will be an age full of miracles, not only in healing but also in restoration.</S>
