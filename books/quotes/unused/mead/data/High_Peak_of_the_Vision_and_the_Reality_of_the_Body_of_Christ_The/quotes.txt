[1]  CONTENTS The High Peak of the Vision 1 The High Peak of the Vision 2 The Reality of the Body of Christ 1 The Reality of the Body of Christ 2
[2]  This book is a translation of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee in his fellowship with the elders from Taipei on May 17-20, 1994 in Anaheim, California.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE HIGH PEAK OF THE VISION 1
[4]  Prayer: O Lord, how we thank You for making it possible for us to have such a gathering.
[5]  Lord, when we look back at the past up to the present time, we truly worship You, for everything depends on Your mercy and everything is done by Your mercy.
[6]  After this God showed us the Body of Christ through Brother Nee.
[7]  The Lord showed us that the local church is the procedure and not the goal.
[8]  We have published a book recording solely the messages given by Brother Nee during the resumption of his ministry see Messages Given during the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry, published by Living Stream Ministry .
[9]  THE TURNING OF THE LORD'S REVELATION AND VISION AND THE ARRIVING AT THE HIGH PEAK
[10]  In Brother Nee the Lord's revelation and vision reached the Body of Christ.
[11]  When the Lord raised us up in China, He showed us the entire vision in the Bible in a brief and concise way through Brother Nee, the main points of which I fellowshipped with you in the previous chapter: the salvation of God, the church, Christ as life, and the Body of Christ.
[12]  THE TRANSFER OF THE MINISTRY IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY AND THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK IN TAIWAN
[13]  After I arrived in Taiwan, outside the house I heard the noise of wooden shoes on the gravel road, and inside the house I saw a room with Japanese tatami.
[14]  At the end of 1950 I went to Manila.
[15]  I worked there for five and a half months, and just before I left, a brother went to the elders and asked them to make an appointment for him to see me.
[16]  THE ADVANCING AND ASCENDING OF THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY
[17]  From the monthly publication The Ministry of the Word you can see that we were still shallow.
[18]  GOD BECOMING MAN GOING THROUGH THE CREATION OF MAN AND HIS COMING PERSONALLY TO BECOME MAN
[19]  Tonight I would like to spend some time to speak on how God became man.
[20]  Although what God created was man, this man whom He created had the image of God.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 1
[22]  Prayer: O Lord, we pray that You will open our eyes that we may really know You, how You as merely God were incarnated, lived a human life, were crucified, and entered into resurrection to become the consummated God with divinity, humanity, the experiences of human living, and the effectiveness of death and resurrection.
[23]  You have become the Spirit, and today You live in us to carry out a particular work in us to make us God.
[24]  THE HUMAN VIRTUES OF JESUS EXPRESSING THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES
[25]  We need to see that the death of Christ has not only a negative aspect but also a positive aspect.
[26]  That the Lord Jesus was God was concealed for thirty-three and a half years in His flesh, in His human form.
[27]  CHRIST AS THE SEED OF DAVID BECOMING THE SON OF GOD
[28]  After the Lord went through His death and resurrection, one of His disciples said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"
[29]  In Christ's resurrection, not only was Christ with His humanity begotten as the firstborn Son, but those who had been chosen by God and redeemed through the death of Christ were born as the many sons of God.
[30]  In the resurrection of Christ, first, Jesus with His humanity was begotten to be the firstborn Son of God; second, we, the God-chosen and Christ-redeemed people, were begotten to be the many sons of God; and third, the last Adam in His humanity, who is the incarnated Jesus, became the life-giving Spirit.
[31]  Actually, this word means that God became a man in order to make all of us, His believers, God.
[32]  Now we go on to see the reality of the Body of Christ.
[33]  Prayer: Lord, our heart is full of thanks for Your recovery.
[34]  O Lord, we pray that You will open our eyes again tonight that within us we may see clearly that the reality of the Body of Christ is the living of God and man together.
[35]  Simply, the reality of the Body of Christ is the living of a God-man life by a group of God-redeemed people together with the God-man Christ.
[36]  THE LIVING OF JESUS ON THE EARTH BEING A MODEL OF A LIVING SHARED BY GOD AND MAN
[37]  When the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, He was genuinely a man, but instead of living by the life of man He lived by God as His life.
[38]  Thus, in His life and in His living He lived the divine attributes as His human virtues manifested before the eyes of men.
[39]  In those days the Galileans did not know, but today we know that those virtues were lived out of the God-man Jesus, who as a man lived not by Himself but by God and who lived out the divine attributes and manifested them as the virtues of such a One who is God yet man.
[40]  Rather, they realized that He is God because they saw the attributes of the very nature of God lived out through a man to become the very virtues of that man.
[41]  Since we were born of God the Father in Christ, and since our Father God is God, how can we, the children begotten of Him, not be God?
[42]  THE LIVING OF MAN BECOMING GOD BEING A LIVING OF DEATH AND RESURRECTION UNDER THE CROSS
[43]  After the Lord practically lived out a typical God-man, He accomplished redemption through His death and resurrection to redeem us and regenerate us to be the same as He is.
[44]  This divine life is the life of the One who is God yet man, the life that was lived out by the One who was God incarnated to be a man and who became the God-man, not by His human life but by His divine life.
[45]  CHRIST LIVING, AND WE ALSO LIVING BECAUSE OF HIM
[46]  In John 14:16-17 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality.
[47]  Whereas formerly they had lived by their own life, now after they had been crucified with Christ, they lived by the life of the Triune God, who had resurrected them.
[48]  What we do and speak in the meetings mostly is not the reality of the Body of Christ.
