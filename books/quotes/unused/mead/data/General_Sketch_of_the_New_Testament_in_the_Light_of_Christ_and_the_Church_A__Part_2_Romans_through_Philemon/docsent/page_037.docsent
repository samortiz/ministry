   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN WALKING BY THE SPIRIT IN GALATIANS Scripture Reading: Gal 3:16, 29; 5:16-17, 22, 25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the order and the arrangement of the books of the New Testament, there is the sovereignty of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is appropriate to have 1 and 2 Corinthians follow Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The two Epistles to the Corinthians show us that the Christian walk and the church life are a matter not of gifts or knowledge but of Christ being wrought into us by the working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They deal with gifts and knowledge on the negative side and with the living Christ working within us through His cross on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the central thought of these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then following 1 and 2 Corinthians, we have Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the right order.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PROBLEM OF THE LAW AND JUDAISM</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the realm of religion, the law is a prevailing problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For thousands of years of human civilization, there has never been anything as prevailing and prominent as the law given to man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Among the human race, many philosophies and ethical systems have been invented.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the human thought, not only philosophy and ethics but also certain religions formed among people are helpful to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The most outstanding item in this realm is the law given to man by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a significant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among all the races in human civilization, the law given by God is the greatest item.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is greater than all the other human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is greater, better, and higher than all philosophies and teachings of ethics and all forms of religion on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Based upon the law given by God, the Jewish religion was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Judaism is the highest and the most genuine religion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, Christ has now come, and the church has come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now in the universe, particularly on this earth, there is the universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can the law given by God with the Jewish religion based on this law coexist with Christ and the church?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we have the law with its religion together with this universal man?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Are these two contradictory to one another, or can these two be reconciled?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the first and greatest problem that the church faced.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately after the birth of the church, the church faced its biggest problem, the law and its religion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Judaism and the law were the biggest deterring factors to the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, after Paul's two Epistles to the Corinthians, Galatians deals with this matter of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to be very impressed with the matter of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must understand where the law stands in relation to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must know what kind of position God has given the law and what the function and purpose of the law are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE POSITION OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Jewish people believe that besides God nothing is as great as the law.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only God Himself is higher and greater than the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In their understanding they give all the ground to the law; it is second only to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we ourselves must deal with the problem of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our understanding and according to God's revelation, what is the position assigned by God to the law?</S>
