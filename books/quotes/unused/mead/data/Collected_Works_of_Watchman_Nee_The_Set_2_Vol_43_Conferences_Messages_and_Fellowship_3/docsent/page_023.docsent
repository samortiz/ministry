   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD JESUS SHEDDING HIS BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO REPAY OUR DEBT OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If God forgives our sins in a loose way, He will violate the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can God save us and at the same time not get into trouble Himself?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not difficult to forgive sins, but it is not easy to have a forgiveness in a way that is righteous and lawful.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What can God do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let me use the earlier illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mr. Tang is a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only does he loan me ten thousand dollars, but he also has a great deal of cash.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day he comes to my house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At first he speaks very severely to me, saying, "The contract is definite, and it cannot be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You have to repay the money."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After he says this, he whispers in my ear, "I also have another ten thousand dollars that I am going to give to you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The money you borrowed was bound by a contract, but this money is yours for free!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then he leaves without a further word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The next morning I can bring the ten thousand dollars that he gave me and walk into his house with boldness and confidence, saying, "Did I owe you this much?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will say, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I then give the money to him, he will give the contract note back to me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the way God's law works.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God says, "If you observe the law, you will live; otherwise, you will die."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we disobey the law, God cannot treat it lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God gave us the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, He cannot disobey His own law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What can God do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God gave us His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But this is not the law; rather, it is apart from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God's love constrained Him to give us His only begotten Son to shed His blood for us to repay our debt of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can come to God by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is how God saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now everyone who is in Christ Jesus has his sin-debts forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God cannot seek repayment from us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our sins were not removed in a light manner; they were judged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have the proof that Christ Jesus has obtained the forgiveness of sins for us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I give the money back to Mr. Tang, he will be unrighteous if he does not return the contract note to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our Lord has already paid the debt of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we can come boldly and confidently before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By the blood of Christ, God is obligated to save us because this salvation fully satisfies the righteous requirements of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please remember that the proof of Christ's forgiveness of our sins is God's righteousness 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters, our sins are not forgiven freely.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because the price of redemption has been paid, our sins can now be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please remember that we are cleansed by the Lord's blood 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we come before God, we can come boldly and without fear in our conscience because the Lord has paid the debt once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God can no longer go after the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From now on we can praise God instead.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Finally, I would like to tell you a story.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is my favorite story.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1925 I went to speak at a girls' school in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One day I spoke to the students about God's righteousness, but they could not understand what I was speaking about.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After I spoke for a long time, they still had dazed looks on their faces.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By chance I spotted a vase on the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I asked the principal who was sitting next to me, "What would happen if one of your students broke the vase?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The principal said, "She would have to pay for it."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then I asked, "What if she did not have the money?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He said, "This is a rule of the school.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If anyone breaks something, she must pay for it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It matters not whether she has money."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I asked again, "Suppose she was your favorite student, the youngest and poorest, who simply could not pay.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What would you do?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He said, "Then that would be a different story."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How could he forgive her?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If he did, I am afraid that there would not be one single vase left in the school within a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What could he do?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He said, "The only way would be for me to pay for it."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God loves us, and this love is very "troublesome."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have sinned and cannot meet all the righteous requirements of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because God loves us, He has to meet His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God gave His only begotten Son to us to fully pay our sin-debts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In this way the problem is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When I spoke this way, all those students understood what I was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The next day was my last meeting with them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When I went in, I noticed that the vase was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I asked the principal, "What happened?"</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He said, "It was broken."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I said, "Did you ask her to pay for it?"</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He said, "Certainly."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I said, "Your words carry the aura of Mount Sinai!"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God has said that our sins are forgiven by the Lord's blood.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Suppose I commit a crime and am arrested by the police, and suppose the judge sentences me to five years in jail.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If, after I am released, I encounter the same policeman who arrested me previously, he cannot arrest me again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even if I mock him, he cannot arrest me again, because the crime has already been punished and the case has been settled.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In Christ all the debts of sins are repaid.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is God's righteous way to forgive our sins.</S>
