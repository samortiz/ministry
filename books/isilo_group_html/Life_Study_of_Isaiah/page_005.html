In this message we will consider Jehovah the Father's complaint against His children Israel, paying attention to Isaiah's account of what God said concerning them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE VISION OF ISAIAH<br>CONCERNING JUDAH AND JERUSALEM</H2><P>Isaiah 1:1 speaks of the vision which Isaiah saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. Before the time of Isaiah's ministry, the children of Israel had been divided into two nations&#151;the northern nation of Israel and the southern nation of Judah. At first, Isaiah does not give us an account of the failure of Israel but of Judah. The reason is that Judah bears more responsibility than Israel does. Therefore, God came to Isaiah with a vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II.

It was not an insignificant thing for Jehovah to do this.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
