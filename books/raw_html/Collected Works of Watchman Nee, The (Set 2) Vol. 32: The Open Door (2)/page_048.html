<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Fei Chang-bau, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Philip in the Lord:</p><p>From Issue No. 8 of The Open Door, I learned that you have recuperated from your sickness. Thank God for His great grace. Although I am separated from you in body, my heart has been constantly in fellowship with you before the Lord, and I often have mentioned your name and prayed for you before God.</p><p>Four years ago God revived His own work in the churches in Nan-Sha. The churches which long had been dormant have had a big turn. We can only thank and praise the Lord with all our hearts. I see that God is raising up a group of workers in Nan-Sha for the building up of Christ's Body. There are now seven places with the Lord's table, and three other places are about to begin. Recently, God raised up a group of gospel preachers to preach the gospel in the mountain villages around Shao-Shing. God has started His work. The door of preaching is now open, and soon churches will be established. Brother Shan Kai-fen often comes to help us. Although the political situation is tense, God has given us peace under His wings. God has shown me that if a servant of God is humble before God and men, God will continually use him. But if he becomes proud, he will immediately be set aside. David and Saul can be examples to us. When a church is in one accord, it will be revived. Throughout history there have always been two groups of people in the church. There are the fleshly ones and the spiritual ones. The fleshly ones always persecute the spiritual ones. But God's sovereignty always turns things to the benefit of the spiritual ones. The fleshly ones continually persecute the spiritual ones so that the self of the spiritual ones will die. God will deal with the fleshly ones and will save the spiritual ones. May we pray for each other before the Lord so that His plan will soon be fulfilled. May the Lord be with us until He returns, amen. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Fei Chang-bau, July 11</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><p>...Presently, there are no workers here. Brother Yu Cheng-hwa and others do not have the burden. As a result, the meeting that is on the line of the work (i.e., the Lord's Day morning meeting) was stopped temporarily. Thank the Lord! He has shown us that there is a difference between the church and the work and has taught us to obey this truth. According to the Lord's arrangement, we have no more meetings on the line of the work. But all the meetings of the local church continue as usual. Although most of the brothers and sisters are unaccustomed to this practice, we cannot easily invite people to preach, because we have to care for the Lord's work. Nevertheless, we feel that the brothers and sisters in Shanghai have been overfed. We would rather allow them to go hungry for a while. When they feel the need again, our Lord will surely provide....</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Yu Cheng-hwa, Wu You-an, Du Tsong-chen, Lin Kwang-biao<br />August 28</p><p>Please give our regards to Sisters Wang and Chang, Brother Chang Yu-zhi, and Mr. and Mrs. Yuen.</p><h2 class="head2">Yi-Yang, Hunan Province</h2><p>I received your two letters. I am concentrating on the work for the Lord and have no clear assurance yet. In the near future, I will have to find some way to support myself and wait on God's leading through a job. Over thirty brothers who fled from the war in Chekiang arrived here safely. They are now being accommodated at the Yi-Yang Relief Center. Please pray for them until, as you hoped, they no longer have a need to be supported by others and are self-sufficient. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>Brother Yu Yien-chuan, August 15</p>
