<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Saving Us by Entering into Us<br>to Consummate the Divine Incarnation</H2><P>Such a One is now ready to save us by entering into us. We had fallen into death and even into hell and the lake of fire. He did not save us by reaching down and snatching us up. He saved us by entering into us as the all-inclusive Spirit, as the consummation of the Triune God. As a result, we became so buoyant that we rose up to become a part of God. This is Christ's salvation.</P><P>Today He is not only in us, but He is everywhere. He fills all in all (Eph. 1:23b). He is not only all-inclusive; He is also all-extensive. Although He fills all in all, He takes us particularly as His dwelling. Now He is even making His home in our hearts (3:17). By doing so, He is building a home for Himself. He is everywhere, but particularly He is in us, taking us as His principal dwelling, making us His home. If we see this, we will be buoyant and will soar in the air. We have no other place to go but to Him. He is our Savior; He is our Redeemer; He is our life; He is our everything; and He is our eternal home. Today we are remaining in Him, abiding in Him, and living in Him to have our life in Him. This is why we are full of joy.</P><P>Up to this point the very Triune God still has not completed His incarnation. Since His passing through crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and after His pouring out of Himself, His incarnation has proceeded for another two thousand years. In these past twenty centuries He has been transfusing and also infusing Himself into millions of His believers, including you and me. He has transfused Himself into us, and He is now infusing us every day. Because of His transfusing and infusing, the more I speak, the more I have to speak. I cannot finish my speaking. Under His transfusing and infusing, we are all here becoming the very consummation of the divine incarnation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INTRINSIC VIEW OF GOD'S SALVATION</H2><P>Now we need to consider what God's salvation is. Many Christians have been taught that we were sinners, and our destiny was to go to hell. Because God loved us, He sent His Son to die for our sins and to be resurrected to be our Savior. If we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven. Then we will be saved by God and will have peace and joy. After being saved, we need to behave ourselves. Eventually, we will go to heaven. To many Christians, this is God's salvation. Although such a view may be biblical, it is according to the Bible in a superficial way. To understand the Bible in this way is like skating on ice. In studying the Bible, we need to cut a hole in the ice and dive to the bottom of the ocean to see what is there. It is there that we will see the depths, the very intrinsic significance, of the holy Word.</P><P>The salvation of God is not a simple or a shallow matter. God's salvation is the Triune God becoming a man, living a human life for thirty-three and a half years, dying an all-inclusive, all-terminating, all-redeeming, and all-releasing death, and accomplishing an all-producing resurrection. In such a condition and with such a situation, He ascended to the heavens to be made officially by God the Lord, the Christ, the Ruler of all the kings, and the Savior. Then He poured out Himself so that mankind could receive Him by calling on Him (Acts 2:17-21). Many did receive Him. Immediately He, as the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God, entered into everyone who received Him.</P>
