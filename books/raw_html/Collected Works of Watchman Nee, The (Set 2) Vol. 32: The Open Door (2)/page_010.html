<h2 class="head2">Ying County, Shansi Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Bu-yueh:</p><p>Since the coup last year, we have been under God's protection and care. Even though the situation was extremely tense, we felt God's messengers pitching tents around us and protecting us. We did not leave our dwelling and did not stop our meeting. When you see this letter, you should praise the Lord for us.</p><p>This year I was led by the Lord to go to Si-Tang, Dah-Tung, for a month and to Tso-Yun for more than ten days. I have the intention to go to Dong-Tang, Dah-Tung, and perhaps to regions around Tien-Tsen and Yang-Gao. It will be up to the Lord's leading. Please pray much for me.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Suen Rong, April 30<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Sian, Shensi Province</h2><p>Thank and praise the Lord! My wife and two children arrived safely three weeks ago from Hwai-Yuen, Anhwei, via Hsi-Chow. (We requested your prayer in Issue No. 5 of this magazine). While passing Hsi-Chow, a few dozen planes were conducting air raids. Many residents were killed or wounded. The sight was quite ghastly, but my wife and family were preserved. This has to be the special deliverance of the Lord! Along the way they witnessed the wonderful grace of the Lord, which was beyond what pen and ink can describe. We can only sing hallelujah and thanks to praise Him. A meeting was conducted here a month ago at the house of Sister Lee Kwei-rong in Dung-Kwan. The meeting stopped when Sister Lee moved to Tien-Shui. My family is temporarily sharing a room in Missionary Song's house (a Britain). I am asking friends to look for a place that can be used for our meeting as well as for my family's dwelling. Daily I commit this matter to prayer, and I ask that you pray for this matter also. Greetings in the Lord.</p><p>A weak brother,<br />Liu Jih-wu, June 2<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Fu-Ping, Shensi Province</h2><p>On May 29 six brothers felt to be baptized, and we baptized them in the name of the Lord in a hot spring outside the city. The meeting that day was full of rejoicing. I know that our God in heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the angels rejoiced even more. I intended to go to Hankow at the beginning of June, but circumstances hindered me. It appears that I will be delayed. I cannot say for sure when I will arrive in Hankow. I await the Lord's provision in everything. I am forwarding X dollars to cover the expense of publishing The Open Door.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Jing-hwa, June 5<br />[Address omitted]</p>
