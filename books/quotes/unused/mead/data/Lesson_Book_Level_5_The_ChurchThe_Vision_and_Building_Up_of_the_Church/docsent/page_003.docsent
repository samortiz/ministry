   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH BEING THE BUILDING UP OF ALL GOD'S CHOSEN, REDEEMED, REGENERATED, AND TRANSFORMED PEOPLE, NOT A PHYSICAL STRUCTURE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many in Christianity have made the church something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When some speak of the church, they mean a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they speak of going to church, they mean going to a chapel or cathedral or some kind of sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are material things constructed of bricks, stones, steel, or wood.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What a mistake this is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Have you made this mistake in the past?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you have, you will not make the same mistake after studying this lesson book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is a building, but the church is not a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is a building of all God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He first created His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His people, as a result of the fall, fell into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He then had to redeem them back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After being cleansed from sin, they needed to be regenerated with the life of God in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After being regenerated in their spirit they are suitable for the building, but their soul still needs sanctification and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sanctifying and transforming work is done by the Triune God to produce material for the building of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These building materials are living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are the chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CHURCH BEING THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD, NOT AN ORGANIZATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to see that the church as the Body of Christ is altogether organic, absolutely of life, with nothing organizational.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Triune God has an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An organism and an organization are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To illustrate this difference, we may compare a living person to a wooden stand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The wooden stand is without life, while a living person is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The wooden stand is an organization of pieces of wood put together, but a living person has many members which are joined together organically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person is a living, moving, functioning organism, unlike a robot, which is an organization of inorganic parts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is not an organization without life, but an organism with life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are born of God into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not join the church as we would join an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the church is a living organism ruled by life, there is no need of a hierarchy to organize or rule over the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are leading ones in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are not organizational leaders, but ones who are more mature in life to shepherd the younger, the newer, and the weaker ones in life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Praise the Lord for His organic church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE ESSENCE OF THE CHURCH IS OF LIFE, NOT OF KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The divine life, God's life, the eternal life, the uncreated life, the indestructible life, is the very essence of the church, and this divine life generates the church 1 John 1:2; 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anything that is not of life is not of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man left God in the garden of Eden because he took in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>From there man sinned, developed the world, lived in the flesh, loved only himself, and became separated from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before we were saved, we were alienated from the life of God and were not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we were saved, we received the life of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This life immediately made us a part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From that point on, we must feed the life in us and grow in this life so that we may be in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anything other than life does not belong in and is not part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Saints who care for knowledge bring death into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They not only deaden themselves they also deaden others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should never bring anything other than life into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We also should stay away from anything that is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The best way to be in life is to pray, read the Word, fellowship things of life, and preach the gospel.</S>
