   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE TEN BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY 9 Scripture Reading: Num 6:13-21</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Nazarite is a superior person, one who is absolutely, utterly, and ultimately for God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to be a Nazarite, one must pass through all the dealings with defilement and the test of suspicion in chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Anyone who has not passed through the dealings and the test in Numbers 5 cannot be a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A Nazarite must overcome four main things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, he must overcome the natural affection toward his blood relatives, the natural affection he has for his mother, father, wife, and children.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus overcame such natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Matthew 12:48 through 50 say, "Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And stretching out His hand over His disciples, He said, Behold, My mother and My brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For whoever does the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother and sister and mother."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus recognized as His relatives those who were His relatives in spirit, not those who were His relatives in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Surely the Lord Jesus was a real Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The best pattern of a Nazarite is the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since He is the pattern, we all must learn of Him, follow Him, and take His yoke Matt 11:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a rule, every New Testament believer should be a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, today it is difficult to find one proper New Testament Nazarite in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The second thing a Nazarite must overcome is earthly pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would be Nazarites, we must abstain from earthly pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Third, a Nazarite must deal with the rebellion in his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank God that we were created with an abundance of hair on our head, indicating that we are under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I can testify that it is a great blessing to be under someone, some thing, or some environment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the Japanese invasion of China, I was arrested by the Japanese and kept in prison for thirty days.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although I was under a very strict dealing and control, even that imprisonment was a blessing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Children and teenagers need to be under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A child who is not under authority will be unruly and wild.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The same is true of teenagers who are not willing to be under someone, some thing, or some environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the church life we all have received God and have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all have received the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this sense we all, including the Apostle Paul, are equal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, in the church some are babes.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In his first Epistle, John, in a general way, addressed all the saints as "little children" 2:1, 28; 3:7, 18; 4:4; 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, he respectively addressed some as "young children," others as "young men," and still others as "fathers" 2:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say that all the members of a family of three generations are the same would make the family a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In family life we surely need to respect the differences between the grandparents, the parents, and the children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The principle is the same in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Peter 5:5 says, "Younger men, be subject to elders."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although, in the spirit, the older ones should also learn to obey the younger ones Eph 5:21; 1 Pet 5:5b , still the difference in age remains.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a blessing to be under someone or some thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is even a blessing to be severely limited.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I thank the Lord that from the day I came into the recovery, the Lord put me under someone, some thing, or some environment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today some are teaching that it is not necessary for believers to submit to a deputy authority, that believers should not be under anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This erroneous teaching is very damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, it is damaging to those who teach in this way, and then it is damaging to the ones who receive such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who accept the teaching that the believers should not submit to deputy authority will be spoiled by this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some may even be spoiled without remedy in their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, it is a serious matter to teach that we should not submit to deputy authority, and it is also a serious matter to receive this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A Nazarite is a person full of hair, full of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With him there are a submissive spirit, standing, atmosphere, and intention.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are such a person, there will be a great blessing for you and for your future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Fourth, a Nazarite must always try his best to avoid death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not allow anyone to stand by you who is about to die suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If someone beside you dies suddenly, you may feel that your situation is excusable.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But there is no excuse for being defiled by death, and the sudden death of someone will cause your Nazarite vow to be made void.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Especially when rumors and gossip are spreading, it is better not to stand by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A person may suddenly die in front of you by uttering all kinds of death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once you have been contaminated by death, you need to deal with that contamination and have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise, you will be killed, and eventually the entire church, seemingly without explanation, will be brought into a deadened situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As Numbers 5 indicates, in order to be a Nazarite, one must pass through many dealings and severe tests.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Furthermore, according to 6:1-12, a Nazarite must overcome natural affection, worldly pleasure, rebellion, and deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, to be a Nazarite is to be something that is spiritually very high and superior.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us now consider 6:13-21 to see some further matters related to being a Nazarite.</S>
