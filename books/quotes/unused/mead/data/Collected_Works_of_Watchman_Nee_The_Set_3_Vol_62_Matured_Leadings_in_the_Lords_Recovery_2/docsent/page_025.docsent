   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Scripture Reading:Exo 4:2-9, 17</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A song of repentance:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My heart by mighty grace compelled</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Surrenders all to Thee;</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Against Thy terrors long I strove,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But who can stand against Thy love?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Love conquers even me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And light'nings flash, to blast my soul,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I still had stubborn been;</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But mercy has my heart subdued,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A bleeding Savior I have viewed,</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And now I hate my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Come, take possession of Thine own,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For Thou hast set me free;</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Released from Satan's hard command,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>See all my powers waiting stand,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be employed by Thee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hymns, #434</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a hymn of repentance by John Newton.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although some people have used it as a gospel song, it remains a very useful hymn in the congregation of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Newton was born in 1725 in London, England.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His father was a seafaring man and was away from home most of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The responsibility of raising the children fell on the shoulders of his devout and loving mother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She always led John by the hand to kneel before God to pray and to consecrate himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She also taught him to read the Bible and to memorize the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the age of seven, his mother passed away from exhaustion and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a blow drove the young man into waywardness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the age of ten he followed his father and took to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He spent over twenty years as a wandering prodigal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At an early age he adopted a sailor's life of debauchery, drunkenness, and gambling.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He heard the gospel many times.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every time he heard it he remembered the face and teaching of his loving mother, and he was pricked in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But he was never able to pull himself out of the sea of iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later, he went to Africa and engaged in the slave trade.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A brawl broke out and resulted in his being sold as a slave instead.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was tormented and harassed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The sufferings in mind and body drove him to become a runaway, but the result was more whipping and imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A few years later, his father found him and paid a ransom for his release.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While on a ship on his way back home, he encountered a sudden storm.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that instant, the Lord answered his mother's prayer when she offered him to the Lord as a youth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The battering of the fierce storm warmed his cold heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tossing of the waves awakened his slumbering spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He recalled the sins and evil he had committed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The stories he heard from his loving mother in his youth about a loving Savior who is God's Beloved flashed back, including stories of the One who had shed His blood and died for him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What grace this was!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He could not help but call on the Lord's name aloud.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He prayed to God, repented for his sins, believed in the Lord, and accepted Jesus as His Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Soon after, he consecrated himself to God and served Him faithfully until he died.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He wrote many songs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From the many he wrote, we have selected this hymn of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is one of the best hymns on repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hell and God's punishment may be fearful to others, but they are not fearful to the writer of the song.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even though God can do so much to such a one, He does not threaten men with punishment but compels men to repentance with grace and love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people have entered the gate through believing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But Newton did more; he entered the gate through obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul's repentance was accompanied by humiliation and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The same can be said of Newton.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We sing this hymn now whenever someone has some hesitation in consecration.</S>
