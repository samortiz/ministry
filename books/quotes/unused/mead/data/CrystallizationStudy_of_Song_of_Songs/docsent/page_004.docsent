   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR A PERSONAL AND AFFECTIONATE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear saints, in this message I want to impress you with something particular.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After you have received Christ as your life, you must have a very personal seeking after Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one can represent you or do anything for you in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It must be personal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every believer's relationship with Christ must be personal and affectionate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God works in a personal and affectionate way, not in the way of a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mao Tse-tung gained the people of China by a movement, not by personal contact and affection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even many in Christianity like to use the term movement.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some say that at John Wesley s time in Oxford there was a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They also say that there was a great movement, a great revival, in Wales at the beginning of this century.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This concept of having a movement is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not want to have a movement in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person can be moved to join a movement and not have any personal contact with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Recently, we have stressed that God became a man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although many responded to this truth, I was not very happy, because this response was a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to practice such a high truth, we need the personal and affectionate experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since we have been born of God, we have become His children John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since God is Spirit and we were born of Him, what are we?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That which is born of a cow, is a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That which is born of Chinese, is Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Also, that which is born of God as the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is logical.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A paraphrased version of John 3:6 could read this way: He that is born of God the Spirit is the spirit-God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We were regenerated of God as the Spirit to be a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As those who have been born of God, we are the children of God, the same as God in life and nature but not in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, our relationship with God has to be personal and affectionate.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In these days I feel very much that there is a warm, intimate, close affection between me and my God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The seeker said, Draw me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She did not say, Draw us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Draw me is personal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We want a drawing from the Lord that is His personal and affectionate doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We want Him to be with us in a personal and affectionate way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the religions, including Christianity, present a portrait of God which is inaccurate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They portray God merely as great, almighty, sovereign, majestic, and even unapproachable; no one can or even dares to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To say that God is majestic is not wrong, but that is only one attribute of the divine Being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regardless of how great, sovereign, almighty, and majestic God is, when He wanted to build up His relationship with man He took the personal, affectionate way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He took the way of becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the Lord Jesus had come to Peter in a majestic way, Peter would have felt threatened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But He did not come to Peter as the majestic, untouchable God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, He came to Peter as his countryman.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter was a Galilean, and Jesus was also a Galilean.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is personal and affectionate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus lived among men for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was the way in which God came to build up His relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the personal, affectionate way recorded in the New Testament from the incarnation to the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the morning of His resurrection, the Lord's empty tomb was discovered by three sisters Mark 16:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When they entered into the tomb, an angel gave them a message from the Lord, saying, Go, tell His disciples and Peter v. 7 . Peter's name mentioned in this way is personal and affectionate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter's intimate relationship with the Lord Jesus was particular, so it was stressed even by the angel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the beginning of his contact with the Lord, Peter's response was not too personal, but gradually Peter's transaction with the Lord became personal and affectionate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The apostle John could lie on the Lord's bosom John 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How personal and affectionate that was!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The very God, the very Lord whom we seek, sets up a feast and invites us to feast with Him Rev 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must have such a personal and affectionate contact with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we mail someone a letter, that affects him in a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if we come to him with a personal visitation and an affectionate contact, that makes a great difference.</S>
