   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE PURPOSE OF THE ELDERS'</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONTACT WITH PEOPLE 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:3-5, 31; Gal 6:1; Eph 3:8; Col 1:28; John 4:15</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen in the previous chapter, the elders must be apt to contact people and must build up the habit of contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders must be interested in people and have much concern for them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we shall fellowship concerning the purpose of the elders' contact with people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is related to the God-ordained way to meet and to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The God-ordained way is firstly to fulfill the New Testament priesthood of the gospel, that is, to bear the burden to spread the gospel to get sinners saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, it is to feed the young ones and to raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must not only feed the new ones but also raise them as we would raise a family.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lastly, the God-ordained way is to train the new ones to prophesy for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CONTACTING PEOPLE IN ORDER TO GAIN THEM</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FOR THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is to gain people for the increase of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 28:19 says, "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To disciple the nations is not merely to help sinners to have their sins forgiven and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is to bring them into the kingdom, making them citizens of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also the feeding and the raising up of the new members of the Body of Christ John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we gain people and disciple them into the kingdom, we have to feed them and raise them up as the new members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to endeavor to feed the new ones and raise them up, so that they may be the practical members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also the perfecting of the saints Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To perfect the saints is to train and equip them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After a young person graduates from high school, he must learn a trade or go to college.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To learn a trade or a skill is to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all must be impressed that each one among us has a special spiritual "trade."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The new ones must be saved, nourished, and raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the same time, they need to be trained to pick up a spiritual trade.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may say that every member of our physical body has a "trade."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When a baby is born, he has all his members, but the members do not all function skillfully.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They have not learned their trade.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While a mother cares for her child, she trains him, and after a number of years, all his members function properly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what it means to be perfected and equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The purpose of the elders' contact with people is also for the building up of the organic Body of Christ through prophesying 1 Cor 14:3-5, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some among the elders may say that to carry out the above points is too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, they should not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spiritual, divine life within us has an unlimited capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we will exercise, we will learn our spiritual trade and will have the ability to carry out the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, without exercise we will not be able to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A young lady may not have been taught how to cook or to raise children, but after being married for a while, she can learn to cook and eventually learn how to raise a family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She picks up these skills by practicing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the same way, learning to be a proper elder is a matter of exercise and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The elders in a local church may feel that they are not adequate to be proper elders.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, if they are faithful for a period of time, they will learn much.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we exercise, our capacity is manifested and developed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we will know how to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Developing our capacity may be illustrated by the acquiring of an education in school.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In society a young person needs eighteen or more years of education.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After graduation from high school, a person may study for four more years in college and then several more years for an advanced degree.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be educated in this way is to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have the capacity to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, we need education and practice to develop our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even making mistakes is an education for the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more mistakes the elders make, the more they will learn.</S>
