Rather, we will deal with practice, speaking much about the details of the experiences of the different stages of the Christian life
According to the Scriptures, God's intention is to be life to us in His Son, Christ the Lord, and through His Spirit
At the end of the Scriptures, in Revelation 22, we again see the tree of life in the very center of the New Jerusalem
At least one book, the Gospel of John, clearly tells us that Christ came that we may have life and may have it abundantly
To my awareness, there has been only one significant book concerning life in recent times, The Saving Life of Christ by Major Ian Thomas
It may be right to speak of the life of Christ, but people may understand that the life of Christ is one matter and Christ is another
Someone may say that the way to be regenerated is to accept Christ or to receive Christ into our heart, but how do we receive Christ?
We may compare this to fishing: We need to know what kind of fish we are after in order to choose the right kind of bait
In this case we need to approach him in the highest way, telling him, 'In order to have a certain morality, you need a certain kind of life
We may create an appetite in him by illustrating: 'If a flower has a poor life, it can never bring forth a better flower
After confessing his sins, a person must believe, that is, he must open his heart from the depths of his being to receive Christ into him
We should stress to this person that he must have a personal contact with Christ, saying, 'Although you cannot see Him, He is here
Just as the only way to contact the air is by breathing, the only way to contact Christ as God, our Savior, the living Spirit, is to pray'
If this person asks how he should pray, we can say, 'To pray is simply to speak something to Christ from your heart
After we give a person this kind of instruction, we need to give him some verses from the Scriptures, such as John 3:16
In summary, the way to receive Christ as our life is to repent, realizing that we are sinful and under God's condemnation
Someone may owe a person a thousand dollars, but if he does not put that into writing, there is no assurance that it will be paid
You realized that you need Him, and you opened yourself to Him, prayed to Him, and told Him that you receive Him
To not do this is like wrapping something up but not tying a knot around it; what we wrapped will come loose again
We need to learn how to help one like this by reading some passages that tell him that his sins have been borne by Christ
In this way we will cause him to realize that Christ bore all his sins and that God is now willing and ready to forgive him
There is no need to ask the new one, 'Have you ever done something wrong to your parents, or have you ever stolen anything'?
Meyer asked that person, 'When was the last time you made a confession to someone or cleared up your sins with others'?
Over such a long period of time, after many testimonies, only one or two persons' consecrations were proven to be real
After someone consecrates himself, he must learn to follow the inner consciousness, to follow the Spirit and walk in the Spirit
In Taiwan we had a large number of new converts, perhaps two hundred, so we would have a series of meetings after their baptism
In one week we would have six or seven meetings in a series in which we stressed these matters for their realization and experience
We praise the Lord that beginning in 1922 the Lord raised up a testimony in China to make these things very definite and practical
If someone knows the practical way, he can make a cake in a few minutes, and in another few minutes he can make another dish
We can find books on justification, forgiveness, and redemption, but it is hard to find a book dealing with regeneration
Forgiveness, justification, cleansing, redemption, and in one aspect, sanctification, are all for regeneration
Many Christians think that they know what God's salvation is, but most have neglected the aspect of regeneration
According to the teaching of the New Testament, God's salvation is first composed of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
Many people in Christianity speak of being redeemed from sin, from Satan, or from hell, but this is not correct
We were under the condemnation and curse of the law according to its requirements, so God had to pay something to fulfill its requirements
Ephesians 17 also speaks of redemption through His blood and 1 Peter 118 and 19 say that we were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ
God can forgive only those people whom He has redeemed; therefore, redemption comes first and then forgiveness
Ephesians 1:7 says, 'In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace'
It says, 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
After we receive the Lord Jesus and are sprinkled with the blood, we are sanctified, that is, separated from all the people of the world
Based on this blood we are forgiven, and by this blood we are cleansed and even separated, that is, sanctified
Man became fallen dirty and condemned by God so he needed to be sprinkled redeemed forgiven cleansed sanctified justified and reconciled
Even if Adam had never fallen and had remained in the garden of Eden in a good condition, he still would need to be regenerated
Otherwise, even though he would be a good man, he would have only the created, human life, not the uncreated, divine, eternal life
By this we have the second life, the divine, eternal life of God, and this life causes us to have the second birth
As long as we have faith, regardless of how big or little it is, even if it is smaller than a mustard seed, we have Christ dwelling in us
God is the greatest One, Christ is the strongest, most powerful One , and the Holy Spirit is the most living One
There is no need for regulations against going to Las Vegas to gamble, because we Christians do not have this taste
In the same way, we can fall into gambling, but this is not our practice because we have the divine nature within us
After sisters go to the department store and buy worldly items, they are not joyful because those things are not sweet to their taste
An apple tree bears apples and a peach tree bears peaches because they have different lives with different laws
God the Father is in God the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the very essence of the divine life
The law of life comes from the life with the nature, and the anointing is the moving and acting of the Triune God in the Spirit
The three of the Triune God are life to us with His nature, so we have the law of life and the anointing as something so living in us
We must realize that we are big persons, for all the spiritual riches with the fullness of the Godhead are in us
The old creation was made by God's hand, but the new creation is something of regeneration with God Himself as life
God is not mingled with the old creation, while in the new creation God Himself as life is mingled with the creature
If a child is born of someone, he has the life of that person as the right and authority to be that person's child
We can go on to grow in a proper way in the spiritual life and develop in what we have received and in what we have become
The New Testament clearly teaches and deals with our need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord after we are saved
For regeneration alone, there is no need for consecration, but if we do not consecrate ourselves after regeneration, we will be frustrated
Smith and her husband, among others, began what became the Keswick Convention in England in the second half of the nineteenth century
There is no doubt that at that time, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, consecration was the main item of the Lord's recovery
Consecration is like the entrance to a building; if we do not pass through the entrance, it is impossible to go anywhere in the building
In order to experience the riches of Christ typified by the things in the tabernacle, we need to pass through the crisis of consecration
In order to have the real Christian life and the real church life, we all must learn day by day to live a life of consecration
The gate of the spiritual things related to life is regeneration; for the life within we need the gate of regeneration
Although they are regenerated persons, they do not live as regenerated persons; that is, they have the life but not the living
He would point out something in each testimony that proved that the consecration was not genuine, absolute, complete, or without reservation
The way to check whether or not we are faithful and honest in our consecration to the Lord is by our daily life
The way to check whether or not our consecration is complete, genuine, and without reservation is by who wins the struggle
We need to pray, fellowship, and encourage the brothers and help them one by one to come into the real experience of consecration
The unfaithfulness to our consecration is the reason why many of us have not grown much and advanced on the Lord's way
We may come to the meetings, fellowship with the saints, and do many things in the Christian life, but we may not be on the proper way
If we struggle with the Lord and win, causing the Lord to be defeated, we are weak, and we lose the power to bring people to the Lord
If we always take the ground of consecration and go on step by step, we have the power to bring people to the Lord
As we have said, the crisis of consecration is the key to our other experiences, and it is a life-long, not once-for-all, experience
It is entirely right that as Christians we should consecrate ourselves every morning and again in the evening after the day's duties
If he is a regenerated person, however, the most important thing is to help him one way or another to consecrate himself
A person may pray to the Lord seek His mercy and obtain His mercy but if he is not consecrated these are not the real experiences of life
In order to help someone in this way, we must pray for him to find one way or another to bring him through the crisis of consecration
Of course, the way we take depends on the Lord's leading at the time, but our fellowship will usually be in one of several ways
Someone may have love for a brother, for example, but after working with him for a year he no longer has a fresh sense of love
Before praying, many people do not have the sincerity to consecrate themselves, but after they pray, their consecration becomes real
In the types we can see that whether or not a person was sincere in offering something on the altar, the Lord accepted it
Some brothers and sisters were not sincere before they prayed, but after they prayed they became sincere, consecrated ones
There is no account in the Scriptures in which a person brought something to the altar, then repented, and the thing came back to him
Someone may still remember the place, the time, and the persons he was with when he offered himself to the Lord
Even after twenty years that word still remained with him, and he had no peace until the Lord caused him to keep his word of consecration
The best way to help him is to pray, not in a general way but by calling on the Lord as the highest authority to deal with this person
He will answer this call to the highest authority and come in to intervene and deal with the person for whom we pray
It is right to take a certain period of time in a local church to deal with the stages of spiritual experience
They know what consecration is, they have this experience, they live in it, and they know how to help new converts to go on
The believers will have not merely a certain desire or love but the experience of life the genuine learning the discipline and the practice
God has many things to put into us and many things to remove, but this requires our cooperation, which is our consecration
We need the Lord's work to clean us out and remove the many things other than Christ, and we need Him to put Christ into us more and more
And there in various groups of Christians, people talk about life, but life is often just a term or an '-ology'
If we do know the fellowship of life, the sense or taste of life, and the law of life, then we know what life is in our experience
The Gospel of John is a book on life, showing how to have and receive life, while the First Epistle of John is on the fellowship of life
After we receive the eternal life in Christ, that is, Christ as our life, we need to pay attention to the fellowship of life
Other passages speak of the fellowship of the Spirit, such as 2 Corinthians 13:14, but John speaks of the fellowship of life
Horizontally we fellowship with one another, and vertically we fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ
Acts 242 says And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles in the breaking of bread and the prayers
Four things are mentioned here, but according to the grammatical construction, only two things are of the apostles
Among the saints there is only one fellowship because there is only one life, one source of life, one Lord of life, Christ Himself
The Lord Christ is the unique source of this unique life, so from this unique life we have the unique fellowship
There are many members in our body, yet they have one life, and in that one life the entire body has one fellowship
The flow of the blood in our body is the blood itself, just as the current of electricity is the electricity itself
In the same way, the fellowship of life is the flowing, the current, of life within us; it is life itself flowing
After we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we must care for this inner flowing, because consecration is for life
The kind of teeth that come from the flow of life function properly, but teeth inserted from the outside do not work
All the precious experiences of Romans 6, 8, and 12 depend on the flowing of life within, that is, on the fellowship of life
If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
If we are in the fellowship, we must be in the light, because the fellowship brings us into the presence of God who is light
When we are in the fellowship and the fellowship brings us into the presence of God, who is light, we are in the light
By the sprinkling of the blood and the anointing of the ointment, this person or this item of furniture is acceptable to God
These two things-the sprinkling of the blood and the anointing of the ointment-bring people into the presence and fellowship of God
According to typology, this inner anointing comes to us based on the sprinkling of the blood; that is, the anointing follows the blood
More cleansing of the blood brings us into more anointing, and the more anointing we enjoy, the more we have life
It will not be an outward adjustment, correction, or improvement, which is the work of religion, and not the working of the inner life
In order to know life and in order to describe what life is in the way of experience, we must describe it in the way of fellowship
They walk in the vanity of their mind because in their mind they do not have God; they do not have Christ who is the reality
That they are alienated from the life of God means that they do not have the life of God; they are cut off from the life of God
By all these verses we must conclude that in order to know the spirit of our mind we must know the inner consciousness of life
It is by the inner consciousness of life, the inner, deeper feeling of life, that we know the spirit of our mind
We would all agree that peace refers to a certain feeling within us, something within that can be sensed, of which we have a consciousness
We speak of the sense of life rather than the spiritual sense because this sense is one hundred percent related to life
Many of us have been in Christianity for many years, but sorry to say, all these precious matters have been lost and buried there
Spiritual seeing, spiritual knowledge, and spiritual understanding are the spiritual sense, the spiritual feeling
The inner life, which is the Lord Jesus Himself, enlightens us within, and by this enlightening we have the inner sense
We know this because we sense it, and we sense it because we have the life of the Lord Jesus shining within us
Strictly speaking, the inner law is the inner sense, or at least we can say that the inner sense comes from the inner regulating
On the one hand, this is the regulating of the inner law, but on the other hand, it is the inner sense of life
Now we need to work out the salvation that we have already received, which means to live it out, by obedience with fear and trembling
Verse 13 continues, 'For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure'
We must be obedient not merely to outward teachings and doctrines but to the working of God within us both to will and to do
It is by this obedience to the inner working of God that we work out, live out, the salvation that we have received
Even while you sleep, you may repeat, 'The light of life, the law of life, the anointing, Christ lives in me, God operates in me'
We must consecrate ourselves once again read all the related passages of the Scriptures put ourselves on the test and practice these things
In the Old Testament type, anything or anyone brought into the presence of God needed to be sprinkled with the blood and anointed
Look into all these points, read all the passages, pray about them, meditate a little, and put them into practice
After we receive the Lord Jesus as our life, we have three main things: the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life
Verse 10 is a quotation of Jeremiah 31:33, but in Jeremiah law is single in number, while in Hebrews it is not one law but laws
We are speaking of the law not according to the human way, thought, and understanding but according to the scriptural meaning
Today, just as the people of Israel in the ancient time, the believers are the people of God, who need to be regulated
According to the proper understanding, the law is God Himself, or using the scriptural term, the law is the testimony of God
In the Old Testament the ark was called the Ark of the Testimony, and the tabernacle was called the Tabernacle of the Testimony
We may compare it to a document that describes a certain person, telling us his size, hair color, and other features
Because the law is the testimony, description, and 'photograph' of God, we can say that the law is God Himself
Many of us can recite the Ten Commandments, but we still may not know what kind of God the commandments describe
God is also omnipresent, transcendent, and great, but these attributes are not the regulation of the walk of God's people
There is no need to be regulated by God's transcendence or greatness, so these attributes are not found in the Ten Commandments
Rather, the walk of God's people must be regulated by four attributes of God-holiness, righteousness, love, and light
It is different from certain Chinese and Japanese laws, from which we realize that they were worshippers of idols
The law made by God is a description, definition, and testimony of God Himself, testifying what kind of God He is
In order to be the people of God, our walk and daily living must be regulated by and correspond to these four attributes
On the one hand, the law testified and described God, but on the other hand, it also demanded the people to correspond to God's attributes
If we do something in the nature of love, light, holiness, and righteousness we have the taste from God that consents and agrees with us
Whatever corresponds with Him gives us a good taste, but if there is anything against His nature, the taste protests
Since God put Himself into us as the law, giving us a taste and regulating us in all things, there is no need for anyone to teach us
Verse 11 begins, 'And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord'
In the ancient times God was God to the people of Israel, and they were a people to Him, according to the Ten Commandments
God can be God to us and we a people to God only according to this law, not according to the good things we do
In the morning you have to love, and at night you have to love; yesterday you had to love, and today you still have to love
There is no need to seek the Lords guidance as to whether or not we should love a person because this is something according to Gods nature
Again, we cannot find in the regulation of the law whether or not to go to a certain place and do certain things
In the same way, we have the law of life within as the regulation, and we also have the anointing of the Holy Spirit within as the guidance
As to which barber shop to go to or whether to let a brother cut our hair is a matter of the inner anointing not something of the inner law
As far as the attributes of God are concerned, we need the regulation, but as far as the move of God is concerned, we need the guidance
The three things we have spoken about-the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life-are matters of the spiritual life
The fellowship of life, of course, is a matter of fellowship, and it is related to the fellowship of the spirit
The sense of life is a matter of the inner knowledge, and this inner knowledge is related to the intuition of the spirit
We will know life in a practical way, and we will be able to help people to experience Christ as life in the spirit
We will have fellowship with God in harmony with our inner sense, because we are always going along with the law of life
If we do not know the law of life, the sense of life, and the fellowship of life, we do not know the inner life
We may know it in terms, in letter, in word, on paper, and in knowledge and teaching, but we do not know it in practicality
It is only in the last few years that the Lord has guided us to pay attention to this term, which also appears in Psalm 51:6
By this we can realize that inward parts refers to the parts of the soul, because the mind is one part of the soul
By comparing Hebrews 810 with Jeremiah 3133 we realize that the inward parts are the parts of the soul of which the mind is the leading part
In chapter eight the mind is first and then the heart, but in chapter ten the heart is first and then the mind
To engrave is to write by cutting or carving, and to inscribe is to cut in, to write not with an ink pen but with a knife
Even with physical things, the only way for something to be worked into us is that we take it as our life supply
Without comprehending this central thought, we can never understand the Bible; we will not know what this book is talking about
There is also a deeper function, which is the intuition, the direct sense within our spirit, for us to sense something of God
In this case we become dull, we are in darkness, and we cast off all feeling, becoming a person without regulation
We may still be very good and moral, but we are merely keeping the moral laws; there is no inner regulation of life
The worldly, moral persons act only according to outward regulations, but we Christians walk according to the inward regulation
Whatever he does must be something of life, something as the working out of the inner life, not merely an outward behavior
In principle, the law is the regulating of the being of God's people by God Himself, or rather, by what God is
If God were a God of hatred and murder, we would have to live in the way of hatred and murder people day by day
One way is to paint a picture of God, that is, to write down a description of what He is, and put it before us
The other way is that God Himself-the living law, not the written law; the real person, not the picture-comes into us
The old law was a picture a photograph a description of God presented to us outwardly according to which we should live walk and do things
From the first day we were saved, there was a change in our understanding, our thinking, and our way to consider things
The tripartite man has a human spirit as his center, a soul surrounding it, and a body as the environment for it
We may call this an influence from God being life in our spirit, but God calls it the putting of His law within us
Their minds have never been refined and renewed because their minds have never been regulated by God's inscribing
The building cannot proceed in a successful way simply because the emotions of the dear saints have not been dealt with and renewed by God
If you say the earth is heaven, they will say, 'Yes, it is heaven,' but if you say it is the earth, they will say, 'Yes, it is the earth'
When they initiate something, they feel it is right, but if others initiate it, they say no to it, even if it is the same thing
The problem is that for many years after we were saved, we did not cooperate with God to let Him inscribe His law on our mind and will
If the brothers' mind, emotion, and will have been renewed by God's inscribing, we will see the real growth in them
One law becomes many laws, just as the one river in Genesis 2:10 was parted into four streams in four directions
If we learn the lesson to cooperate with God to let Him inscribe on our mind, will, and emotion, there is no need to seek victory over sin
Our measure of Christ depends on how much God inscribes on our mind, will, and emotion, how much God works Himself into us
The more we have the fellowship of life, the more we will have the sense of life, and the sense will be deeper
The more God inscribes on us, the more He transforms us into His image, the more we will be like Him and have His likeness
Since there was no prophet to help Joseph, the husband of Mary, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, 'Flee to Egypt'
As a Christian walking in the presence of God and living by Christ, can we say something dirty and evil with our mouth?
When we contact people and speak for the Lord, however, what we say is not a matter of regulating but a matter of guidance
In the same way, if we are not clear about the inner regulation, we can never be clear about the inner guidance
John 2:27 tells us that since the anointing abides in us and teaches us concerning all things, we have no need that anyone teach us
Similarly, Hebrews 8:11 tells us that since the law of life regulates within us, there is no need to teach our brother to know the Lord
Verse 10 also tells us that God is God to us by this inner regulating, and we are a people to God also according to the inner regulating
The way to do this is in three aspects: We must know the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life
These three items are all related to the inner life, and this inner life is nothing other than the Lord Himself
What we mean by God's economy is that God the Father works in the Son, and the Son comes into us as the Spirit
When we say that the Spirit dwells in us today, we mean that the three persons of the one Godhead work together within us as life
God is life to us in our human spirit, and in our spirit there are three functions: the fellowship, the intuition, and the conscience
The law tells us what to do and what not to do, and the conscience checks us concerning what is right and what is wrong
We do have this term and we do realize that Christs name means the Anointed One but the inner anointing has been almost entirely neglected
As we have pointed out, the Old Testament was called the law and the prophets, because at that time there were these two main ministries
The ministry of the prophets covered more than the ministry of the law, because the prophets' ministry included the law
Because the anointing is so inclusive, we must use many words to describe it: operating, working, moving, acting, and energizing
Luke 4:18a, as a quotation from Isaiah 61:1 says, 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me'
In addition, Hebrews 1:9, quoting Psalm 45:7, says, 'God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners'
On the day Christ was anointed by God, the Spirit of God descended like a dove and came upon Him, not in part but as a whole
Without the Spirit, God the Father and God the Son could not reach us, because the Spirit is the final person in the Godhead
For God the Father to reach us, He has to reach us in the Spirit, and for God the Son to reach us, He has to reach us as the Spirit
It is in the Spirit, through the Spirit, with the Spirit, and by the Spirit that the Father in the Son reaches us
When God paints us anoints us with Himself whatever He is becomes our element and His essence and substance become our essence and substance
Rather, the Lord will answer this prayer neither in English nor in Chinese, but with 'paint'; He will simply paint him
In a peculiar way, we may dream about whether or not to go to the movies, but God may never tell us His will concerning movies
That is right, but we all know that this kind of speaking is not in clear words, neither in Chinese nor English, nor in letters
After a month of being anointed, the problem that troubles a brother is gone, and the anointing is mingled with him
God's glory, splendor, and His divine 'color' and 'odor' still remain divine, but now they are in a human form
In 1922 or 1923, a brother said that whenever he prayed in his room, there was a voice in the corner of the ceiling speaking to him
He reminded them that the Lord said, 'But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one'
The New Testament principle is that God does not speak to us in plain words, in speech, but by anointing, by painting
As we have pointed out many times, God's purpose, God's economy, is to work Himself into us to make Himself one with us
God's way to make Himself one with us is to be life within us, so that we may take Him and experience Him as our life
When you put what you have heard into practice, you will truly learn it, and it will be so practical and living to you
No doubt, the fellowship of life, the sense of life, the law of life, and the anointing within us are very subjective
You will know if it is right or not, and if you are an expert, you can realize what part is wrong just by listening to the sound'
Otherwise, we may feel that something is wrong in our head or feet and say there is a problem with our kidneys
Some things people say are nonsense, because they do not know the inner parts of the person; they do not know what they have within them
The first thing we touch when we come to a building is the entrance; we have to find a way to get through the entrance
The two easiest ways to preach the gospel are to preach concerning God's love and to preach concerning people's sins
When the mind is enlightened, the emotions are stirred up, and the conscience is convicted, a person makes the decision to believe
We need these four steps: the mind enlightened, the emotion stirred up, the conscience convicted, and the will submissive
The first steps of God's dealing with us as believers are that our mind is renewed and our emotion is stirred up to love Him
In 1 Kings 39 Solomon asks Give therefore to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people and to discern between good and evil
In the parable of the sower in Matthew 13 the seed is sown in the heart but if someone does not understand the word Satan snatches it away
We have the fellowship of life, the sense of life, and the law of life within, and we have the anointing of the Triune God within us
If we deal with our mind, emotion, conscience, and will, we will have a proper heart, and it will be a useful entrance for God
We will have a good dealing with the Lord, and we will allow Him to have the ground and the way to deal with us in a proper way
Practice to be clear in your mind, love the Lord with your emotion, have a right conscience, and be softened in your will
When we pray, we will see that our will is not only hardened but stubborn, so we need to pray for our will to be softened
Many Christians today read these words in the New Testament, but they do not know why there is so much stress on these four matters
If our heart is not ready and right with God, there is no way for God to deal with us, and there is no way for us to grow
It is these four matters-the mind is clear, the emotion is loving, the conscience is right, and the will is soft
In order for the heart to be proper, the mind must be clear, enlightened, and transformed; it must be as crystal, transparent and not opaque
It is hard to find a verse that tells us what the source of the conscience is, where it came from, and how it came into function
In Gods creation the conscience was there already but its function was not there before the fall of man its function was not yet developed
Bible students agree that the first of the so-called seven dispensations was the dispensation of innocence, the dispensation without sin
As we have seen, the heart comprises all three parts of the soul and one function of the spirit, the conscience
When we confess, we have both a contrite heart and a contrite spirit, because the conscience is a part both of the heart and of the spirit
Not only did we need to repent at the time we heard the gospel, but even after we are saved we have to repent continually
The apostle Paul said that he exercised himself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men
He also said that the Christian life is a life of love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith
Before the fall man lived in the presence of God and was directly under the government of God, so there was no need for the conscience
If we are fallen under human government still needing others to govern us at school at home and in our city we are fallen to the uttermost
If a student still needs the government of the school, he is either not saved or not saved properly and adequately
If one has been saved adequately, there is no need for this kind of human government, because he has been saved back to his conscience
There should be no need for human government to rule us, because we are under the government of the conscience
If we are not pure in our conscience, if our conscience is not void of offense, it is very hard to live in the presence of God
God's salvation is to bring us back from human government to the conscience and then through the conscience into His presence
The function of the conscience is threefold: to know what is right and wrong, to justify or to accuse, and to govern for God
Ephesians 4:19 says, 'Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness'
Their fellowship is killed and their intuition is deadened, but our fellowship and intuition have been made alive
To be governed by the presence of the Lord, however, is to be governed not according to right and wrong but according to something deeper
If we intend to know the inner life and we mean business to live in the inner life, we must know the conscience
The purpose of these messages is not only for you to know and understand these things, but also to help you to help others
As we have also seen, there are three kinds of government: the divine government, the government of the conscience, and the human government
Whether unconsciously or unwillingly, we are under either the divine government, the conscience, or human government
Whenever there is something wrong either with God, with man, or even with ourselves, our conscience condemns us
Whenever we have condemnation, we must deal with it by confessing and by applying the cleansing of the redeeming blood
If, however, we do not deal with the condemnation but rather live in it, it will become an offense and a blame within us
To say that a sister is sensitive is not a good description, but for a brother to be keen is a good qualification
The worldly people and even the Christians who do not seek the Lord and walk in spirit are careless in their feeling
After we are saved in a proper way, however, there is the consciousness in our conscience that we cannot tell lies
Right after we are saved, we know not to tell lies, but we may still have some freedom to speak certain other things
After we love the Lord, seek Him, and learn to walk in the spirit, the ruling, reigning, and governing in our conscience becomes stricter
We not only do not have the freedom to tell lies, but we also do not have the freedom to speak whatever we want to speak
It may seem that we have to say something, but we may have the sense to be careful, that to say something is wrong, so we do not say it
When we do not say it, however, we may still have the sense that we need to say it; to not say it is also wrong
It is easy to have a conscience too dull or too sensitive, but it is rather hard to keep our conscience always so keen
They have the thought that the idols are awful and that we should not have anything to do with the things associated with the idols
The apostle Paul told us that for some believers to eat the things offered to idols is right, but for others to eat the same things is wrong
The one person is grown and has adequate knowledge, so he has a strong conscience, but the other person is still young
We must differentiate between the condemnation of the conscience itself and the accusation of the enemy on the conscience
The condemnation of the conscience is right and normal, but the accusation of the enemy on the conscience is not only abnormal but wrong
As to the condemnation of the conscience itself we must deal with it but as to the accusation of Satan on our conscience we must reject it
If it is a fact that we have done something wrong that we are wrong with God with others or with ourselves our conscience will condemn us
We may have done nothing wrong, and we cannot find that we are wrong in anything, yet there is a certain accusation in our conscience
It is very easy for those who seek the Lord diligently to be attacked by the enemy, to be accused by him in their conscience
If we do not seek the Lord, we are careless and indifferent Christians, and we do not have the problem of accusation
When we start to seek the Lord, and the more we try to walk in the spirit and fellowship with the Lord, we will have all these problems
We must learn to reject it; otherwise, we will be frustrated and bothered day after day, and we will be damaged
John 1:9 says that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
We have to go on, but in our seeking, going on, and following Him, there are dangers, so we must learn about them
If we leave the condemnation there it becomes an offense and if we accept the accusation of Satan on our conscience it will become an attack
If, on the other hand, there is nothing wrong, but we have an accusation, we must be bold to tell the enemy that we do not accept it
On the other hand, this new one does not have the growth of life, the stage and degree of life, to follow up on the knowledge
After you pray, if you feel it is the Lord's grace that you give up this thing, then give it up by the grace of the Lord'
On the other side, the other sisters should not follow the first sister simply because they heard her testimony
When we grow in the Lord, we gain an amount of knowledge to realize that we must deal with the Lord about certain things
Whenever there is the proper knowledge of the conscience that comes from the enlightenment of the spirit, the supply of grace always follows
Whenever we have the realization in our conscience to deal with certain things, we must know there is always the supply of grace to come
Romans 12:2a says, 'And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
Whether or not we can put off the old man and put on the new man depends on the renewing in the spirit of our mind
Corinthians 10:4 says, 'For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds'
The Lord Jesus told them not only that He was going to be killed but also that He would be raised from the dead
Verses 22 and 23 continue, 'And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord!
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
The mind has something to do with the things of God, with God's interests, and it also has something to do with Satan
Verses 25 and 26 say, 'For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it
Again, self is the soul, the soul is the self, and the soul, or the self, is related to Satan and is one with Satan
If our mind is set on the side of God, then we are one with God, but if our mind is set on the side of Satan, we are one with Satan
Verse 18 says, 'He brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures'
Verse 15 of chapter three says, 'This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but is earthly, soulish, demonic'
If you will spend more time to read them and pray about them, the Holy Spirit will give you a clear vision of the inner life
The history of the human race is a history of the fall, but one day, after four thousand years of this history, the Lord Jesus came to man
The learned ones-the Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes, priests, and lawyers-were all very thoughtful, clever people
The first step fallen people must take in order to contact God and have a godly, right relationship with Him is to turn their mind
His work on the sixth day was very good because on the sixth day God created man, and man in the eyes of God was very good
The Lord rose up and rebuked the winds and the sea, because in the wind were the wicked spirits and in the sea were the demons
It is very hard, however, to deal with a person who is taken over in his mind by the evil spirits with all kinds of thoughts and doctrine
In China the most difficult people to deal with in gospel preaching were those learned ones who followed the teachings of Confucius
Those teachings were good teachings, but Satan utilized those thoughts to take over the minds of those learned people
Those teachings became the veil over their mind, so that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ could not shine into their hearts
Brother Watchman Nee once said that if you do not want a thought, but it keeps coming, that proves that it is not your thought
Even brothers who are very faithful to the Lord cannot withstand the attacks if they expose their mind to the air
The more he considers in this way, the more Satan does his best to attack his mind and turn it to something other than the Lord
Sometimes Satan would attack the mind of a husband toward his wife, or he may attack his mind concerning another brother or other matters
We will meet the Lord; spontaneously our mind will be renewed, and gradually our whole being, our soul, will be transformed
James 3:8 says, 'But the tongue no one among men is able to tame; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison'
Many times when people talk with me-both believers and unbelievers-I just look to the Lord, saying, 'Lord, cover me'
When we have a real repentance, turning our mind to the Lord, this turning of the mind will silence our tongue
If we have something to say, it will be something of the Lord, something bringing life rather than death, something full of life, not death
Our mind will be renewed, and the entire soul will be influenced; that is, it will be transformed, and our soul will be saved
By 2 Timothy 3:16 and John 6:63 we can realize that the word of God is simply the breathing of God as the Spirit
Because we have a body, we need physical food, but besides the body we also have a spirit, so we need spiritual food
We need to take the word of God, not as mere knowledge, instruction, or teachings, but as food, not as the 'menu' but as the 'dinner'
If we do not know how to eat the word how can we enjoy it how can we have the gladness and joy in our heart for the word and with the word
When we find the Lord's words, we should not only know them but eat them, so that they become both the gladness and the joy
When we exercise our eyes as members of our body to read the word, spontaneously the mind of the soul understands it
Whether this Bible is a book of knowledge or a book of life to us depends on whether we exercise our mind or our spirit to contact it
If we exercise our spirit to contact the Bible, spontaneously it will be a book of life to constantly nourish us
Whenever we come to read the word, we first must realize that the Bible must be a book of life, not a book of knowledge
We must thoroughly, clearly realize that the Bible is food to us rather than knowledge, so we come to it not for knowledge but to be fed
It is easy to use a chapter such as 1 John 1, so for our illustration we can select a more difficult chapter, such as Titus 2
She may turn to chapter two and read verse 1: 'But you, speak the things which are fitting to the healthy teaching'
She is impressed concerning loving her husband and her children, so right away she puts these two items into prayer
When we deal with any commandment, we must deal with the Lord at the same time to make the Lord one with His word
As we have illustrated, a wife may have fought with her husband for many years, but then she becomes a Christian
It is not good enough that she keeps this word in her mind and makes the decision to keep the Lord's word from that day onward
We contact the Lord through this word and spend time with the Lord by taking this word, praying, praising, thanking, and looking to Him
In this way, it seems that we are taking the word into our mind, but even the more we are absorbing the Lord into us
In the same way, simply come to any corner of the 'supermarket' of the Bible and stretch out your hand, and you will get something
During this time simply read the word, understanding it spontaneously, but mostly spending your time in prayer
We have the promise that if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, our Father will take care of whatever we need
With this way, we will know the word better and more deeply, and we will enjoy it in a richer and more living way
During this half hour, do not pray for something else, such as the church, the gospel, the work, or the service
If we are open to the Lord in this way, the Holy Spirit will inspire us to pray, and He will give us the living utterance to pray
It is by this kind of prayer that we will absorb the Lord into us and apply the word as our spiritual nourishment that enables us to grow
We should spend half an hour with the Lord daily, not to pray for our needs, the church, the gospel, or the work, but to feed on His word
Second, every time we feed on the word we should sing a proper hymn that matches our prayer, our understanding, and our feeding
If we are open to the Lord the Holy Spirit will lead us to release our spirit and if the environment permits He will lead us to pray loudly
We will listen with a criticizing spirit; we will be killed, we will kill others, and we will spread much death
May the Lord be merciful to us and deliver us from seeking the knowledge of letters, that we may take the word as the nourishment of life
Simpler translations, such as the New American Standard Version, render the first phrase as, 'I rise before dawn'
Those who are bothered may not say anything, but their mentality is turning, and they ask, 'Is there no need to know the word?
Some say that the morning is the best time to come to the word and pray, while some say that the evening is better
In this also there is a balance; we need the evening to balance the morning and the morning to balance the evening
The Bibles of certain persons, however, especially of those who have a background of one-sided cooking, may have many notes and marks
They are unbalanced in another way, and they may need to exchange their Bible for a new, clean one with no notes and marks
They say that it is too much to carry both a Bible and a hymnal, but they themselves carry neither a Bible nor a hymnal
We may illustrate reading and feeding in this way: In order to eat, we must first go to the supermarket, buy the food, and then cook it
On the one hand, if we do not buy it, we will not have anything to eat; on the other hand, there is no point in buying it but not eating
On the Lord's Day, however, we can skip the reading of the chapter in the New Testament and just review what we read in the past six days
You may, for example, carry only the book of Genesis in your pocket, and while you are waiting for someone, open it and read a few chapters
To be tempted to do more does not help; it only causes us to be cooked too much on one side-to be burned on one side and raw on the other
If we understand something, we understand it, but if we do not, we do not; we should leave it and not spend too much time there
Many dear ones spend more time in reading secular writings, such as newspapers and magazines, than the holy Scriptures
If possible, we should buy Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible or Young's Analytical Concordance to the Bible
All the time we will be learning something, feeding on something, and growing in what we learn and in what we feed on
We will be cooked on both sides adequately properly and in a balanced way not like those who read the word in an unbalanced overcooked way
If we learn to deal with the word in this way, just consider what kind of marvelous, wonderful Christians we will be
We can tell them that starting on the following day they should eat the word, beginning, for example, with the Gospel of John
They should also stand in the meeting to give a testimony of how they have been feeding on the word and how they have been reading
Perhaps after half a year a few will come to say that there are many terms, phrases, and names in the Bible that they do not understand
In addition, though, we can give them Strong's Concordance as a gift, and after another half year we can give them Young's Concordance
Rather, she gives him the proper proportion daily, and after one, two, and eventually eighteen years, he grows up
We simply pray to breathe in the Lord, look unto Him, contact Him, praise Him, thank Him, and have a talk with Him
We should learn to forget about our needs and simply praise Him for His kindness, goodness, greatness, and for so many other aspects
We can talk with the Lord in any place, under any kind of circumstances, and with any kinds of terms, expressions, and utterances
Rather, if you will take this word as an instruction and put it into practice, you will see wonderful progress within only one month
In 1949 when we started the work in Taiwan, we printed forms related to these matters and gave them to the new converts to fill out
For anything to become a part of us, it has to be eaten and digested by us, and it even has to be mingled with us
Immediately after God's creation of man, He did not give many commandments to man, telling him to do this and not to do that
God put man in front of the tree of life to eat God Himself, to receive something of God into himself as his life
The record of the picture in Genesis 2 is very clear; there is no other way for God to be life to us other than by being food to us
In the New Testament we see that the Lord Jesus, who is the Word of God and God Himself, was one day incarnated to be a man
According to the Gospel of John, however, the Lord Jesus made it very clear that He came that we may have life and may have it abundantly
He simply reminds us to receive Him, love Him, and abide in Him-to feed on Him day by day as the small pieces of manna
Just in a recent period of about two weeks, we encountered more than five different kinds of Christian meetings
God created the earth and the heavens with billions of items so that man can exist on the earth in order to fulfill God's purpose
It is that God wants to put Himself into man as his content and reality, so that man will become His expression
Food and marriage are for God's central purpose, but Satan utilizes these things to distract people away from this purpose
The New Testament is for the central purpose of God, but Satan utilizes even this to distract people from Christ
When we speak of life, they nod their heads, but after the meeting we find out that they were nodding about something else
Chapter two tells us that the apostle did not determine to know anything among them except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified
The first parable in Matthew 13 has four aspects because it speaks of four kinds of hearts as the growing soil
Someone may be glad about God's testimony, God's message concerning Christ as life, but he is actually shallow
In the third aspect, the cares of this life, the lusts, and many worldly things become the thorns that choke the growth of the wheat
Eventually, there is the fourth aspect in which the seed is sown, it grows up, and it bears fruit thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold
In the second parable of Matthew 13, the descriptive word is not tares; we do not want to pay attention to the negative things
Do you think that the enemy, having done as much as he did to spoil seventy-five percent of the seed, will now go to sleep?
If you travel throughout the whole world to find mustard good for eating, you will see that there is almost none
Have we been frustrated by false Christians, either by our friendship with them or by following them in certain worldly ways?
Since Christ has been sown into us as life, there has been a great struggle between the Lord and the enemy, both around us and within us
Or perhaps the seed sown remains, but you may be a shallow, superficial person full of rocks and stones beneath
In addition, you may have friendships with imitation, artificial Christians, which may frustrate you from growing
In Shanghai, mostly under my hand, we built a meeting hall that could accommodate three thousand people inside and two thousand outside
After this we are transformed in our soul, and eventually at the Lord's coming we will be transfigured in our body
The first is to offer ourselves bodily for the Body, and the other is to be transformed by the renewing of the mind
In these two verses we can see that the building of the church depends on our real consecration and the transformation of the soul
Verse 18 says that we are being 'transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit'
As we have seen, in the parables of Matthew 13 there is the view of life, growth, and transformation to produce the building materials
In Matthew 13 and 1 Corinthians 3 we can see the consistency of the divine thought: Life is sown into us to grow and to cause transformation
A mother knows how to feed a baby to make him grow, but in the church today do we know how to help people to grow?
We praise the Lord, however, that He has brought many of these people to the point that they realize they need something
As long as they have the best organizing regulations and a strong, proper character for organizing, this so-called church will flourish
Peter 1:23 says that we have been 'regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
In chapter two he says that as newborn babes we need to grow, and by this growth we become living stones to be built up as a spiritual house
When we talk about gifts and tongues, people can understand, but they may not understand when we talk about growth in life and building
If we do not see the way to grow, to water others to help them to grow, to be built up, and to build up others, we have only doctrines
The more we show ourselves to be nice, the more the experts will say there is nothing precious within; it is all a show
We need Christ sown into us, and we need to grow in Christ in a normal, ordinary way, with nothing that is miraculously attractive
If we know how to sow grow build and be built up then we can experience the very Christ revealed in the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians
The secret of experiencing Christ is in the third chapter: to have Christ planted into us, to grow in Him, and to be built up in Him
The intention in sowing a seed into the earth is that the seed will grow up and bring forth something through its growth
We all must be very clear that God's intention is to put Christ as the seed of life into us in order to grow within us
People always try to give a certain kind of exposition and interpretation of those parables, but they neglect the simple thing
In addition, Matthew 13 shows us-as do several passages of the New Testament-that out of the growth comes transformation
Three things are basically important: the birth of life, the growth of life, and the maturity of life, from which we have transformation
We are the newborn babes who need to grow; then by this growth we are transformed into precious stones to be built up as a spiritual house
If we practice these, then not only are we in life but we are on the way of growth, and we also will know how to help others to grow
In Matthew 13 we are first told that after the seed is sown, the enemy, signified by the birds in the air, comes to snatch it away
In order to grow, we must go to the Lord to pray definitely and purposely that He will grant us a love for Him
The more we try, exercise, and endeavor by ourselves to overcome all the things that choke, the more we will be defeated
We will realize who is in the light of such a love, and those whom we contact will be influenced to love the Lord
Of the sixty-six books of the Bible, there is only one that deals entirely with the matter of growth, that is, the Song of Songs
If we do not have love, regardless of how much we consecrate ourselves, we still have not truly consecrated ourselves
After we begin to love the Lord, we must have a clear dealing with ourselves in order to have the real growth in life
Some even realize this, but they are not willing to make a confession, so to one degree or another they are frustrated
If we are not in the spirit, regardless of how much we speak, we can help people only in their mentality; we can never minister life to them
If we constantly have something accusing us in our conscience, we are finished with the exercise of the spirit
If we are about to argue with someone and we say to ourselves, 'I must try not to argue with people,' that will not work
When we meet a brother, we will not need to tell ourselves not to argue; we will know only to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord
When we come to hear a message, we may come to listen by exercising our spirit and receiving the nourishment from it
Only one thing avails: learn to love the Lord, deal with Him thoroughly, exercise your spirit, and contact Him
It is not a matter of knowledge, not a matter of learning the messages; it is a matter of the real growth in life
We will have a pure, transparent conscience, and we will be strong in exercising the spirit and contacting the Lord
In addition, all our problems with others will be spontaneously solved by this growth of life, and we will be built with others
If we put these things into practice, we will be led into boundless riches, a boundless realm of spiritual riches
There is no other way to realize this growth except by loving the Lord, dealing with and being dealt with by Him, and learning to exercise
We have to confess all our failures, weaknesses, and trespasses to make a thorough clearance of the past before the Lord
Regardless of how much we may consider ourselves to be mature, we will not actually be mature, because real maturity equals building
Strictly speaking, if we are not a building, we are not a church in practice; we are only a church in name with meetings
We cannot say that since we have many pieces of good, wonderful, beautiful materials, we have a building, a house
If it is not for the purpose of having the church life, there is no reason for us to have this kind of meeting
We further need to realize that if we are not built up we cannot have the church life we will have the church in term only not in practice
Since it deals with the Head though it has something to do with the Body because the Head is always related to the Body and is for the Body
Colossians 4:6 says, 'Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one'
Some may say that it is because Colossians reveals Christ as the Head, and a person's speech comes from his head
The more we talk, the more we prove we are foolish, because we expose ourselves more and sell ourselves cheaply
A third time, some came to him and said, 'Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are'
We may illustrate this with a diagram of a person with a head, heart, and spirit, each part being progressively deeper within him
After ten minutes, though, he gets down to his heart, but after half an hour, what he speaks is from his spirit
By our experience, we know that all our speech and conversation must be salted by the killing element of the cross
We may drop what we were going to speak because we realize that our motive was not pure; it needs to be purified
Are we speaking from the Lord as the source through our spirit, or are we speaking something out of ourselves, out of the flesh or the self?
In these messages we have been fellowshipping about loving the Lord, seeking the Lord, and practicing the church life
Are we in a proper position, appointed and ordained by God to speak a word, or are we speaking out of our own position?
The more one keeps the order here, the more he is profited, because this is a country of law, and a country of law is a country of order
We simply have to realize that in order to have a proper church life and be built up together each one of us must learn to keep his position
Even in our home and family life, we have to check our speaking by the above three things: the motive, the source, and the position
As a husband, you must speak things in the position of the husband, and as a wife, you must speak things in the position of the wife
At this time the germs are spreading by our careless talk, by our speech that is not according to the lesson we should learn
Our human life, our self, is the match, and this match is set on fire by the tongue as an evil fire from Gehenna
If we are truly willing to grow, the first thing the Lord must check is our talking, particularly our motive, the source, and our position
We should always check whether it is profitable for the building of the church that we speak something in a certain way
We all have to learn this lesson that we may grow, so that the real building up of the church might be realized
The unsearchable riches of Christ are in the dimensions of Christ in verse 18: the breadth, length, height, and depth
We do not know how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth
He preached the unsearchable riches of Christ so that the saints together may apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth
Timothy 2:22 says that we should flee certain things and pursue with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
Not many, but some, are being utilized by the enemy to distract us, particularly the young ones, by their secret talking
The leading brothers among the young people have to pray together very much that the Lord would deliver them from anything other than Christ
Ephesians 3:18 is Paul's prayer that we would apprehend with all the saints the dimensions and the riches of Christ
Now we have to help the saints to put this into practice, because the messages, teachings, doctrine, and knowledge are not adequate
The most profitable and proper way to meet is to fellowship with one another according to the instruction we have received
If we only tell a person how to turn the steering wheel, he still will not know how to drive; rather, he needs practice
To put this into practice, though, we can ask a brother, 'Would you please tell us what your experience is of dealing with your conscience'?
If by the Lord's grace we take this way, then week after week and month after month the saints will grow in life
To help the brothers and sisters to go on in a practical way, however, requires that we have the real experience
In the church the ones who are truly spiritual and actually know something always like to hide themselves, to make themselves hidden
Once a week on the Lord's Day morning, some brothers who truly know something of the Lord can give us a message of ministry
