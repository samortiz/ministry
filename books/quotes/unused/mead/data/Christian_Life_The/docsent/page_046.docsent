   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The flesh has lost its job.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is all related to the death of Christ dealing with the old man.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Jewish religion is built upon these three pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These became a strong factor of separation, separating the Jews from all the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, all of the different cultures have their ordinances.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now regardless of our race or culture, we all can be one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>With all of the ordinances, we could have never been the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How can the Chinese and the Japanese, and the whites and the blacks be one new man?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They can be one new man because Christ slew all the ordinances and crucified all the natural persons on the cross.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Through His all-inclusive death, Christ slew the enmity between Israel and the Gentiles that the two might be reconciled to God in one Body Eph 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He created the two into one new man and reconciled both in one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The one new man is the one Body.</S>
