<h2 class=head2>Being Experienced in the Principle of Laying on of Hands</h2><p>For this reason, the other cases of the outpouring of the Spirit, without exception, required only the laying on of hands. In Acts 8, Peter and John laid hands on the Samaritan believers (v. 17). In the following chapter even Saul of Tarsus did not receive the baptism directly from the Head; he received the experience of the baptism through the laying on of hands by a small disciple, Ananias (9:17). Later, Paul laid hands on the Ephesian believers (19:6).<p>This indicates that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is already accomplished on the Body, while the experience of the baptism was later obtained by the new members who were added to the Body. The new members needed some older members to represent the Body to bring the new ones into the Body. This identification of the new members with the Body is continuing all the time. Therefore, there is no need for another baptism in the Holy Spirit because the Body has received it already. What we need today is the experience of what the Body has received. The way to experience it is to realize the right relationship with the Body, which is the principle behind the laying on of hands.<p>The baptism was accomplished by the Head Himself directly on the Body. On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius the ascended Head directly baptized His Body in the Holy Spirit. However, with all the other cases involving new members being added to the Body, there was the need of an indirect contact through representative members of the Body who laid hands on them to identify them with the Body. The laying on of hands is not a mere form or practice. Rather, it represents the principle of the right relationship with the Body. When we are right with the Body, knit with the Body, and standing with the Body, and when we realize that we are living members of the Body, we receive everything that is of the Body.<p>In this sense, the laying on of hands can be compared to baptism in water, which also is not a mere form. We need the form of baptism in water, but the form does not accomplish anything in itself; its significance is its principle and reality. In the same way, the laying on of hands is a principle representing the reality of the right relationship with the Body. Ananias, for example, would not have laid hands on a child who was not yet saved. This is because that child had no relationship with the Body. The laying on of hands is based on and represents a relationship with the Body.<p>The most important matter is that we have a heavenly vision to see what the real significance is of the Lord’s resurrection and ascension. Resurrection means that the Triune God—God in Christ as the Spirit—has come into us as our life and nature. By His ascension the Triune God has come down upon us as authority. Therefore, we have the Triune God within as our life and without as our authority. Now, in order for us to experience this authority, this inauguration, we must realize the reality of the Body. We must realize that we are members of the Body, and we must have a proper relationship with the Body. If we are in the Body, with the Body, and for the Body, we are in the position to claim whatever is of the Body.<p>Thus, it is easy for us to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit. To experience the baptism is not a matter of speaking in tongues. The experience of the baptism is a matter of authority and power. Many believers have never spoken in tongues, but they do have the authority. This indicates that they have the very experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. They have the authority and the power, and they are qualified, equipped, and authorized to do something for the Head in the Body.
