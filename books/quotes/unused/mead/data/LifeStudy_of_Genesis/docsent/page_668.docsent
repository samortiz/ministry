   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN BEING MATURED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REIGNING ASPECT OF THE MATURED ISRAEL 6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we consider the story of Joseph, we need to remember that in his record there are two lines: the line of Joseph as a type of Christ and the line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is difficult to find in the Old Testament anyone besides Joseph who was such a perfect type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He typified Christ in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>m Christ Giving the Remnant of Israel the Last Test</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 44:1-13 Joseph gave his brothers the last test and gave them even more time to consider him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ will do the same thing to the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The prophecies in the Bible say that Christ will test the ignorant children of Israel, but they do not give the details.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the record of Joseph's dealing with his brothers gives us a detailed picture of this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even today the nation of Israel is ignorant of the fact that Christ is testing them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we follow the world news, we should hold a view different from that of the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I read the news, I am aware that what is happening in the Middle East is part of Christ's testing of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Israeli prime minister and his cabinet do not know that Christ is testing them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They claim to need the Golan Heights and the settlements along the Sinai to secure their existence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, Christ knows better than they do what they need for their security.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you not believe that what is happening to Israel today is a test?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I certainly do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is Joseph's testing of his brothers in order to teach them and discipline them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I expect this testing to continue year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus Christ knows how to deal with the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>n Still Remaining Ignorant of Him</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As Joseph gave his brothers a further test, they still remained ignorant of him 44:14-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same will be true of the nation of Israel as Christ continues to test them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What patience Joseph had!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not have nearly the patience that he had or the patience that the Lord Jesus has with Israel today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I had been Joseph, I would have revealed myself to the brothers much sooner than he did.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And if I were the Lord Jesus, I would immediately tell the whole world that the Israelites are my brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Joseph, however, dealt with his brothers patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were ignorant of him, and the Egyptians were ignorant of what was going on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only Joseph knew what he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The situation is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only the Lord Jesus, not the United Nations or the ruler of any country, knows what is taking place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although He is giving the nation of Israel a difficult time, there is a definite purpose in all He is doing.</S>
