If need be, I will move the teachers and students to Szechuan. I also have the burden to take the children with me to Yunnan to pioneer that place and to organize a new community. This is a big task, and I look to the Lord for His guidance and blessing. I ask that my work be published in The Open Door so that the brothers and sisters can pray for me.
