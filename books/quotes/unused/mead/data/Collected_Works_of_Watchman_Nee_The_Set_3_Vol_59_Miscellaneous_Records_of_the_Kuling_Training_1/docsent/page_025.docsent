   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Deliverance from Mammon Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>a Part of Our Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second, being delivered from mammon is a part of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to show the brothers and sisters, according to the New Testament, first that mammon is an idol, and second that we have been delivered from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Deliverance from mammon is part of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is like deliverance from sin, the world, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people know that in order to be saved, a man must be delivered from sin, from God's punishment, and from the world's bondage, but many people do not know that salvation includes deliverance from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Luke 18 and 19, three things eternal life, the kingdom of the heavens, and salvation are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All three things relate to mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, the young ruler wanted to inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord told him to sell all that he had and to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, the Lord spoke on the difficulty of a rich man's entry into God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter God's kingdom!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He went on to say that those who give up houses, wives, or children for the kingdom's sake would receive a hundredfold in this age and eternal life in the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An entry into God's kingdom requires the forsaking of one's all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peter was saved because he forsook his all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who are able to avoid the fate of a camel which has difficulty passing through a needle's eye are the ones who have forsaken their all to enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third, Zaccheus gave half of his possessions to the poor, and the Lord said that salvation had come to his house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in order for a man to receive eternal life, the kingdom, and salvation, he has to be delivered from mammon and to dispose of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we are not doing a fund-raising work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are here to help others to receive eternal life, to enter the kingdom, and to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we ask many people if they want the kingdom, they will say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we ask them if they want eternal life, they will also say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we ask them if they want to be saved, they will say yes all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If, however, we ask if they want to be delivered from mammon, they will say no. A brother from a denomination came to our meetings, and said to my brother Hwai-zhu, "You are very good at fund-raising here at Hardoon Road." My brother asked why he was so interested in the saints' consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He answered, "I want to learn and observe a few more times.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If your method works well, we will do the same in our denomination."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This man only saw how money was offered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He did not see how we teach men to be delivered from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Peter heard the Lord's word concerning a camel going through a needle's eye being easier than a rich man entering God's kingdom, he asked, "Then who can be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He forgot that he himself was a camel, and that this camel, in fact, had passed through the needle's eye already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He forgot that there were eleven other camels who had done the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While there is nothing harder than a rich man being saved, what is impossible with man is possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The rich young ruler turned back.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was not a sinner or an evil man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was charming and godly, yet he was not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Zaccheus was also a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was a slave of mammon, yet he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He climbed up and down the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His going up and coming down undid him; it made him poor; nevertheless, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The young ruler is an example of what is "impossible with men," and Zaccheus is an example of what is "possible with God."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man experiences joy when his sins are forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He experiences the same joy when he is delivered from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When a man believes in the Lord, he finds peace in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When mammon no longer occupies any place in him, he also finds peace in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The receiving of eternal life is something that God accomplishes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Deliverance from mammon is also something that God accomplishes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Forgiveness of sins, the receiving of eternal life, and deliverance from mammon are all God's accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peter asked, "Then who can be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord could have answered him, saying, "Zaccheus!"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God works in us, we will no longer remain a camel; we will be saved from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our salvation includes salvation from mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should never leave out this item in our consideration of the sphere our salvation.</S>
