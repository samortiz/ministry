ONE NEEDING TO KNOW GOD AND GOD&rsquo;S WAYS<br />
AND TO HAVE A PROPER BEING</h2>
<p>If we want to be prophets, we must have a foundation in God&rsquo;s word; without a foundation in God&rsquo;s word, it will be difficult for us to speak for God. Moreover, our person must be right; if our person is not right, it will be futile even if we can prophesy well. The prophets need the revelations in God&rsquo;s word, and the teachers who present a teaching also need the riches of God. When I was newly saved, I was desirous of the truth and tried my best to find books to read. At that time, I was a poor student and did not have much money. In addition, I did not live in a big city, so not many books were available; nevertheless, I still did my best to buy books.</p>
<p>When I first began to read, I did not have much discernment, and I thought that all the books were good. I read one book that expounded the matter of the leaven in Matthew 13:33. This verse says that leaven was hidden in three measures of meal. The book explained that leaven is the power of the gospel that motivates the democratic nation and society. When I first read this, I felt that it was a good exposition. Gradually, however, as I joined the meetings of the Brethren assembly, heard their expositions, and read their books, I began to realize that the mention of leaven throughout the entire Bible, whether in the Old Testament or in the New Testament, is always related to something evil. First, it signifies evil; second, it signifies corrupted things, because of the germs within the leaven. This exposition has its scriptural basis in the Old Testament. After keeping the Feast of the Passover, the children of Israel kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread in which they ate unleavened bread (Exo. 23:14-15). In the New Testament the Lord Jesus also spoke regarding leaven, saying, &ldquo;Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees&rdquo; (Matt. 16:6). After learning the correct interpretation of leaven, I abhorred the harmful books that I had read. For them to cheat me of my money is a matter of little consequence, but it is a serious thing for them to deceive my mind and rob my energy.</p>
<p>It is not easy to be a good teacher and to expound the teachings in the Bible. Moreover, not everyone can expound the Bible, because the Bible is not an ordinary book to be read and understood by anyone according to his own taste. The Bible has its principles. Thus, in order to speak for God, we need to see the revelations contained in the Bible; then when we teach people, we must take God&rsquo;s riches as the content and reality in our teaching. Only in this way can people touch God and receive God&rsquo;s riches in our words. Furthermore, we need to instruct people concerning the ordinances, principles, and statutes in God&rsquo;s Word; this will constitute a good prophecy.</p>
<p>Psalm 103:7 says, &ldquo;He made His ways known to Moses; / His acts, to the children of Israel.&rdquo; This indicates that for a teacher to apply God&rsquo;s word, he needs to know God and God&rsquo;s ways. Only then can his speaking minister God to others, open their eyes, and cause them to know the ways of God. God&rsquo;s ways are the laws, the principles, by which God acts. For example, we know that God is righteous and that He never does things that are unrighteous; this is a law, a principle. If we want to help people to see this principle of God, we should never do anything that wrongs another person. Only when we ourselves have come to know the ways of God will we be able to teach them to others. Hence, a person who teaches and preaches must enjoy God and know both God and God&rsquo;s ways. Obtaining a basic constitution of the truth does not come simply by linking together a few verses in the Bible prior to coming to the meeting; it does not come so easily.</p>
<p>Prophesying and teaching require us to be persons who know God, enjoy God, and know God&rsquo;s ways, God&rsquo;s rules, and God&rsquo;s principles. We must familiarize ourselves with the stories in the Old Testament so that in these stories we may see God and God&rsquo;s ways and thus be able to derive messages from them. Then when we speak, we will enable others to realize that God is full of lovingkindness, full of forgiveness, and abounding in grace. In this way, we speak forth God and speak God into others for their enjoyment.</p>
<p>Genuine teachings come from our labor in God&rsquo;s word; nevertheless, this differs from studying hard in school as a student. It does not matter whether the being of a student studying in school is right or not; his results will be fine as long as he studies hard. The school cannot determine that because a student is a thief, he will not do well academically, nor can it expect that because another student is a modest gentleman, he will obtain a perfect score on his exam. The score one obtains on an examination depends upon how much effort one puts in. Even if a student is a thief, as long as he spends time to study hard before an examination, he will be able to earn a good score. In contrast, if a person both steals and spends time studying God&rsquo;s word, he absolutely will not obtain a perfect score, because his person is not right. His person disqualifies him from speaking concerning God&rsquo;s ways, because God&rsquo;s ways are righteous and therefore will not permit any stealing. Hence, when we speak for God, our person must be right.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
