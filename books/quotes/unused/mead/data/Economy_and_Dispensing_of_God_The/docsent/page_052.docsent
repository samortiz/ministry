   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the Fullness of God to Be the Corporate Expression of God in the Universe</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the church there is also the need for Christ to make His home in the believers' hearts Eph 3:14-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is now in us, but He is not yet settled in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There may be some "rooms" within us for Christ, but He may still not be able to make His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In my traveling I am often received into peoples' homes; but I can never settle in these homes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My desire always is to go back to my own home.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While I am staying in others' homes, I do not have the liberty to touch many things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when I am in my own home, I am free to touch everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ earnestly desires to make His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul prayed purposely for this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He bowed his knees to the Father, who is the source of all the families in this universe, and offered a very proper and complete prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He prayed that the Father would strengthen us with power through the Spirit according to the riches of His glory, that Christ may make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is in our spirit already, but He must spread from our spirit into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our spirit is in the center of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is where Christ is today 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This spirit is surrounded by our heart, which is composed of our mind, emotion, and will, plus our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times Christ tries to spread from our spirit to our mind, but we will not allow Him to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, He is confined to our spirit; our spirit becomes His guest house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not yet able to make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes the Lord may try to stretch out and take a part of our emotion, but we will not give Him permission.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, He cannot get through in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the meeting or during the morning watch, we may be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But immediately after the meeting or the morning watch, Christ is forced to shrink back.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We allow Him to stay in our mind only for awhile.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, He is forced back to His guest house, which is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we are weak, Paul prayed that we would be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to be strengthened into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that all our inward parts, including our mind, emotion, will, and conscience, must be gathered together into our spirit and come under the control of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way, Christ will have the freedom to spread into all the parts of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will fill and take over every part and will settle in our inner man, making our inner man His home.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result of this is that we will be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We will then have the capacity to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ, which are His breadth, His length, His height, and His depth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will also be able to know the knowledge- surpassing love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that we will be saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The riches of Christ will be dispensed into every part of our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The result of this total dispensing of Christ is His settling in our entire being, making our entire being His home.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This kind of divine dispensing will make the church the actual, real, and full habitation of the Triune God.</S>
