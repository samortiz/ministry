   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Eloquence versus Utterance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope you would also give me the freedom and the mercy to say something frankly and honestly to you all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since I have been in America over twenty-two years, I have noticed that most of the Chinese are far inferior in speaking in comparison to the Americans because of the different educational principles in their cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most American children learn how to speak and the mothers check on their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Chinese are the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even in their schools they do not train people to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Americans may know only five percent, yet they can speak ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Chinese may know ten percent, but they cannot speak five percent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I was listening to the testimonies in the meetings concerning the Life-study of the Bible, I noticed that the American saints are very smart in picking up funny thoughts many times, but they neglect the crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They say things to make everyone laugh, but there are not crucial points to impress people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One brother said that every time he listens to my speaking, he always feels that I do not have the eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, this brother testified that after I was finished speaking, something of life and the Spirit had gotten into him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Ephesians 6:19 the Apostle Paul charged the saints to pray for him that he might have the utterance, and in Colossians 4:3 the apostle charged the saints there to pray that God would open a door of utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This word in the Greek for utterance is logos, the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Speaking in the spiritual realm is not a matter of eloquence but a matter of utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is possible that a person may be able to speak quite well and eloquently and still impart nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Another person may utter things in an awkward way, but in his awkward speaking the Spirit is ministered 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the biblical utterance, the logos.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a word which is not for good listening, but a word that conveys a diamond to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Public speakers are trained not to repeat too much, but in the ministry we are not concerned for the rules of public speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the ministry we are serving people with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you speak, you must believe that the Spirit is speaking with you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must follow the Spirit s feeling as to whether what you have spoken has been really taken and received by the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes you may have repeated something twice already, yet in your spirit you have the realization that you did not get through on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, you do not save your sermon and you do not care for your good speech.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must care for the presenting of the diamond to people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes the mother in a family must repeat herself many times to get the food into her naughty child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many times I must repeat myself because of your naughtiness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I realize that the naughty boys did not get it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not care for good manners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I only care for my children getting the food into them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times in our past we sat under a very trained, educated, and eloquent pastor but after his speaking we went home with nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the last ten years, however, many of you have been sitting under a kind of speaking which is awkward and repetitious, but when you go home you have the realization that an injection got into you which heals and nourishes you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our reading of the Bible we must also take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must repeat our reading to take care of a certain point repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In like manner, when you get into the printed pages of the Life-study, you should not pick up funny thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must pick up the crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Realizing the Crucial Points</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I told the saints a number of times that in their corporate pray-reading of the Word they should not make fun or pray with funny thoughts to make others laugh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means nothing and despises the meeting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are pray-reading in the presence of the Lord, and even with the Lord inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How could we pray in a playing way?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the same principle, in reading the pages of the Life-study messages, we must learn how to realize the crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, when there is a message telling us that Jesus Christ was designated the Son of God we must consider what it means for Him to be designated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must pick up this crucial point because today we are the same in principle as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was there as a man in the flesh with the name Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We also are men in the flesh, but within us we have the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the flesh Jesus is out of the seed of David, but according to the Spirit of holiness Jesus was designated the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We also need to be designated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not think that only Jesus needed the designation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today all His believers in Him need the same kind of designation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In my messages on Romans I mentioned clearly that this kind of designation of the Lord Jesus should also be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Designation is actually our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Sanctification is to live out the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, designation is to let the Lord live out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When He lives out of us, this living out is His designation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now we can see that this is not just a doctrinal, objective point of theology that has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to the flesh our Lord is out of the seed of David, but according to the Spirit of holiness He is designated the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Theology would merely tell us that this shows that Christ has two natures one according to the flesh and the other according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to the flesh, He is the Son of David and according to the Spirit, He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is very much like today s theology.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The seminary graduates are trained and taught in this way yet they never applied these things to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Apostle Paul, however, was not that way and we should not be that way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Paul s very opening words in the book of Romans he laid a foundation of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even Jesus needed the sanctification, the designation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we must learn that when we read a proper exposition or commentary of the holy Word, we should not read it as a newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must pick up the crucial points.</S>
