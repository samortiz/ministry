	 <h2 class="head1">CHRIST, THE CHURCH, GOD, AND REVELATION<br />
BEING VERSUS RELIGION, TRADITION, MAN, AND<br />
THE TEACHING OF MAN</h2>
<p>In Galatians 1 there are four negative items and four positive ones. On the negative side there are religion (represented by Judaism&mdash;vv. 13-14), tradition (v. 14), man (vv. 1, 11-12), and the teaching of man (v. 12). Then on the positive side we have Christ, who is versus religion (vv. 1, 12, 16); the church, which is versus tradition (v. 13); God, who is versus man (vv. 10, 15); and revelation, which is versus the teaching of man (vv. 12, 16). Paul was &ldquo;an apostle (not from men nor through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead)&rdquo; (v. 1). Paul&rsquo;s source and origin as an apostle was not man but God. Moreover, the gospel he announced to the Galatians was not according to man, received from man, nor taught by man (vv. 11-12). Rather, his gospel was received through a revelation of Jesus Christ. Teaching produces a religion, in which there are many traditions, but a revelation conveys and imparts Christ, issuing in the church, which is God&rsquo;s will. God, Christ, the church, and revelation are versus man, religion, tradition, and the teaching of man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELIGION BEING THE PRESENT EVIL AGE</h2>
<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s emphasis here is not that we are rescued from hell but that we are rescued out of the present age. The world as a whole is Satan&rsquo;s system, which is divided into many different ages. The nineteenth century was one age, and the twentieth century is another. Before World War I was one age, and after World War II was another. The 1960s brought yet another age with a certain kind of behavior, dress, and appearance. All these ages put together compose the world. Paul says that Christ gave Himself for our sins to rescue us out of the present evil age. According to the context of Galatians, the present age at Paul&rsquo;s time was religion. To be rescued from religion at that time was to be delivered from the present evil age.</p>
<p>At the time of the apostle Paul, Judaism had become the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; religion in the regions of the Mediterranean Sea, including Asia Minor, where Galatia was. To be one who was circumcised, who kept the Sabbath, and who kept the ordinances concerning eating according to Leviticus was to be an up-to-date religious person. In the same principle today, Christianity is the modern, popular religion of much of the world. To be modern is simply to be according to the present age. Thus, to be delivered out of the present evil age is to be delivered out of something modern. Christ gave Himself for our sins that He might deliver us out of the religion of the modern age, which in Paul&rsquo;s time was the religion of Judaism and in our own time is the religion of Christianity.</p>
<p>A dictionary may tell us that <em>religion</em> is a good word, but Galatians 1 indicates that religion is versus Christ. It is something that persecutes the church, ravages it, and tries to root it out. Some may say that Judaism is the wrong religion, and now we have the right religion. However, this is not accurate. Religion is anything done for Christ but not having the presence and reality of Christ. Judaism was a religion founded according to the holy Word, just as today the fundamental things of Christianity are also based on the Word of God. Nevertheless, many in Christianity honor only its outward traditions and holidays without being truly for Christ in a pure way. By this we can see that religion is versus Christ. Today we still need to be delivered from the present evil age of religion.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes, the old and traditional practices in Christianity without the presence and reality of Christ are a part of the present evil age. The religious age is evil because it keeps people from Christ and the church as God&rsquo;s will. There is nothing as evil in God&rsquo;s eyes as that which keeps us from Christ. In this principle, traditional and religious Christianity today is the present evil age, just as Judaism was in the days of the apostles. At that time, it was not mainly the world or the sinners that opposed the apostles. It was Judaism as the present evil age. The Jewish religion even condemned the Lord Jesus to death according to their understanding of the Scriptures. Paul says, &ldquo;You have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it&rdquo; (v. 13). Is this not evil? What can be more evil than this? Man discerns religion according to the view of tradition and morality, but God discerns it from the view of His eternal purpose. Nothing damages God&rsquo;s eternal purpose as much as religion. Millions of people have been distracted by Catholicism and the Christian denominations. On the one hand, they bring people to God initially, but on the other hand, they distract people from God&rsquo;s eternal purpose to have the church as the built-up Body of Christ in oneness. Even today, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is confronting opposition from traditional Christianity as the present evil age.</p>
