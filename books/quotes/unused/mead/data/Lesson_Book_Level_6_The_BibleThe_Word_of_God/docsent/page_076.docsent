   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PROVERBS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A. The writer s , the place, and the time: Like Psalms, Proverbs is a compilation; it was not written by one person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Just as David is the most important contributing author of the Psalms, Solomon is the most significant author of Proverbs 1:1; 10:1; 25:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Solomon wrote three thousand proverbs 1 Kings 4:32; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>12:9 , and this book contains the best selections from among those proverbs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition to the ones he wrote himself, he also collected a number of traditional and popular sayings and converted them into proverbs; in this book they are referred to as the words of the wise 22:17; 24:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapter 30 consists of the proverbs of Agur; chapter 31 is the sayings of Lemuel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The origin of this book is as follows: first, from among Solomon s three thousand proverbs, some were selected which were more important and regularly quoted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then, during the time of Hezekiah, this king added some of the proverbs of his ancestors to the collection chs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>25 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, the proverbs of Agur and Lemuel were added, thus completing the book of Proverbs that we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regardless of the writers identity or the process by which it was compiled, the proverbs in this book are not ordinary exhortations urging men to be virtuous, or teaching ethics and good behavior, but they are golden verses inspired by the one Holy Spirit to cause men to revere and respect God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The subject: living a godly life by God s wisdom Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>C. The background: Proverbs have existed from the most ancient times, and they were especially popular in the East.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>People used them to instruct young children, because in those days books were very scarce and expensive, not easy to come by, but proverbs were compact and simple, easy to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Often one brief and weighty, powerful proverb became a person s motto, affecting his manner of living for his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D. The central thought: Seek after wisdom so that you may live a godly life on earth that is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>E. The general sketch: The beginning of this book clearly states: The proverbs of Solomon...to know wisdom and instruction 1:1, 2 . So the purpose of this book is to seek wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Counsel, prudence, discretion, instruction, understanding, and knowledge, spoken of in this book, are all wisdom, whereas simple, fools, folly, void of understanding, foolishness, ignominy, and without knowledge all refer to the opposite of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Wisdom here does not refer to the wisdom of the world 1 Cor 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Human philosophy, science, common sense, comprehension, discernment, and aptitude are not what is meant by wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, the wisdom spoken of here indicates man s knowledge and fear toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding 9:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is omniscient.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The true wisdom is to know Him and understand His ways; it is to fear Him and carry out His will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you have such wisdom, then you can show forth holiness, righteousness, goodness, noble characteristics, and all-surpassing virtues in your living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But how can one attain to such true wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Old Testament believers had to deeply know and strictly fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We, the New Testament believers, are more blessed than they, because we simply need to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The wisdom which was in ancient times, which from the beginning was in the presence of God, through which He created the universe 8:22-31 has become flesh and dwelt among us, and this is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whoever has the Lord Jesus has that wisdom, because He is God s wisdom 1 Cor 1:24 , and He has become wisdom to us from God 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this book is in the Old Testament, it is also valuable to New Testament believers, because it is full of advice on how to deal with people, standards of behavior, governing principles for a believer s walk, how to be free from evil snares, and how to receive God s approval.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With regards to the believers who seek and wait on God, 3:5-6 and 8:17 are words of comfort and guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Towards suffering, disciplined believers, 3:12 is a word full of help and guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>F. The sections: Proverbs is primarily composed of stand-alone golden verses, not necessarily related to the ones before and after.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, it is more difficult to divide into sections than any other book.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can divide it into five sections according to content: 1 foreword 1:1-6 , 2 the importance of seeking wisdom and the danger of lacking it 1:7 9 , 3 comparison between wise and foolish, virtuous and evil chs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>10 24 , 4 proverbs compiled during the time of Hezekiah chs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>25 29 , and 5 common proverbs: a the words of Agur ch.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>30 and b the words of Lemuel ch.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>31 .</S>
