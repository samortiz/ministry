Interpreting the Bible</H2><P>In reading the Bible, sometimes there is also the danger of developing the latent power of the soul. For example, a person may not understand a certain portion of the Scripture; he may continue to think about it while he is walking, lying on his bed, in his study, or on the tram. Suddenly, he may feel a light shining on him like a flashlight, and he may feel that he understands this section of Scripture in a very reasonable way. All the reasons and explanations are laid in front of him. If he has a good memory, he may memorize them, and if he does not have a good memory, he may write them down in his notebook. He may think that he has received much. But is this reliable? It is possible that the soulish power was involved. To find out, look at the fruit. Novel, special, and meaningful thoughts may seem to be very deep, but they do not bear fruit. Not only can he not gain any life from them, but when he shares them with others, others cannot gain any life from them either. All they do is render something to others' thoughts. I am not saying that God cannot convey His thought to us while we are thinking, nor am I saying that God cannot give us His word suddenly on the road or in a room. God can give us something suddenly. But please remember that God never gives His word to a person when he has no need for it. Every time a thought or knowledge comes from God, it is for the purpose of meeting our need. When God gives us money, He will not give us a dollar just for us to hide it in a hole to use five years later. The same is also true when He gives us the truth. When we have no need, God will not give us any truth. Furthermore, He will not listen to any prayer or petition that does not speak of a need. Someone has said very well that the first condition for God to work is need. Need is the first step to miracles. This is the principle of getting an answer from prayer. God will never work against this principle, but Satan will always work against this principle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Rejoicing</H2><P>Many people want to have the feeling of joy. There is one thing which is very popular in Western countries now. It is called the "holy laugh." Some say that once a person is filled with the Holy Spirit, he will have this kind of so-called holy laugh. Those who laugh this way do not know why they laugh; they seem to have caught some kind of disease which keeps them laughing uncontrollably, as if they have gone insane. One time after a meeting, it was proposed that everyone seek this kind of holy laugh. Soon after, all the people began kicking tables and chairs and dancing wildly like mad people. After a while, the so-called holy laugh started. Everyone began to laugh at each other. The more it went on, the harder they laughed. Eventually, everyone laughed so hard that they could not stop. What is this? Is this the infilling of the Holy Spirit? Is this the work of the Holy Spirit? This is only one of the many works of the soul!</P><P>I mention this extreme case as an example. If we know how far off an extreme case is, we more likely will know what is two or three degrees off. The most help I received from Mr. Barlow, while he was here meeting with us, was his statement that if you want to see whether or not something is wrong, all you have to do is exaggerate it one hundred degrees and push it to the extreme. If it is wrong at one hundred degrees, you can be sure that it is wrong at one or two degrees. It is difficult to find out whether or not it is wrong at one or two degrees because though it may be off, it is off by only a little; it is not easy to discern the difference. However, if you enlarge and stretch it a little, you will be clearer. A Chinese proverb says, "Off by an inch, and one will miss by a thousand miles." In the beginning you may be off by only an inch. But in the end you will miss the mark by a thousand miles. Putting it another way, if you want to know if you are off by an inch, all you have to do is consider if the outcome will miss by a thousand miles. This in fact is even easier. If two lines are out of parallel alignment by only one or two degrees, our eyes may not be able to detect it. But if we extend the two lines for an inch, the distance between them will become greater, and if we extend them two inches more, the distance between them will become still greater. If we extend the two lines to the other end of the earth, the distance will be many thousands of miles. Therefore, if we can see that the difference of many thousands of miles is wrong, the little difference at the beginning must also be wrong.</P><P>Today we are only using the holy laugh as an example. By what method, or by meeting what kind of conditions, do these people obtain this kind of holy laugh? They obtain it because they have a desire to laugh in their heart, and they have the thought to laugh in their mind. It is true that they are seeking the filling of the Holy Spirit, and it is true that they are saying with their mouth, "Lord, fill me with Your Spirit." However, these words are only a procedure that they go through; this is not really their goal. Although they say this with their mouth, where is their heart? What is their goal? They want to laugh and be happy. They are not saying, "God, fill me with Your Spirit. I do not care about any outside feeling. As long as You will fill me up, I will not care for anything else." Whoever wants to be filled with God's Spirit must have this attitude. However, if all we pray for is the holy laugh, we will surely end up with nothing other than laughter. But can we say that this is from God?</P><P>Let me tell you a true story. There was a student who had repented and believed in the Lord. He had a classmate who had received the so-called filling of the Holy Spirit and was very happy. The classmate was so happy he could not contain his happiness. The classmate told his friend, "You should ask for the infilling of the Holy Spirit. I have already received it; this is why I am happy all day long. I have no worries at all. Being happy all day long can help your spiritual growth." This person thought that since his classmate was a believer and had received the infilling, he should have it too. From that time on he began to pray to God desperately, to a point that he could not eat or study. He prayed incessantly for God to give it to him. Later he went to a teacher and asked the teacher to pray for him, while he himself also prayed desperately, saying, "God, tonight You have to give me the infilling. If You do not give it to me, I will not get up from my knees." He prayed repeatedly this way. Not too long after he began praying, he jumped up and said, "I am really happy now." He began to laugh and laugh. He began to wave his hand and dance around the place. He laughed so hard that he was even shouting. The teacher later related the incident: "At that time I forgot I was a Christian; I only knew that I was a doctor, and I thought that he was out of his mind. I dragged him down and said, `Brother, be quiet. Brother, be quiet. Do not be so silly.' The more I persuaded him this way, the worse he became." The teacher dared not say much more, because he felt that if this was indeed something from God, he would be offending the Holy Spirit. The student then went back home. Fortunately nothing more happened to him the next day. This was nothing other than a strong release of soul-power. If you were to ask me what this was and what caused this to happen, I would say I do not know. Perhaps even the best psychologist would not know. I dare say that no one knows how to receive this power and be connected to it. But I can say that this was a work of the soul, because this person met the conditions for the release of soulish power. These are facts that can be proven. The soul has the power to do the most extraordinary things.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 10: The Present Testimony (3) &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
