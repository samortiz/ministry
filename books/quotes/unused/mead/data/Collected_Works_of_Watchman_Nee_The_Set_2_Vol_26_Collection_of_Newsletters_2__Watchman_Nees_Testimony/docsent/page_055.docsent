   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Wu:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It has been three months since we parted, and I really miss you.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I wrote a letter to Brother Mu before with this idea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God also clearly tells us in the Bible, "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is."</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is desolated to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This condition is also true in Nan Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have gone to listen to the messages in the denominations a few times, but they all speak..things that are fashionable to men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They do not even have the remembrance of the Lord.</S>
