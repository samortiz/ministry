SANCTIFICATION</H2><P>Sanctification is the process by which something is made holy. Many people would say that this means that we should not sin and that we should stay away from evil things. That, however, is only a small part of sanctification.</P><P>[God's eternal purpose is to work Himself into us that He may be thoroughly mingled with us and expressed through us. When God is born into us, He begins this mingling process. But this is only the start! There must be the growth. If we have the birth, but not the growth, we could never enjoy the birthright. God is born into our spirit, which is the very center of our being. Then His desire is to spread from our spirit to transform all the parts of the soul, and eventually to transfigure our physical body. By this process our whole being will be saturated and permeated with the essence of God Himself. This is the real holiness and the real sanctification: to be completely mingled with God.]</P><P>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says, "God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth." [The Spirit is sanctifying the believers, separating them entirely for God's eternal purpose; from the day we first heard the gospel the sanctifying Spirit sanctifies us by dispensing the Triune God into us.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE TWO ASPECTS OF SANCTIFICATION</H2><P>[The sanctification of the Spirit is of two aspects: the sanctification of the Spirit before justification, the first aspect, and the sanctification of the Spirit after justification, the second aspect. With the second aspect of the Spirit's sanctification there are two sides&#151; the positional side and the dispositional side. After God justifies us and regenerates us, immediately the sanctifying Spirit continues His separating work upon us and within us. First, the sanctifying Spirit separates us positionally from things that are common and worldly. This positional sanctification is objective. Simultaneously, the sanctifying Spirit also begins to sanctify us dispositionally. This means that the Spirit is sanctifying our disposition. This is the subjective side of the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. The subjective sanctification is what we mean by the work of transformation. Subjective sanctification involves the transformation of our disposition and our inward parts. Therefore, this transformation of our disposition is the dispositional sanctification of the Spirit.]</P>
