   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul s Word concerning Christ as a Slave</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Philippians 2:5-11 we have the word of the Apostle Paul concerning Christ as the Slave of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Subsisting in the Form of God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Philippians 2:5 and 6 Paul says, Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who subsisting in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that the Lord not only existed with God, but subsisted in the form of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered subsisting denotes existing from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This implies the Lord s eternal preexistence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To say that Christ existed in the form of God means that He subsisted in the expression of God s being Heb 1:3 , that He was identified with the essence and nature of God s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This refers to Christ s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Philippians 2:6, although Christ subsisted in the form of God, He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He was equal with God, but He did not consider this equality a treasure to be grasped and retained.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, He was willing to come to earth as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Emptying Himself, Taking the Form of a Slave</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Philippians 2:7 Paul goes on to say, But emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord emptied Himself of His position and glory and of other matters related to His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, He did not empty Himself of His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Having emptied Himself, the Lord came as a man, taking the form of a slave and becoming in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Philippians 2:7 we have two important words: form and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His incarnation the Lord did not alter His divine nature, but altered only His outward expression of the form of God to that of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was not a change of essence but of state.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ s deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He appeared outwardly to men as a man, but inwardly He had the reality of deity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He took the form of a slave and became a man in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Luke 2 we can see the Lord as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He came to Jerusalem with His parents, He was a human being, a child.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There we do not see the Lord as a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is when the Lord Jesus came out to minister that we see Him as a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the Lord ministered, He was a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, when He washed the feet of His disciples, He was in the form of a Slave John 13:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, the Lord became a man in man s likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then He behaved as a Slave in the form of a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a brother stands up to speak in a church meeting, he will certainly have the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if the same brother would put on work clothes and begin to vacuum the carpet, we may say that he has the form of a janitor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, he is a man, and then he has the form of a janitor.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This simple illustration may help us understand how the Lord became a man and then eventually ministered in the form of a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the disciples were arguing about who would be the greatest among them, the Lord told them that He came forth to serve as a Slave: The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many Mark 10:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here the Lord seems to be saying, Look at Me. I have come to serve as a Slave, even at the cost of My life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am ready to give My life as a ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By this we see that in His ministry the Lord served in the form of a Slave.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Humbling Himself, Becoming Obedient unto Death</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Philippians 2:8 Paul says, And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord s humbling Himself was a further step in His emptying Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ s self-humbling manifests His self-emptying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord became obedient even unto death, the death of a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord s death on the cross was the climax of His humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To the Jews the death of a cross was a curse Deut 21:22-23 , and to the Gentiles it was a death sentence imposed upon malefactors and slaves Matt 27:16-17, 20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, it was a shameful thing Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Highly Exalted and Given the Name</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Which Is above Every Name</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Philippians 2:9 Paul says, Wherefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord humbled Himself to the uttermost, but God exalted Him to the highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From the time of the Lord s ascension, there has not been a name on earth higher than the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul s word in Philippians 2:9 concerning the Lord s exaltation is similar to that prophesied in Isaiah 52:13.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With No Record of His Genealogy or His Status</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Gospel of Mark there is no record of the Lord s genealogy or His status.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because Mark presents the Savior as a Slave, he does not tell His genealogy or status, since the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With a Record Mainly of His Excellent Deeds</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The record concerning Christ as the Slave of God in the Gospel of Mark is not mainly a record of His wonderful words.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, it is a record of the Lord s excellent deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These deeds displayed both His lovely humanity in its virtue and perfection and His deity in its glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to be impressed with the fact that in the Gospel of Mark we see a Slave with a lovely humanity in its virtue and perfection and with deity in its glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>THE SLAVE-SAVIOR OF SINNERS</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Gospel of Mark presents the Lord Jesus as a Slave of God and as the Slave-Savior of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As the Slave-Savior, the Lord served sinners and gave His life as a ransom for them 10:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By giving His life as a ransom for sinners, the Lord as the Slave-Savior accomplished the eternal purpose of God, whom He served as a Slave.</S>
