   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 He who believes into Christ is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a union.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you believe into Him Christ , your sin becomes His, and He becomes one with you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2 Having believed into Christ, we should be baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Baptism is to be immersed into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 6:3 says, "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The way we are immersed into the water when we are baptized is the way we are immersed into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a copper coin is put into a bottle of sulfuric acid, the copper coin will melt, and we will not see the copper coin anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are immersed into Christ, we are melted into Christ and become one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3 "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus" 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has immersed us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Inwardly, we believe into Him; outwardly by baptism, we are immersed into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God joins us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has done this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we have righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is wonderful; we have it all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have no righteousness in ourselves; Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have no sanctification in ourselves; Christ is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have no redemption in ourselves; Christ is our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our eyes must be fixed on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May God remove our veils, so that we would see how complete God's accomplishment is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mr. Hudson Taylor once tried hard to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "I am always asking, but God never gives it to me; one day when I read John 15:5, I am the vine; you are the branches,' I immediately received the light."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Later he knelt down and prayed, saying, "I am the most foolish person in the whole world; the overcoming life that I am looking for, I already have."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are a branch; it is not that you want to be a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You are a branch; the life is yours already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For many years Mr. Taylor asked to be joined to the tree like a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Little did he realize that he was already a branch and already joined to the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not until the day he received the revelation from God and had genuine faith that he had the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later he was able to accomplish great things for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once he was asked to speak at the Keswick Convention, and he related this story.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He said, "After I failed, I sought for the overcoming life, only to find that I could never obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the day I believed, I received it."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, we are not hoping to draw out some sap from the root to nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are branches of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not have to care for anything as long as we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not need to take something from the tree to cultivate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All we have to do is believe that we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has joined us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everything that Christ has now belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we believe, we will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, we are baptized into Christ; on the other hand, by means of the bread and the cup, we contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the way for His life to freely flow.</S>
