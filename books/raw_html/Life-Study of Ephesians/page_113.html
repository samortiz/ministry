<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY</h2><p>In 3:3 Paul says that by revelation the mystery was made known to him. Do you think that the mystery has been made known only to the Apostle Paul and not been made known to all the other New Testament believers? We all have received the revelation of the mystery, the very revelation given to Paul. The reason Paul wrote the book of Ephesians was so that all the saints might know the mystery of Christ. In the years the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been in this country, the saints have seen more and more of the mystery of Christ. By receiving this revelation, we are constituted apostles and prophets, and we are qualified to speak concerning Christ and the church.</p><p>As prophets, we need to speak to those around us, regardless of whether we think that they understand what we are saying. Our responsibility is to speak wherever we are&mdash;at home or at our places of employment. Those who are parents need to speak to their children concerning God&rsquo;s economy. We also should contact our parents and relatives and tell them what we have seen regarding God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Do not be concerned about what others may think of you. Speak so that the unbelievers may be brought to the Lord. If we do not speak, how can others be saved? If we speak, at least some of those who hear us will come to the Lord. What an impact there will be if all the saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery open their mouths and speak concerning Christ and the church! Many of us have been cheated by the enemy into thinking that we are not qualified to speak for the Lord. Do not expect brothers with certain outstanding gifts to do all the speaking. This concept is wrong. As those who have received grace and who have seen the revelation of the mystery of Christ, we are today&rsquo;s apostles and prophets, and we can speak for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL SERVING ONES</h2><p>In 3:7 Paul said, &ldquo;Of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God, which was given to me according to the operation of His power.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;minister&rdquo; in this verse is the same word that is elsewhere in the New Testament rendered &ldquo;deacon.&rdquo; In fact &ldquo;deacon&rdquo; is the anglicized form of the Greek word used here. A minister or deacon is a serving one, not a high official. In this verse Paul was saying that he became a servant. According to the natural concept, the ministers are above the elders, and the elders are above the deacons. But if we have the proper understanding of this verse, we shall see that the ministers actually are deacons, those who serve. The word &ldquo;minister&rdquo; is a good word, but its meaning has been spoiled by traditional usage. According to the New Testament, to say that one is a minister is to say that he is simply a serving one. All believers in Christ are serving ones.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OPERATION OF GOD&rsquo;S POWER</h2><p>In 3:7 Paul speaks of the operation of God&rsquo;s power. This is the power of the resurrection life (Phil. 3:10), which operates within the apostle and all the believers (Eph. 1:19; 3:20). By such an inward operating power of life, the gift of grace was given to the apostle; that is, it was manifested in him.</p><p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;operation&rdquo; in verse 7 is the word from which the English word &ldquo;energy&rdquo; is derived. Within us and among us there is a divine energizing. This operation, this energizing, was not exclusively for the Apostle Paul; it is for all the saints. This is proved by 4:16, which, using the same Greek word, speaks of the &ldquo;operation in measure of each one part.&rdquo; The very same energizing that was in Paul is in every part of the Body. Such an energy is working within us today.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISPENSATION OF THE MYSTERY</h2><p>In 3:9 Paul speaks of bringing to light what is the dispensation of the mystery. The word &ldquo;dispensation&rdquo; here refers to the process of dispensing Christ as life, as the life supply, and as everything to the believers. We all have a part in such a marvelous dispensation. As believers we need to be brought up to God&rsquo;s standard, the standard set by the Apostle Paul.</p>
