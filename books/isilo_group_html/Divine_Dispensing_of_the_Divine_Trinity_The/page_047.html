<p>The Father is the source, the initiator, the Son is the expression, the accomplisher, and the Spirit is the entering in, the applier (John 14:17). The Father sent the Son (John 8:29), and the Son came with the Father (John 16:32). The Son sent the Spirit (John 16:7), and the Spirit came from with the Father (John 15:26) in the name of the Son (John 14:26). By this you can see that the Father by Himself cannot reach us, nor can the Son by Himself enter into us. The Father is unapproachable (1 Tim. 6:16), but the Son came to tabernacle among us (John 1:14). But still He was not able to enter into us because He was blood and flesh. As a man with a physical body He was able to be among His disciples, but not within them. So He told His disciples that He had to die and to be raised up. By His death and resurrection His form was changed from a physical form into a spiritual form. He became the pneumatic Christ who was able to enter into His disciples (John 20:22). This is the reaching of the Triune God.</p>
<p>When the Triune God reaches His redeemed people, He is the Spirit. For example, with electricity there is both the power plant and the installation in your house. Just to have the power plant is not practical. It is only when the power is installed into your house that the electricity becomes practical in your daily life. You are a building and God is the source, the power plant, in the heavens. The Spirit, the reaching of the Triune God, has been installed into your being. When the Spirit enters into your being, He does not leave the Father and the Son far away in the heavens. That is a wrong concept. When the Spirit comes into you, He comes with both the Son and the Father. If you have the Spirit, you have the Son. If you have the Son, you also have the Father. You have all Three. In the Father you taste love, in the Son you enjoy grace, and in the Spirit you participate in the communion, the fellowship, the flow, of the divine life. Love is the source, grace is the enjoyment, and the Spirit is the communion (2 Cor. 13:14). This is the dispensing of the Triune God.</p>
<p>When I was young I taught people that to be a Christian is, first of all, to fear God. You must have a holy fear toward God. Second, you must love the Lord Jesus. Third, you must endeavor to improve yourself to be good&mdash;a good husband, a good wife, a good child, a good father, a good mother, a good neighbor, a good student, etc. But now I want to tell you that a Christian is one who lives a life of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is not one who lives a life of good behavior. A Christian is one who lives a life of the Triune God. Today the very reaching of this Triune God into you is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). When the Spirit comes, He comes in the Son&rsquo;s name, and He comes with the Son and with the Father. So when you have this reaching Spirit, you have the Son. And when the Son comes to you, He comes in the name of the Father, and He comes with the Father. When you have the Son, you have the Father. Now you have all Three living in you as one to be your life, your life supply, your everything. As a Christian you don&rsquo;t need to take care of good behavior. Forget about that! You have to thoroughly and absolutely take care of the Triune God within you. He is so real.</p>
<p>When you call &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t you have a deep sensation of comfort, of light, of happiness, of peace, of consolation, of so many pleasant feelings? If you were to call on Abraham Lincoln or George Washington, nothing happens. But when you call &ldquo;Lord Jesus! I love You!&rdquo; you have the deep sensation that He loves you also and that He is living in you. This is not a superstition; this is a fact. The Spirit is the reality of the Triune God. When this reaching Spirit is in you, the entire God is in you.</p>
<p>A bonafide Christian is simply one who lives a life of this reality, a life of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. To live a life of the Triune God simply means to be one with the Triune God. As He moves, you move. As He speaks, you speak. As He stays, you stay. It is not a matter of ethics or of trying to overcome sin and the world. You just need to take care of Him. You just live a life of the Triune God. If you live such a life, the world will be judged, the Devil will flee, and all sinful things will be overcome. The Triune God becomes your life, your living, your victory, your holiness, your righteousness, your love, your life, and your light. This is a bonafide Christian with the divine ethics, much higher than the human. You need to live a life of the Triune God. The Spirit is the entering in and the applier of the Triune God. Our God is not only the source and not only the expression, but also the entering in. He has entered into our being.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
