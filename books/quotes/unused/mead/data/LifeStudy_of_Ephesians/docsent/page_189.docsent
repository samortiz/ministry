   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WATCHING A. For This Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 18 Paul goes on to speak of watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that we need to be watchful, on the alert, for this prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to be on guard lest we be robbed of time that should be devoted to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be watchful in a practical way, many in the churches set aside specific times to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To watch unto prayer implies that we exercise our will, calm our mind, and regulate our emotion in order to pray properly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It takes a considerable amount of exercise to make our mind, emotion, and will submissive and obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because many do not practice this, their mind is rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they tell the mind to calm down, it becomes all the more active.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others have trouble with the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to be those who exercise ourselves to such a degree that as soon as we have finished a long conversation we are able to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The need for such an exercise is implied in Paul s word about watching unto prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not watch unto our prayer life, we shall lose time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here and there throughout the day, our time will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may lose time because our time is neither scheduled nor controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are at work, our time may be closely regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But when it comes to prayer, many do not schedule their time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, much time which could be devoted to prayer is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not redeem our time and grasp every available opportunity, much time will be needlessly lost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although you may be very busy, do not use this as an excuse for not praying.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you place a high value on your prayer life, you will watch unto it and arrange time for it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No matter how busy you may be, you will still have time to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the examples in the Bible, it is better to have more than one time set aside for prayer daily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, Daniel prayed three times a day Dan 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Also the psalmist spoke of praying in the morning, at noon, and in the evening Psa 55:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we build up the habit of praying at regular times every day, great blessing will be brought in. This blessing will affect not only our personal lives, but also the church, our neighborhood, and even our nation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. In All Perseverance</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul charges us to watch unto prayer in all perseverance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To keep a prayer life we need all perseverance, a constant, persistent care.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have set aside a certain time in the morning for prayer, then you need to persistently watch regarding this time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not allow any distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may want to take the telephone off the hook for that period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we are not persistent in watching unto prayer, the enemy will send in many distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>C. In All Petition 1.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Concerning the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 18 Paul also speaks of petition concerning all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that we need to pray for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to watch unto our prayer life, we need to pray in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that we should pray particularly for our watching unto prayer, that is, pray for our prayer life, for our prayer time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also need to make petition concerning all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Consider how much time is required to pray for the saints in your locality and for the saints in other cities and countries.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning the Apostle a. That Utterance May Be Given to Him</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 19 Paul continues, And on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Greek word rendered utterance also means word, speech, expression.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul was asking the believers to pray that the word would be given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He desired to open his mouth with boldness to make known the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Paul needed both the word and the boldness to declare it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The mystery of the gospel is Christ and the church for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some Christians preach a gospel in which there is no mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Paul declared the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This mystery implies the entire New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Both Christ and the church are for God s economy, which also is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All these mysteries are related to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe that the Lord intends for a gospel preaching atmosphere to be developed in all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Pray for such an atmosphere to become prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In our gospel meetings we must do more than sing and tell others that Christ can meet their need for satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the contrary, we need to give full messages on the high things concerning God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Let us tell the unbelievers of God s eternal intention.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Do not underestimate their ability to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They may understand much more than you expect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Surely this kind of gospel preaching will draw unbelievers to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In our gospel meetings we need to both preach and teach.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should teach in a preaching atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Surely the saints will want to bring their relatives and friends to this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our burden is to make known the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Pray about this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Pray that the Lord will give us utterance and open our mouths with boldness to teach and to preach the mystery of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We all need to declare the gospel in this uplifted way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>That He May Speak Boldly</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, On the behalf of which I am an ambassador in a chain, that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul was an ambassador on behalf of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>An ambassador is one sent by a particular authority to contact certain people.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Paul considered himself an ambassador sent by God; he was one sent by the highest authority in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, he was an ambassador in a chain.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Greek word for chain is a term for the coupling chain, a chain which bound the prisoner to his guard.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Paul s desire was that in this coupling chain he might speak boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although Paul was chained to the one who guarded him, he nevertheless desired to speak boldly, as he ought to speak.</S>
