   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE EXERCISE YOURSELF UNTO GODLINESS Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-7; 3:15-16; 4:6-8; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22 A CLEAR VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is a book with many items, but within the many items there is a center, the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we look into the whole Bible, it may be very hard to find the kernel if we stay with our mentality and do not exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is just like the physical life in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can see the parts of the physical body such as the skin, the meat, the bone, and the muscle, but we cannot see the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regardless of what kind of instrument we would use, we could never see that life with our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Humanly speaking there is no way to see it and no way to make it manifest to our view.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we all know that this does not mean that there is not such a thing as physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The human physical life is more than real.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If it were not real, we could not speak and move.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have all the parts, but our ability to move is not in the physical, visible realm.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is in something that is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible is exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why many top scholars after reading the Bible see nothing of the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They see history and part of science.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others see some doctrines, stories, and prophecies, such as the big image with a golden head in Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The things concerning God's mystery and God's economy can only be revealed in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we exercise our spirit, then all these things will rise up within us as a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In my path of over fifty years of Christian life, I have passed through many things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am grateful for God's mercy that His grace has kept me in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But I can testify that one thing which preserves me all the time is a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A clear vision is the real preserving power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible has so many items, and Christianity has such a long history of nearly two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Christian religion has many books with thousands of opinions and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are in the Lord's recovery, and sooner or later some of the opinions will touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For instance, suppose you meet a Christian teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He may talk with you in a very nice way and ask if you know what the seventy weeks are in Daniel 9.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may be quite interested and like to listen, but this will cause you to be trapped.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This dear one may be a very eloquent speaker with a phonetic presentation to attract you to the seventy weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Fifty years ago I heard many messages on the seventy weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also, messages were given on the 1,260 days, the 1,290 days, and the 1,335 days.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These are all in Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is in the Bible, and this is the holy Word, but we may be trapped by a hunger for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE MYSTERY OF GODLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The two books to Timothy must be put together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The verses we have read are the very kernel of these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In these verses we have the word mystery mentioned again, but here the mystery is of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not another mystery; this is the same mystery which is the mystery of the universe, the mystery of God, and the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All of these are different aspects of one mystery, and this mystery in the two books to Timothy is called the mystery of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This word godliness means god-likeness, likening God, or like as God; that is, we have the appearance, the expression, and the manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The manifestation of God is called godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>So the mystery of godliness means that God in His mystery can be manifested and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Timothy tells us that godliness is God "manifested in the flesh" 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The mystery of godliness is God manifested in human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The mystery of God and the mystery of Christ are just God manifested in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God manifested in humanity is the mystery of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How much is implied and expressed in such a short word!</S>
