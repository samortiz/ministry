   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE DEALING WITH MARRIAGE LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 7:1-40</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 7:1-40 Paul comes to the fifth problem dealt with in this Epistle the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is treated according to the principles established in the preceding section 6:12-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times those who are most cultured are the ones who have the most problems in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those who are simple and uncultured may not have as many marriage problems.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you study the statistics related to divorces in this country, you will find that a large percentage of divorces is among those who are highly educated and among professional people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seems that the more educated a person is, the greater is the possibility of divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because the Corinthians were so devoted to their culture and philosophy, they had many questions about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul answers these questions in chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 7:1 begins in this way: Now concerning the things of which you wrote.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that the Corinthians had written to Paul about various matters, including marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The believers at Corinth had many questions because they were philosophical.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They philosophized about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is dangerous, however, to philosophize about our married life, for this can lead to separation or even divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brother Nee once advised us that after we get married, we should be blind regarding our spouse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do this, we shall enjoy married life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if we are watchful over our husband or wife in a critical, philosophical way, we shall have serious problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To analyze our married life is to philosophize concerning marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of analyzing our married life, we should simply enjoy it, praising the Lord and thanking Him for the spouse He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we praise the Lord in this way, the more we shall enjoy married life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Probably all those who are married have spent some time analyzing their marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may have said to ourselves, Was it really of the Lord that I marry this one?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Perhaps I was influenced too much by others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Maybe I should have waited a little longer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are honest, we shall admit that we have asked questions such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These questions arise because, deep within, we are not wholly satisfied with our married life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as every Christian has had doubts concerning his salvation, so every married person has had doubts about married life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, I do not encourage you to question your married life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am simply pointing out the fact that questions seem to be unavoidable, especially among those who are educated and highly cultured.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I. BASIC PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The best way to approach Paul s treatment of married life in this chapter is to consider the basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that this is the best way to understand the many points covered in chapter seven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A. Good for a Man Not to Touch a Woman</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first basic principle is found in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse Paul says, It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This depends upon the gift from God v. 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. Devoting Ourselves to Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Speaking to married believers, Paul says in verse 5, Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer and again be together, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek word rendered devote literally means have leisure, be free for; hence, to give oneself to.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Prayer requires that we be free from persons, matters, and things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any prayer that requires staying away from the spouse for a time must be special and heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Married life often distracts us from prayer and interferes with our prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It may even keep us from praying altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, there are unusual cases where a husband and wife help one another in the prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But for the most part, marriage is a distraction from the prayer life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>C. Giving No Occasion to Satan</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verse 5 Paul warns the married ones not to be tempted by Satan because of their lack of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The tempter, Satan, is crouching to capture the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their lack of self-control may give him the opportunity to do this.</S>
