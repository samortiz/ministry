<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
BY THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOUL</h2>

That Our Natural Disposition Be Dealt With</h2>
<p>The building up of the church is by the transformation of the soul (Rom. 12:2). As we have seen, we can be one not in ourselves but only in the conquering Christ. A sister may be very nice, humble, and gentle, but she may still be very natural. She may have a nice soul with a nice mind, a loving emotion, and a very soft will, but there may be only a small portion of Christ within her. It is difficult for a person with such a nice character and personality to be related in oneness with others. The most individualistic persons are the nicest ones. It is easier for even the sloppy ones to be one with others, because they are less individualistic.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a person who is nice and good in everything to find a companion. Whoever chooses the most proper person as his or her spouse will constantly suffer due to the spouse&rsquo;s individualism. A husband will never be able to come up to the standard of the most proper wife, and a wife will not be able to come up to the standard of the best gentleman. In the church I am more afraid of the nice ones than of the sloppy ones. The nicest ones are the most difficult to deal with. Nevertheless, whether we are sloppy or nice, we all must be conquered by Christ. Not only do those with bad dispositions need to be conquered by Christ, but those with even the best dispositions must be conquered. Otherwise, there is no possibility for us to be related with the other members of Christ. We can never be related to others in our self. We must be related in Christ. When we all are conquered by Christ, we spontaneously are related.</p>
<p>In actuality, it is not easy for Christ to take over either the nice ones or the sloppy ones. It is very difficult to build up the church due to the stronghold of these natural dispositions. The problem is not sin. Because everyone condemns sin, it is easy to overcome. However, not many condemn their disposition. More than twenty years ago there was a church in my hometown. At that time there were two brothers who were &ldquo;poles&rdquo; apart. One was very nice, and the other was sloppy. When the nice one came to someone&rsquo;s home, he would first knock on the door. When the owner answered the door, the brother would ask permission to come in, and when he was inside, he would wait to be offered a seat before he sat down. Then after he used a cup, he would return it to the proper place. He did everything nicely and in order. However, when the other brother came into a home, he would take his own seat, not where the guests sit but at the owner&rsquo;s desk. Then he would say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty.&rdquo; As he drank the tea, he would spill some on the floor, and when he was finished, he would leave the cup carelessly. Eventually, these two brothers argued with each other over the matter of disposition. One brother felt that the other&rsquo;s disposition was a hindrance to the Lord, and each one justified his own disposition.</p>
<p>This illustrates that everyone acts according to his own disposition with a certain amount of self-justification. In serving the Lord and dealing with many Christians in many places, I discovered that no one is willing to condemn his own disposition. This is why it is foolish to try to correct people. One brother may like to go to bed early and rise early, but the brother he lives with may not rise until an hour later. If these two try to correct one another, they will not succeed. Rather, each one will be fully offended and will want to move out. It is foolish to try to correct others in this way. If our roommate likes to go to bed late, we should let him do it and not bother him. We can never succeed to correct him. We can only offend people, and eventually we also will be offended.</p>

That Christ Take Full Possession of Our Soul<br />
and Swallow Up Our Disposition</h2>
<p>Our disposition is very troublesome. The only way to deal with it is for Christ to defeat it. If we love Him according to a heavenly vision and we give Him the glory, He will take full possession of us and He will swallow up our disposition. This swallowing up is the transformation of the soul. When our soul is transformed and our flesh is conquered, we will have true relatedness.</p>
<p>I am not passing on a mere doctrine about the building of the church. Rather, this is the practical experience for the building. The building of the church is possible only by the growth of life with the transformation of the soul. We need to be transformed by being conquered by Christ. The more we are willing to be conquered by Him, the more He will take over us and transform us in our soul. Then spontaneously we will have oneness among us. We will have the real building up of the church. This is what the enemy hates because this is the very thing that puts him to shame.</p>
