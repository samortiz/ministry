   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whirlwind</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The next item is the whirlwind v. 18 . A whirlwind is a type of wind that has no direction or peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In my background in Christianity, there was no direction or peace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Neither was there any direction or peace with the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With them there was just the whirlwind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Sound of a Trumpet</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the sight of the old covenant there is also the sound of a trumpet v. 19; Exo 19:13, 16, 19; 20:18 . The sound of a trumpet indicates a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Religion is filled with warnings, such as, Don t do this or you will go to hell, or, Be careful or you will lose your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In religion, they sound the warning trumpet much more often than they deliver a positive message.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Religion always says, Be careful don t do that, for in religion there are always many more don ts than do s. The sound of the trumpet is a sign of the poverty of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Religion has nothing positive to afford us; it can only warn us negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every religion, including Buddhism, Catholicism, and Protestantism, is the same in principle, sounding warnings and telling us what we should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Terrifying Voice of Words</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sixth item in the sight of the old covenant is the terrifying voice of words v. 19; Deut 4:12; Exo 19:19 . What people finally have in religion is the terrifying voice of words, not the jubilant praise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, in the church we always hear the praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. All Items Being Temporal</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because all the items in the sight of the old covenant were of the old dispensation they were temporal, not permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just as the old creation will one day pass away, so all the items of the old covenant, belonging to the old creation, have been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE SCENE OF THE NEW COVENANT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>ON THE SIDE OF GRACE A. Comprising Eight Items in Four Pairs</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we come to the scene of the new covenant on the side of grace vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This scene comprises eight items in four pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That these items are arranged in pairs is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The six items of the old covenant are presented singly, while the six items of the word of foundation in Hebrews 6 are arranged in three pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here, in chapter twelve, we have the eight items of the new covenant arranged in four pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The First Pair</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first pair consists of Mount Zion v. 22; Psa 2:6; Rev 14:1 and the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem v. 22; 11:10, 16; Rev 22:2 . Here there is no fire but a beautiful mountain with a glorious city, the heavenly Jerusalem, which is God s habitation and the center of His universal administration.</S>
