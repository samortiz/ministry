<h1 class="title">MAKING A PROFIT<br />
AND GIVING PEOPLE FOOD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CONSIDERATE OF ONE ANOTHER<br />
AND SHARING THE BURDEN</h2>
<p>In order for a training to be successful, the trainers and the trainees need to be blended together so that they can work together. It is difficult to carry out the training if the trainees are scattered. The church is under the administration and leadership of the elders, but because most of the elders have jobs, it is difficult for them to participate in the training. On the one hand, they bear the responsibility of being an elder in the church, and on the other hand, they work to support their families. In today&rsquo;s industrial and commercial society, earning a living can be compared to fighting a battle; everyone must endeavor, compete, and struggle for his existence.</p>
<p>We should not criticize the elders by asking why they do not attend the training or why they do not go door-knocking when the saints go door-knocking. The elders desire to participate in the training and to go door-knocking, but their situations do not allow them to do so. We are a family, and we should understand one another&rsquo;s situation and be considerate of one another. The trainers should be able to take care of the needs of the training, and the elders should bear their responsibilities. We should all function to meet the need through fellowship. When the elders lack the time to take care of the various needs, they should allow others to help them in the administration of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHANGING OUR CONCEPT BEING<br />
THE DIFFICULTY IN CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>It is difficult for us as human beings to change our concepts; hence, it is not easy to change the system. The 1911 revolution in China is an example. Nearly eighty years ago Sun Yat-sen led the revolution that overthrew the Manchu dynasty and established the Republic of China. However, the fact that there are still problems in China today indicates that the revolution was not entirely successful. This shows that it is not easy to change a system.</p>
<p>When I was a young student in Chefoo, Western influence was prevalent. There were many foreign consulates, and there were post offices for countries such as France, Japan, and Germany. I attended an American school that was founded by an American missionary board. The school was an international school with students from Korea, Russia, and other countries. Some of the students wore Western suits, but when they wore their suits outside the school premises, people insulted them. A person was also reviled if he spoke English. Thus, at that time I did not wear Western suits, and I dared not speak English. In 1949 when I came to Taiwan, I still wore Chinese-style clothes and shoes. I did not begin wearing Western suits until I traveled abroad, because it was difficult for me to change my conservative concept. Now it is natural for me to wear a Western suit. Related to English, even though I studied English as a youth, I still speak poorly because the environment did not allow me to practice. I was scolded whenever I spoke English. Now speaking English is a trend, and sooner or later everyone must learn to speak it.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s church has come to a standstill both in Christianity and in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery; there is no spread and no increase. Christianity has been in Taiwan for more than a century, but today only one person out of every forty is a Christian. Even in America Christianity is not spreading. This proves that the old system is wrong, because it kills the function of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEMINARY EDUCATION BEING DIFFERENT<br />
FROM THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Christianity emphasizes pastors and preachers. Therefore, there are many seminaries around the world. The seminaries all teach Old Testament Hebrew and New Testament Greek. This is good because both of these languages are useful. However, the seminaries do not teach classes that are according to the divine truth. In their history classes they consider matters such as whether the Pentateuch was written by Moses and whether the biblical record concerning Abraham is reliable. In their geography classes they research which lands belonged to Pharaoh and to other kings. In addition to these courses, they also teach psychology and philosophy. However, the more that people study psychology and philosophy, the further they are from God, and the more they feel that the Bible is not reliable.</p>
<p>What is taught in the seminaries is different from what we teach in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The Recovery Version of the New Testament and the Life-studies are full of light, life, and truth. Pastors and preachers graduate from the seminaries and teach the Bible, but people are often not satisfied with what they teach.</p>
<p>Seminaries emphasize the preaching of the gospel, and as a result, many people are saved. It is regrettable, however, that after their salvation these people cannot obtain an adequate supply of life. Seminaries also pay a great deal of attention to the methods of preaching the gospel, to sermons, and to managing the church. They also study how to be social, how to contact people, and how to understand human psychology. Even though the seminary students have the Bible in their hands, they may not understand the things in the Bible. They know what the Bible says concerning Abraham and Moses, but they do not fully believe or receive what is recorded in the Bible. Some believers think that the identity of the author of the book of Hebrews is still undetermined, but we are clear that Paul wrote Hebrews. These points show that Christianity is poor because it does not teach people to enter into the truth and revelation of the Bible. For this reason, we must change the system to ensure that the condition of the church meetings does not fall into the condition of Christianity.</p>
