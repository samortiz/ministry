   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE DRY BONES AND THE TWO STICKS Scripture Reading: Ezekiel 37:1-22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that Ezekiel 34 mainly covers the outward aspects of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God came in as the Shepherd to search and seek for His people and to bring them back to the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the outward aspect of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then Ezekiel 36 covers the inward aspect of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord not only brings us back outwardly, but also regenerates us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He gives us a new heart and a new spirit, and He puts His Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not merely a matter of outward position and outward circumstances, but it is also a matter of the inward nature and inward disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord's recovery is not something merely outward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even more, it is something inward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only were our position, our circumstances, and our surroundings changed, but we also had the inward renewing of a new heart, a new spirit, and we received the divine Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Outwardly there is a change, and inwardly there is a conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ezekiel 36, however, does not tell us clearly and thoroughly how we may have a conversion, a new heart, and a new spirit, and how we may obtain God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is simply mentioned in a general way that He will give us a new heart, a new spirit, and His own Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, we need Ezekiel 37 to tell us how God can renew us and regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>BEING DEAD AND DRY BONES</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, we need to realize that before God came in to renew us and regenerate us, we were like dead and dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we had only Ezekiel 36, we would realize that we were evil, bad, sinful, dirty, and filthy, but we would never think that we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ezekiel 37 says that not only were we dead, but we were also dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's salvation is not merely for sinful people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's salvation is for dead people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were not only sinful, but we were also dead and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we fell, whether as a sinner or a backslidden believer, in God's eyes we were buried in a grave.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We were in many graves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A gambling casino is a kind of grave; a movie is a kind of grave; hatred is a kind of grave.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before we were saved or before we were revived, we were buried in all those graves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We were not only sinful, but dead and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were fully dried up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We had no blood, no flesh, no sinew, no skin just dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a picture showing where we were and what we were to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Have you ever realized that you were not only sinful, but also dead and buried dry bones?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BEING SCATTERED</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because you were dead and dry, you were also scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not one piece of bone was drawn to another piece.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the bones were disjointed and scattered, having no oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether you were an unsaved sinner or whether you were a backslidden believer, this was exactly your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You were dead and buried in the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christians today are buried in the graves of denominations, in the graves of divisions, in the graves of free groups, and in the graves of so many movements.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these groups are graves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How do we know that these are graves?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can know because they are dead and dry, scattered and disjointed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are not connected to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>RECOVERY THROUGH PROPHESYING</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Praise the Lord, He did not leave us in that kind of situation, but He came in to rescue us!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord did not, however, come in directly to be the Shepherd, but He came in through Ezekiel and through the prophesying of His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many Christians have the wrong understanding about the meaning of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They think that to prophesy only means to predict.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But have you noticed that in Ezekiel 37 there is hardly any prediction?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, it is a matter of declaring something or speaking something forth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Prophesying in Ezekiel 37 does not mainly mean to predict; rather, it means to tell forth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It means a kind of declaration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Lord said to Ezekiel, "Son of man prophesy," it meant "Speak forth."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord told Ezekiel that when he prophesied, He would send the breath and the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When Ezekiel spoke forth, God gave people the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, we can see clearly that the main meaning of prophesying is not that of predicting, but of speaking forth something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Other Christians may think that to prophesy is to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But, no matter how much you teach dry bones, they remain dry bones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Ezekiel prophesied, speaking something for God, God followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As he was prophesying, God was blowing, sending the wind, the breath, and the Spirit.</S>
