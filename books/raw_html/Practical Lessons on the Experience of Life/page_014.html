<h2 class=head2>By Praying for Them</h2><p>In order to help someone in this way, we must pray for him to find one way or another to bring him through the crisis of consecration.<h2 class=head2>By Fellowshipping with Them</h2><h2 class=head3>Giving a Testimony of Consecration</h2><p>Then after we have a certain amount of prayer, we should fellowship with that person. Here we need the proper techniques. Of course, the way we take depends on the Lord’s leading at the time, but our fellowship will usually be in one of several ways. One way is to give him a testimony of consecration. We may give our own testimony, but to present  someone else’s testimony can also be effective.<h2 class=head3>Having a Fresh Sense of the Lord’s Loveliness</h2><p>A second way is to help him to realize the Lord’s love and how lovable He is. This is not easy to do. Many ministers realize that the most difficult message to give is one on the loveliness of the Lord. To speak of the Lord being faithful, great, or marvelous is easy, but some brothers may not be able to speak for five minutes on the loveliness of the Lord. To say something about the loveliness of the Lord requires that we have the fresh sense of His love. Someone may have love for a brother, for example, but after working with him for a year he no longer has a fresh sense of love. Even a husband and wife can lose the fresh sense of love. If we do not have a fresh sense, it is hard to speak about love. We may talk about love, but we may not have the power of inspiration.<p>The most effective way to help people to consecrate is to help them to realize the loveliness of the Lord. I have heard the testimony of a certain co-working sister many times. Every time she speaks of the Lord’s loveliness, she speaks with tears. With her there is always the freshness of the sense of His loveliness. I have never heard her testimony when I did not see many people weeping. She has caused thousands of people to consecrate themselves to the Lord.<h2 class=head3>Using the Proper Verses of the Scriptures</h2><p>The third way to fellowship with someone is to use the proper verses of the Scriptures. One of the best passages is 2 Corinthians 5:14 and 15, which say, “For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.” Another good passage is 1 Corinthians 6:19 and 20, which says, “Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body.” As we have seen, Romans 12:1 also speaks of presenting our bodies.
