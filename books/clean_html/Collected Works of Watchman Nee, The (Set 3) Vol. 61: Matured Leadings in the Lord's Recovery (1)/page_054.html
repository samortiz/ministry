<h2 class="head2">Voluntary Poverty for the Gospel's Sake</h2><p>More than one student is sitting here. I will say something to the young people as a whole. In all the Gospels God requires that we love the sinners and the poor from the bottom of our hearts. This is the reason the Lord said in Luke 4:18 that the poor have the gospel preached to them. In this world there are many poor people. We are not as poor as those who are genuinely poor. In the past we could say that we were the middle class, but there are not many people who now belong to the middle class anymore. There are many people who are much poorer than us. As we preach the gospel to them, we will find a great difference between us and them. This will make our preaching ineffective. A Christian must learn to take the way of voluntary poverty before he can preach the gospel effectively. We have to volunteer to become poor. We have to volunteer to forsake everything. Please remember that our Lord Jesus was rich but was made poor for our sake (2 Cor. 8:9). When our Lord came to preach the gospel, He became poor. If we do not become poor, we cannot preach the gospel. Today you are becoming poor for the first time for the Lord's sake. This is a sanctifying time for you. Tonight you are standing on new ground.</p><h2 class="head2">Building Up a Character of Giving</h2><p>A problem with human beings is our tendency to build up our preferences. The children of the devil walk according the desires of their heart (Eph. 2:3), but, as Christians, we have to learn to break down what we once cherished. We have to learn to give up what our heart loves. People in the world are worried that they have not taken enough from the world, but we must learn to drop what we love. We want to build up a proper Christian character gradually. If we continually drop what we love, we will become more like a Christian. In order to build up a Christian character, we have to learn to give up everything for the Lord at a young age. We have to learn to say, "I give this and that up because I love the Lord." We have to give away things again and again. While we are young, we should learn to not act according to our preference. Learn to give everything away. Only this kind of people will be able to preach the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Buffet the Body</h2><p>When we go to the villages, we have to dress like the villagers. Do not say anything about their filthiness or lowliness. We should be able to live in the cities as well as in the villages. If we cannot stand the villages, we are loving ourselves too much. We have disqualified ourselves from the gospel. In order to preach the gospel, we have to learn to deny ourselves. Some people dare not touch the tea offered to them in the villages. They wash and rinse the bowls that are offered to them. Such ones cannot preach the gospel. The Lord cannot use anyone who is selfish or self-loving. If we think that living in the villages will wear us out, we should move back to our original place; there is no need to stay there reluctantly and claim that we are preaching the gospel for the Lord's sake. We have to learn to live in a lowly way.</p><h2 class="head2">Budgeting Our Need and Offering Up the Rest</h2><p>Those who are living by their parents' income should learn to do one thing: They should find out before the Lord how much they actually need every month. They have to find out how much they need for pocket money and how much they need for food and for other uses. They must make an accurate calculation. From our youth we have to decide for ourselves the maximum amount we can spend. Before we spend any money, reckon carefully. While we are students, we should learn to budget every item of our expenses and then offer up the excess. There should be such a covenant between us and the Lord. If our parents give us more, we should offer it to the church for the gospel work in inland regions or for the poor.</p><h2 class="head3">Sister Bau</h2><p>All of your things are returned to you for your own use. We believe that your consecration before the Lord has been accepted by Him. However, if there are any items which your heart cherishes, you should give one or two of them to other sisters. This is for your own good. If you have extra clothing, you can ask the church to help you to send them to Yi-Yang or Kuling. There are over thirteen hundred brothers and sisters everywhere who are in need.</p><h2 class="head3">Sister Yang</h2><p>The two watches that you handed over can be given to younger sisters. Find out who does not have a watch and give these to them. If any item is a cherished object, you should give it to a faraway place. Everything you have in your house should be things that you need. If you do not need something, do not develop a habit of buying it. I say this because none of the things you consecrated are particularly valuable. The church is handing these things back to you. You should do your best to keep this principle month by month. Do not spend easily. Always buy only what you need.</p>
