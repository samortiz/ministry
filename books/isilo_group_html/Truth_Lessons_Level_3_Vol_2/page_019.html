THE LEPROUS GARMENT,<br />
AND THE LEPROUS HOUSE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The cleansing of the leper:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The leper being brought to the priest.</li>
	<li>The priest going outside the camp to examine the leper.</li>
	<li>The leper who was to be healed needing to seek cleansing before God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>With two living clean birds.</li>
		<li>With cedar wood and hyssop.</li>
		<li>With scarlet strands.</li>
		<li>In an earthen vessel in which one bird was to be slaughtered over running water.</li>
		<li>The other bird, the cedar wood, the scarlet strands, and the hyssop being dipped in the blood of the killed bird that it might be sprinkled seven times on the leper who was to be cleansed, and the living bird being allowed to go free over an open field.</li>
		<li>Washing his clothes, shaving off all his hair, and bathing himself in water.</li>
		<li>Dwelling outside his tent seven days.</li>
		<li>On the seventh day shaving off all the hair from his whole body, washing his clothes, and bathing his flesh in water.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The leper who was to be cleansed needing to solve the problem of his sin and sins before God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Offering one of the male lambs for a trespass offering, with the log of oil, both of which were waved for a wave offering before Jehovah.</li>
		<li>The male lamb as the trespass offering to be slaughtered in the place of the sanctuary where the sin offering and the burnt offering were slaughtered.</li>
		<li>The blood of the trespass offering to be put on the lobe of the right ear of him who was to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.</li>
		<li>Some of the oil to be poured into the palm of the priest&rsquo;s left hand and sprinkled with his right finger seven times before Jehovah.</li>
		<li>Some of the rest of the oil to be put on the lobe of the right ear of the one who was to be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of the right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering.</li>
		<li>The rest of the oil in the priest&rsquo;s palm to be put on the head of him who was to be cleansed.</li>
		<li>The sin offering to be offered to make expiation for him who was to be cleansed because of his uncleanness.</li>
		<li>The burnt offering to be offered with the meal offering.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The cleansing of the leprous garment:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If the infection was spreading in the garment, the garment to be burned in fire.</li>
	<li>Washing the garment if the infection had not spread.</li>
	<li>Burning the garment with fire if it was a leprous decay.</li>
	<li>The infected spot that has faded to be torn out of the garment.</li>
	<lI>Burning the garment after the infected spot was torn out of the garment and the infection broke out again in the garment.</li>
	<li>After the infection had departed through washing, the washed garments to be washed a second time for them to be clean.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The cleansing of the leprous house:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the same way as the cleansing of leprosy in a man.</li>
	<li>Purging the house with the blood of the bird and the living water.</li>
	<li>Letting the living bird go into the open field.</li>
	<li>The house being clean.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>A concluding word.</li>
