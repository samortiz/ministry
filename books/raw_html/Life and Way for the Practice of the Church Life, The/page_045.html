<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ATTITUDE AND RELATIONSHIP<br>OF THE WORKERS</H1><P>In the previous chapter, we mentioned something concerning the attitude and relationship of the workers. In this chapter we will continue to cover this matter in a more thorough way.</P><P>Most of the divisions among Christians were brought in by the workers. The history of the church shows that the more workers were raised up by the Lord, the more divisions were created. No doubt, John Wesley was a person greatly gifted by the Lord, but I regret to say that even he brought in a division, the so-called Methodist church. We have to learn the lesson from history.</P><P>All the workers are in a dangerous position of bringing in a sect. Many times I have said to myself that it is dangerous and tempting for us, the workers, to bring in some sects and cause some divisions. Today a number of us brothers are learning to serve the Lord. We hope that the Lord would grant us not only a gift but also a ministry and that we could be used by the Lord. But we have to be very careful. Otherwise, perhaps after fifteen years there will be as many sects as the number of full-time co-workers we have here today. If we have seven or eight workers today, we could have seven or eight sects fifteen years from now. From history we can see that nearly all the gifted persons were sect creators. There was hardly any exception.</P><P>We brothers who are workers of the Lord need to be clear that if we are not careful we will be the sect creators. The more we work, the more we do, and the more we labor, the more we are in danger of creating a sect. Furthermore, the more we are used by the Lord, the greater is the danger of our creating a sect.</P><P>We saw in the past, again and again, that on the one hand, the gifted persons rendered much help to the church, yet on the other hand, the gifted persons perplexed and, to some extent, damaged the church. On the one hand, the saints received great benefit through the gifted persons, but on the other hand, the saints were perplexed and complicated by the gifted persons.</P><P>Because of this, you have to learn how to receive the ministry, the help, from the gifted persons and how to discern the help from the complication. Do not follow the ministry or the workers blindly. Do not say, "I receive a great help from this person. Everything is all right. I just follow him." You should not do this. You should not follow anyone blindly or reject anyone blindly. You need to have the discernment. Anything of one's ministry that is profitable and helpful, you should receive; whatever is complicating and perplexing, you should reject.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR WORK BEING TO MINISTER CHRIST<br>AND TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</H2><P>Dear brothers, as the workers, as the servants of the Lord, in the New Testament age, first, you have to see that your work, your ministry, is to preach or minister Christ and to build up the church. These two items must be the governing rules. Wherever you go and whatever you do, you must be governed, ruled, by these two items.</P><P>You should not go to any place to preach immersion or predestination. What you should preach and minister is Christ Himself. God has no intention to tell people about immersion or predestination. God also has no intention to tell people about prophecy. If prophecy is a help for people to know Christ, that is all right. But if that becomes a factor to draw people away from Christ, you have to give it up. The ministry of the Lord's servants in this present age is nothing else than to preach and minister Christ to others and to build up the church. You should not preach anything but Christ, and you should not work for the building up of your work, your ministry, but for the building up of the church. If any servant of the Lord breaks these two rules, you can be assured that he is sectarian. This is something very basic, about which we all need to be clear.</P><P>We are sent by the Lord to preach Christ either as the Savior to the sinners or as the all-inclusive Christ to the saints. We have to preach, to minister, Him to people with the building up of the church in view. If the view of your work is to enlarge and build up your ministry, that is absolutely wrong. You must preach Christ with only one intention, one purpose, and that is to build up the saints as a local church to express Christ in a corporate way.</P>
