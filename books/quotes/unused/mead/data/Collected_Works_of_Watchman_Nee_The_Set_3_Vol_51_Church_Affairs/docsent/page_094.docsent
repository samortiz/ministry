   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Submitting Selectively</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is not a matter of receiving one authority, nor a matter of receiving ten authorities; it is a matter of receiving authority.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me give you an example.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have used two servants.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They started working for me at different times, one earlier than the other.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the first one came to my house, I charged him saying, "There is a basic requirement for you to be a servant you need to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No matter how smart you are, just do whatever I ask you to do.''</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later, I also told the other servant, "You need to learn to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You need to listen to me, and you also need to listen to the servant who came before you.''</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the servant who came later obeyed all of my words, but he did not obey the words of the servant who came earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He always tried to find ways to point out the mistakes of the other servant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you think that this person submitted to authority?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is submission to authority?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Submission to authority does not mean choosing the person to whom you will submit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you choose the person to whom you will submit, you do not know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He who knows authority recognizes it whenever he encounters it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he encounters it, he knows he should submit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you cannot submit, it proves that you have never known authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may have submitted to man, but not to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At best you merely fear a man, and when you meet him you obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You have never been under authority because you have never known authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Authority is not a matter of one place or another place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is authority in every place and on every occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regardless of where one may be, he who knows authority recognizes it whenever he encounters it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When a person is under authority, individualism cannot exist.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you stand on the ground of individualism, you will have no way to submit yourself to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a very important matter as far as spiritual principles are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A person needs to learn to know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For Christians it is not a matter of who a person is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christians should submit to authority whenever we encounter it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Seeking Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Individualism cannot exist if one seeks fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With individualism one always tries to maintain his individual spiritual life before God, his individual visions before God, and his individual work before God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is always an individual; it is not easy for him to seek fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a person does not seek fellowship, but struggles and labors by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many children of God today can say only in words that they cannot do without other brothers or that they must have the church in order to live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, many can live without the church and without fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that they are individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If a person receives the principle of fellowship and the principle of the Body only in concept, yet in actuality lives and works by himself, has a spiritual life without fellowship, and does the work of the Lord without fellowship, then this person has never been broken before God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is altogether an individualistic person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fellowship is versus individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not what you say about fellowship; rather, it is a matter of whether fellowship is a part of your life, whether you really cannot live or work without fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day God will bring you to this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I feel that this is the greatest step.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not Merely a Matter</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>of Lacking Faithfulness and Faith</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When many people come to an impasse, they only consider that there are problems with their faith or faithfulness; they do not consider that there is a problem with their fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The education which many people have received in the past and the books which many have read instruct people to be faithful, to believe, and to submit directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, a problem occurs when they are unable to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they cannot get through in their personal lives, they always consider that they themselves have a problem, that their faith has a problem, or that they are lacking in faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is right, but many only see that their failures and difficulties are due to problems in their personal faith, their personal faithfulness, or their personal submission.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They do not see that there is something else in the Bible called fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If there are problems with fellowship, they can also arrive at the same point of failure and difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people's problems have nothing to do with the matter of faith or believing in God, but the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sometimes the Lord must allow this kind of person to struggle in his faith, faithfulness, and submission so that he reaches a point in his Christian life where he simply cannot believe or submit no matter how hard he tries.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Perhaps he will then realize that he cannot make it simply as one member, nor can he make it merely by his union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He must be joined with the Body of Christ in order to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps he will then begin to see that he needs the help of other Christians in order to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many have not yet been brought on this way; they are still walking on the way of individualism, laboring by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is God's great mercy to bring a person to a point where he cannot get through, and where his eyes are opened to see that while submission, faith, and faithfulness do not suffice, fellowship does suffice.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a great revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day God's children will be brought to a stage where all their ways are exhausted, and where they see that even such a great item as faith does not avail.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Faith is not a small matter, and we should not despise it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Faith, faithfulness, and submission are all great matters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, one day you will reach a point that even when all these conditions are fulfilled, you still cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Faith, faithfulness, and submission to God are all weighty matters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But even with these weighty things, you still have no way to get through until your eyes are opened one day and you begin to realize that fellowship is also a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without fellowship, you cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only a person who has passed through this pathway before God can escape individualism, not doing things individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who only know the doctrine of fellowship or the doctrine of the Body of Christ can still be individualistic for the rest of their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They can believe in the doctrine of fellowship in a very individualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God needs to bring them on a path where everything is exhausted, where the way is impassable, and where their problems still cannot be solved even though they continue to believe, be faithful, and submit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When God gives them a little light one day, they will see that their problem was actually in the matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then their individualism will depart.</S>
