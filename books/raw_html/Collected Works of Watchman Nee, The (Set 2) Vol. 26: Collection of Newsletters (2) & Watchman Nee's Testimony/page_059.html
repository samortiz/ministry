<h2 class="head1">LETTERS FROM HANGCHOW</h2><h2 class="head2">One</h2><p>Greetings to Brother Witness:</p><p>I was just thinking of you, when I suddenly received your letter. (Parts omitted.) According to my plan, I intended to go to Shanghai to be instructed, but because of different kinds of frustrations, I am unable to fulfill my wish this week. On the Lord's Day, February 3, Hangchow is having a fellowship and baptism meeting, so the brothers will not let me go. (Parts omitted.) I hope you will pray for me and instruct me. May you have peace! Greet Brother Chang Kuang Jung also!</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Philip Luan<br />January 31</p><h2 class="head2">Two</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved brother in the Lord, Witness:</p><p>(Parts omitted.) The conference in Hangchow will be from the third to the ninth. Every evening there will be a message for outsiders. On the tenth I must go with Brother Kuang Jung to Hua She and Yi Lung to visit the brothers. For this reason I am afraid I will not be able to go to Shanghai to receive some teaching. I only ask you to pray for these matters. May you be blessed with peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Philip Luan<br />February 7</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM SOOCHOW, KIANGSU PROVINCE</h2><p>To my brother in the Lord, Witness:</p><p> May you have peace!</p><p>Although the meeting in Soochow is often attacked from every side, thank God that He still preserves His work. On the surface it seems that the enemy is very strong. We are not clear why we suffer these things, but we believe that His actions are never wrong and that we will understand fully later. But, brother, our hearts are almost sinking. On the surface it appears that we are full of failures; we hope that you will help us in prayer. Brother, I really want to see you and gain some help. May you have peace!</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Stephen Kaung<br />February 15, 1935</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM BROTHER CHEN CH'ING FA<br />IN P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</h2><p>Greetings in love to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Witness:</p><p>I received your card on January 14. I learned something of your recent travels from it. May the Lord bless your work in Shanghai and all your family in Chefoo. After shaking hands and saying good-by to you in Shanghai, my life and work have been as usual. I travel around to the meeting places in the region of Chiang Nan visiting the brothers. Eight days after the Chinese New Year, there will be an edification meeting for the believers in Shui Shen Yang in Chiang Nan. Please pray for this, that the Lord's Word would run freely without frustration so that God's children may be established by the Lord's Word.</p><p>Why has the publication work stopped for so long? I have not seen The Present Testimony or The Christian for several months! I really miss them. If possible, please tell me why so that I will know how to pray. (Parts omitted.) May you have peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chen Ch'ing Fa<br />January 31</p><h2 class="head2">Note from Witness</h2><p>With regard to the publication work, please read "News Briefs from Various Places."</p>
