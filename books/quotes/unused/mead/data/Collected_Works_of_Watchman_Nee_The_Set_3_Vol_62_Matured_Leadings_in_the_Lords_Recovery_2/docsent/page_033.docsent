   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY THE WHOLE CHURCH SERVING Date:Evening, February 24, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Jordan Road, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Speakers:Watchman Nee, Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading:Eph 4:11-12, 16 EXPLANATION OF A HYMN</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Watchman Nee: What is a hymn?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A hymn is the expression of a person's spiritual sentiments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When a man expresses his spiritual sentiments in songs, many times his mind is not very clear, but his spirit is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example in Hymns, #974, it is unclear whether the "he" refers to the Lord, to Abraham, or to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are all mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whatever it may be, we can touch the spirit of this hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>HANDING OVER TO RUN THE CHRISTIAN RACE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After you have believed in the Lord, you have to deal with two things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Formerly, sin followed and entangled you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You were not able to free yourself from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once you believed in the Lord, your sinful acts were forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now you must also deal with sin itself so that you can be free from its domination.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second category includes things that should be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to deal with all the things you have acquired from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some of these things relate to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others are not related to sin, but are a burden and hindrance to running the Christian race.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these have to be dealt with and cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hebrews 12:1-2 says that in running the race, a Christian must first put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No one runs a race wearing an overcoat and dress shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one runs with things in his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same way, after a man believes in the Lord, he has to sell everything, forsake all, and remove every hindrance to run the race before him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How do we deal with the things that are still in our hands?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When men went to John the Baptist to ask what they should do, he replied, "He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise" Luke 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Anything that we owe others should be returned with recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have acquired our fortune by unjust means, it is wrong to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is equally wrong to spend it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to deal with it in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everything that we own and everything in our house must be dealt with and cleaned up thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a Christian wants to run the race before him, he has to deal immediately with the many burdens that entangle him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Forsaking everything is not only an expression of our love for the Lord; it is mainly for the purpose of preparing us to run our Christian race properly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that a man cannot be a Christian if sin remains in him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But if many material things remain in him, he cannot be a Christian either.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sin in us will hinder us from living a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In principle, material things remaining with us also will hinder us from living a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sin makes us sick organically; material things make us sick functionally.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Things that the brothers and sisters own, such as gold, silver, precious items, jewelry, etc., must be handed over.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Concerning the lands and houses that the saints have handed over, there should be suitable arrangements and proper disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians have lived loosely and carelessly in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today they can no longer be so reckless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In these days, the brothers and sisters must be very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all must learn to be absolute and strict Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We believe that the church is beginning to take the final step of God's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May we do well in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord that He has put us in this rich age.</S>
