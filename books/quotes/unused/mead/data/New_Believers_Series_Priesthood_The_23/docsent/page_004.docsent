   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING A MEDIATORIAL CLASS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From Exodus until the time of the Lord Jesus on earth, no other tribe could function as priests except the tribe of Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They could not offer sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their sacrifices had to be made through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They could not even come to God to confess their sins; they had to confess them through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They could not separate themselves from the world because they had no authority to touch the anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The priests alone could anoint and sanctify a person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the spiritual services had to be carried out by the priests on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One special characteristic about the Israelites in the Old Testament was that God was far away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not everyone could contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Old Testament we find the evolution of the priesthood, which I call an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man could not go to God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's people had to go through the priests before they could draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They could not commune with God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God came to man through the priests, and man also went to God through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Between God and man, there was a mediatorial class.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man could not come directly to God, and God could not come directly to man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Between God and man there was a mediatorial class.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This class was not found in God's original design.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's original intention was to approach His people directly and for them to come to Him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But now there were three parties.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The people had to come to God through the priests, and God had to approach His people through the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God and man could no longer commune with each other directly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All contact became indirect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CHANGE IN THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For about fifteen hundred years, from the time of Moses to the time of Christ, God's people were unable to come directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only one household was qualified to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A man had to belong to this household to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If he drew near to God directly, he would die.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During that period, the ministry of the priests became a very powerful ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man could not come to God directly; he needed the intercession of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How noble and great the priestly ministry was!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There was no way for man to come to God without the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But with the coming of the New Testament age, we find salvation and redemption reaching all men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we hear the word: "You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A. Every Redeemed One Being a Priest</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>in the New Testament Dispensation</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1 Peter 2:4-7 Peter tells us that Christ is the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was the stone rejected by the builders who has now become the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have become the living stones and are joined and built up to become a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also have become a holy priesthood to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is as if a voice from heaven burst forth announcing, "All who are saved are now God's priests.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the living stones, those who are part of the spiritual house, are now priests of God."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>B. The Church Recovering</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>the Universal Priesthood Again</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Right then a promise which had been set aside for fifteen hundred years was recovered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What the Israelites lost has been recovered by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The universal priesthood was lost to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the New Testament age, it is as if a voice from heaven bursts forth with the promise that the universal priesthood is with us once more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the saved ones are called to be priests.</S>
