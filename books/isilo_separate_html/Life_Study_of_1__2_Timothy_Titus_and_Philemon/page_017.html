Their Salvation</h2><p>In verse 15 Paul concludes, &#8220;But she shall be saved through childbearing, if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.&#8221; Childbearing is a suffering. Suffering restricts and protects the fallen one from transgression.<p>The grammar in verse 15 is rather unusual. At the beginning of the verse Paul says, &#8220;She shall be saved&#8221;; then he goes on to say, &#8220;if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.&#8221; The pronoun &#8220;she&#8221; refers to Eve in verse 13. The reason Paul changes from a singular to a plural pronoun was that in referring to Eve he was including all women. Not all women are included in the pronoun &#8220;she,&#8221; but none can deny that they are included in the pronoun &#8220;they.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s use of pronouns in this verse makes it clear that in speaking of Eve he is speaking of all women.<p>In verse 15 Paul mentions faith, love, and holiness. Faith is to receive the Lord (John 1:12), love is to enjoy Him (John 14:21, 23), and holiness is to express Him through sanctification. By faith we please God (Heb. 11:6), by love we keep the Lord&#8217;s word (John 14:23), and by holiness we see Him. (Heb. 12:14).<p>In this message I am especially burdened concerning modesty, the leading female virtue. In some families there is not adequate stress on modesty. Rather, both boys and girls are brought up and instructed in the same way. Modesty is a virtue which emphasizes the difference between male and female. As we have pointed out, the Greek word rendered &#8220;modesty&#8221; in 2:9 is literally shamefastness, that is, bound and made fast by an honorable shame.<p>A word related to the virtue of modesty is shamefacedness. To be shamefaced is to be modest and have a sense of shame and know how to show shame. When a sister speaks in a church meeting, she should do so with modesty, with a certain amount of shamefacedness.<p>Modesty is a great safeguard and protection to a female. It is a mistake to teach girls in the same way as boys. Boys may expose themselves in certain situations; girls, however, should not. Otherwise, they will be without protection. This lack of protection can open the way for fornication. If the women working in an office have the virtue of modesty, they will be free from any improper involvement with the men who work there. A woman working in an office may easily become involved with a man if she does not have the proper covering, the necessary modesty, shamefacedness, which causes her to keep a proper distance.<p>All the sisters in the church life should have the virtue of modesty. The sisters should dress according to the principle of modesty. This principle does not allow the exposure of one&#8217;s body. For a woman to expose her body is to go against the principle of modesty. A sister needs to have a head covering, not only physically, but also psychologically, ethically, morally, and spiritually. This is the modesty spoken of in the Bible. To be modest simply means that a female is fully covered in every way.<p>In the church life the brothers and sisters have quite a lot of contact with one another in fellowship. In such fellowship it is necessary for the sisters to wear a moral, ethical, and spiritual covering known as modesty. In all their contact with the brothers, the sisters should be covered with an &#8220;overcoat&#8221; of modesty. This is a great safeguard and protection.<p>The sisters should never forget that they are females. This must be true especially of young unmarried sisters. They should be careful not to allow any evil thing to defile their holy body, which has been separated unto God and which is the temple of the Holy Spirit. For a young woman to preserve her body in this way requires modesty. I advise all the young sisters to wear a heavenly cloak to cover themselves from the influence of this evil age. Then they will be preserved for God&#8217;s purpose. At the time appointed by God, He will arrange for the right brother to marry a young sister as a virgin. Again and again I would remind the sisters to wear a cloak of modesty. The sisters must always remember that they are females. As females it is necessary for them to be covered. This is modesty.<p>Along with modesty, the sisters need sobriety (2:9). As a sister is practicing modesty, she needs to be sober. Far from being foolish, she should be sober-minded and discreet. She should be clear about things and have a keen discernment. A sister should be quiet, but she should not be without sobriety and discernment. A sister should be quiet soberly, not foolishly. As a sister exercises herself to be quiet and not to overstep her position, she needs a keen discernment within. Her spiritual sky should be clear, without clouds or smog. Then she will be clear, careful, and discreet.<p>The two virtues of modesty and sobriety are of great importance in the church life. The sisters should attend the church meetings in order to gain the full knowledge of the truth. This knowledge will cause them to be sober in their understanding. Then, along with their modesty, they will have what Paul calls &#8220;holiness with sobriety&#8221; (2:15). They will not be holy in a foolish way, in a way devoid of knowledge. On the contrary, they will be holy in a way that is full of knowledge, understanding, and discernment.<p>In the first two chapters of 1 Timothy Paul gives practical instructions to have a proper local church: (1) terminate the distraction of differing teachings (1:3-11); (2) emphasize God&#8217;s dispensation, making it the central line and goal of the Christian life (1:4-6); (3) preach Christ to save sinners (1:12-17); (4) war a good warfare for God&#8217;s New Testament economy by holding faith and a good conscience (1:18-19); (5) deal with the heretical teachers and the opposers of the apostle (1:20); (6) let the leading ones take the lead to have a prayer life, interceding for all men that Christ&#8217;s redemption may be testified in due time (2:1-7); (7) let the brothers follow the pattern of prayer, praying all the time (2:8); and (8) let the sisters adorn themselves in proper deportment and subject themselves to the brothers, remaining in quietness, faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
