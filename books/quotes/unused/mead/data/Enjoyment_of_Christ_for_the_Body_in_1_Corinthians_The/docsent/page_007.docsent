   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BEING THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter 2 Christ is the deep things of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>7-10 things which eye has not seen, ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nuclear science and the knowledge required to land men on the moon are all superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have something deeper, the deep things of God, which are simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whoever does not have Christ in him is shallow and superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hallelujah, we have something hidden, mysterious, and deep within us!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>People may ask us, What happened to you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why you are so happy?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Did you earn a high degree or get a better job?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Did you win a prize or receive a gift?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are happy because we have something that is very deep and mysterious Christ as the deep things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the sixth item of the riches of Christ in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>CHRIST BEING THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OUR PASSOVER FEAST, AND OUR SPIRITUAL FOOD, SPIRITUAL DRINK, AND SPIRITUAL ROCK</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is also the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church 3:10-11 , our Passover feast for our enjoyment 5:7-8 , and our spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual rock 10:3-4 , which are the seventh through eleventh items of Christ s riches in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Truly, the Lord is rich to all who call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By calling, O Lord Jesus, we enjoy Him as the power and wisdom of God, as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption, and as the deep things of God, the foundation, the Passover, and our spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual rock.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, the way to partake of all these riches of Christ is to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>CHRIST BEING THE HEAD,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE FIRSTFRUITS, THE SECOND MAN,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE LAST ADAM, THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE BODY, AND THE BODY-CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After this group of eleven items of what Christ is, there are another seven items.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the Head of every man 11:3a , the firstfruits 15:20, 23 , the second man v. 47b , the last Adam, and the life-giving Spirit v. 45b . Since Christ is the first, the second, and the last, He is everything, and He is every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As our everything, He takes our position; that is, He is everything, and we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we have all been put into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are nothing in ourselves, but we have everything in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may never have dreamed that Christ is so much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, Christ is not only the Head but also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 12 of chapter 12 says, Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most Christians realize that Christ is the Head, but they do not consider that He is also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the concept we received from Christianity, we consider that Christ is the Head and that the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Strictly speaking, however, this is a wrong concept.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is wrong to say that a man s head is the man himself but that his body is someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man is a whole person, including his head and his body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, Christ is a complete person, both the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since Christ is both the Head and the Body, He is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This simply means that He is no longer only the individual Christ; He is also the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ has an individual aspect and a corporate aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Individually, He is Christ, and corporately, He is the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the Lord s table there are the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The bread signifies Christ s body in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, it signifies the physical body of Jesus, in which He was pierced, crucified on the cross, and shed His blood for us, and second, it signifies the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The mystical Body of Christ is the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we partake of the bread at the Lord s table, we are eating not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We enjoy the mystical Body of Christ, and we participate in the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>THE PROPER CHURCH LIFE ISSUING FROM</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>OUR ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have seen, 1 Corinthians tells us that we need to enjoy and partake of all the riches of Christ by calling, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way He becomes our power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, the deep things of God, the foundation, the Passover, our spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual rock, the Head, the firstfruits, the second man, the last Adam, the life-giving Spirit, the Body, and the Body-Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The issue of this enjoyment of Christ is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The way to have the church life is not to receive doctrinal teachings and be corrected and adjusted in the way of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Organizing can produce a society, but it can never produce the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Body comes out of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By our calling on this rich Christ, on the Lord who is rich to all, He enters into us, and we digest and assimilate Him so that He comes into every part of our being to be our organic element, even to become us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Books on nutrition tell us that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we eat fish and chicken every day, we will eventually be constituted with fish and chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the same way, if we eat Jesus, we will eventually become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul says, To me, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To us, to live is Christ, because we eat Christ day by day and hour after hour.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Eventually, we all become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since there is only one Jesus, the more we eat Jesus and become Him, the more we will be in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the church we are enjoying not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.</S>
