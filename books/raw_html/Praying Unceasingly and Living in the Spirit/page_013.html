        <h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT<br />
BEING EQUIVALENT TO ABIDING IN THE LORD</h2>
<p>In John 14:10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am in the Father and the Father is in Me,&rdquo; and He also said, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.&rdquo; In verses 16 and 17 the Lord said, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality;...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; In verse 20 the Lord said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; These verses concern the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In verse 23 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; This verse mentions the mutual abode of the Triune God and the believers.</p>
<p>In chapter 15 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman&rdquo; (v. 1). The Son is the vine, and the Spirit is the reality of this vine. The Lord wants us to abide in Him, because we are branches grafted into Him. As believers, we have already been grafted into the Lord; hence, there should not be any separation between us and the Lord. If we abide in Him, He will abide in us (v. 4). In chapter 17 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us&rdquo; (v. 21). This refers to our being joined as one spirit to the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in our spirit. This is abiding in the Lord. When we are joined to the Spirit, we abide in the Lord, and the Lord abides in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE SPIRIT TO KILL THE PROBLEMS<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When we live in our spirit and allow the Spirit to live in us, the flesh, the self, and the natural constitution will lose their ground in us. We are thankful to the Lord for His grace and mercy to us, but we have to admit that there is still discord among the serving ones in the churches. The only way to kill such discord is to live in the spirit. When we live in the spirit, all the problems disappear. We do not care whether others are right or wrong, good or bad. We only care to live in the spirit. Living in the spirit is the cure to heal people and to swallow up the death in the church. Everyone thinks that someone else is wrong, because when we are not in the spirit, we are in the realm of right and wrong.</p>
<p>We do not need judges among us; we only need those who live in the spirit. When we live in the spirit, there will be no problems. We blame and criticize others because no person is good. Which elder is good? Which local church is good? No one is good, because we are all descendants of Adam. If we are in the spirit, however, we will not pay attention to whether others are good or bad. If we are not in the spirit, we will always complain about the faults of the elders and the church, no matter where we may be. It might be true that the elders and the church are not good, but focusing on this shows that we are in our natural constitution, not in the spirit. If we are in the spirit, we will overflow with life instead of speaking negatively.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE URGENT NEED FOR PRAYER</h2>
<p>Our present need is prayer. We should not pray only for others and the churches; we need to pray for ourselves. This means that we need to pray ourselves into the spirit so that we would be joined to the Lord as one spirit and remain in the spirit. We need to serve in the spirit and pray in the spirit without considering the result or what to do next. The present need of the church is for the saints to live in the spirit. There is only one reason for the problems in the church: the saints do not live in the spirit. As soon as the saints begin living in the spirit, the problems will disappear. Therefore, we must live in the spirit and remain in the spirit through prayer.</p>
<p>After many years we are finally realizing that although it might be effective to make arrangements or to deal with the problems in the church, the solution is for the saints to live in the spirit. If we will live in the spirit, we will not need to deal with things or make arrangements, because the problems in the church will spontaneously be resolved. May we know and practice living in the spirit and bringing others into the spirit. This is the only way for the spiritual reality to increase among us. If we do not practice living in the Spirit, we will not have the reality of the Spirit within us, even if we understand the Bible. We are short of the reality of the Spirit because we do not live in the spirit. Our problem is a lack of prayer; we do not spend enough time in prayer; hence, our living is a living without prayer. We like to do many things, but we are not willing to pray more. The urgent need in the churches is more prayer. Prayer will cause us to live in the spirit, that is, to abide in the Spirit and abide in the Lord.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
