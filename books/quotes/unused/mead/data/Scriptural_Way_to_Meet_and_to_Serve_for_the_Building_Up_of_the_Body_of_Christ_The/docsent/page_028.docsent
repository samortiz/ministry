   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Psalm</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our speaking in the apostles teaching according to the practice at Paul s time can be by a psalm, a teaching, a revelation 1 Cor 14:26 , an exhortation Heb 10:25 , or an admonition Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul lists a psalm, a teaching, and a revelation in 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A psalm is a poetic piece according to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A part of the apostles teaching put into poetry by the saints is a psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter ones, and spiritual songs are the shortest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In our hymnal, a few hymns may be considered as psalms #187 has twenty-six verses and #188 has twenty-two verses .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The longest psalm in the Bible is Psalm 119, which is composed in twenty-two sections according to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each letter covers eight verses for a total of one hundred and seventy-six verses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our singing a psalm is called psalming.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to learn to psalm a psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many saints have composed poetical pieces, but we must remember that in composing a psalm, hymn, or spiritual song we are not trying to say something strange or funny.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must compose poetry full of dignity and full of weight that takes care of the rhythm and rhyme.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Poetry without the proper rhyme is unacceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I composed over two hundred hymns in our hymnal, but since 1964 I have written hardly any hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I hope that some of the saints would be raised up and burdened by the Lord to continue to write hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since 1964 we have received much new light from the Word, and there are many new points that need some hymns to express them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our meetings, we must have some psalms, not only for psalming but also for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that in every meeting at least one-fourth of the speaking would be speaking on psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A hymn, like the cream of milk, is the cream of a certain composition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The best way for us to learn how to speak is to learn how to speak with the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should learn to use a hymn like O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine Hymns, #501 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That hymn will help us in speaking, but we have to learn to speak in a living way, in a very refreshing way, and in a very inspiring way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not just read the hymns, but speak in a Way to stir up the saints and inspire every attendant of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to practice speaking the hymns in this way again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we will be equipped to render much help to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can have a very good Lord s table meeting just by speaking one hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After speaking this hymn, we can sing it, and after singing it, we can speak it again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We would not need to call another hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By singing, speaking, singing, and speaking one hymn, the riches of Christ will be released into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>O Glorious Christ, Savior Mine has seven verses with many rich and high points.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How could we express something of these points by our instant speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That hymn was written with much consideration in the spirit, and it was improved and recomposed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I wrote this hymn in 1961 in Taipei, and many can testify that it is really hard to make any improvement to the Chinese version.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The expressions have been refined to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we could get ourselves into these expressions and learn to speak them, that would be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How good it would be if we could speak with the language of such a hymn in the meeting rather than speaking our own word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have rarely seen a meeting with good speaking on certain hymns because we have not spent the time to teach and train the saints in this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the saints in the churches have to learn to speak with the hymns and on the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am planning to study this matter when I return to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope to find out all the secrets concerning the speaking of hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we will present what we have found to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The New Testament through the Apostle Paul tells us twice that we need to speak the hymns to each other Eph 5:19; Col 3:16 .</S>
