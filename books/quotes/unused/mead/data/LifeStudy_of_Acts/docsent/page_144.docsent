   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see that in the synagogue Paul reasoned with the Jews and with those who worshipped, who probably were Greeks who worshipped God.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Epicurean philosophers were the followers of the Greek philosopher Epicurus 341-270 B.C. , whose philosophy was materialism, not recognizing the Creator and His providence over the world, but seeking sensuous pleasures, especially in eating and drinking.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Stoic philosophers were members of a school of philosophy founded by Zeno 340-265 B.C. . They were pantheists who believed that everything was governed by fate and that all happenings were the result of the divine will.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They said this because he was bringing good news of Jesus and the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul s kind of preaching was a strong indication that he was constituted of Jesus and of His resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was a person saturated with the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, he preached Jesus and the resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We intend to know therefore what these things mean.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time for nothing other than telling or hearing something new.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Areopagus was Mars Hill, the seat of the ancient and venerable Athenian court, which judged the most solemn problems of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That Paul was led to the Areopagus indicates that his preaching was very prevailing and that it stirred up the city, becoming the latest news.</S>
