   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. ITS SUPPLY BEING THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The supply of the holy city is the processed and consummated Triune God Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our God is not a "raw" God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some teach a God who is raw, "uncooked," that is, not processed and not consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the very God we preach and teach is the One who, according to the divine revelation, has been processed and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the processed and consummated God who can be our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Triune God passed through incarnation, human living, and an all-inclusive and all-problems-solving death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then He entered into an all-surpassing resurrection for the dispensing of life and an all-transcending ascension to execute through His heavenly ministry what He accomplished in His earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even God the Father has been processed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In whatever the Son passed through, the Father was with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Son told us He was never alone but that the Father who sent Him was always with Him John 8:29; 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the revelation concerning the Triune God given by the Lord to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No other Christians teach and preach the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was only within the last forty years that we began to use the terms processed and consummated to describe the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If Christ had not been processed, how could He have become a man to die on the cross to take away all our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If Christ had not been processed through resurrection, how could He have become the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the process of incarnation God became a man, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jesus was a genuine man, but through His death and in His resurrection, another two steps of His process, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God had not become a man to take away sin, how could He be our Redeemer?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If He had not become the life-giving Spirit, how could He have entered into us to be our life and our life supply?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The supply of the city is the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A. Signified by the River of Water of Life the Spirit and the Throne of God the Father and of the Lamb the Son</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Third of the Divine Trinity is signified by a river.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit, so the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Triune God has been consummated into one life-giving Spirit, and this Spirit is the flow signified by the river of water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The supply of the city is the Father as the source, the Spirit as the flow, and Christ as the content, typified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. Proceeding Out of the Throne of God the Administration of the Divine Authority</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This river proceeds out of the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This source is the divine administration and the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. Based on the Nature of God, Signified by Gold as the Base of God's Throne</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have seen that everything we are and do in our move and work for God needs to be based upon the golden nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even the flow of the Divine Trinity is based on the golden nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The river is flowing in the street, and the street is the base.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. In the Middle of Its Street in Its Fellowship Signified by the Street from the Throne to the Twelve Gates</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The river of water of life flows in the middle of the street, and the street signifies the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The one tree of life growing on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine that spreads and proceeds along the flow of the water of life for God's people to receive and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The tree of life is not a pine tree shooting up into the sky but a vine tree creeping on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This vine, the tree of life, grows within the middle of the street and along it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, in the middle of the fellowship is the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The street begins from the mountaintop, God, to reach all the twelve gates of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the middle of this street is the river of water of life to flow out the riches of God to be our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This street with the river is a two-way traffic, coming and going, proceeding down and spiraling up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This coming and going is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All who enter into the city through the pearl gates participate in the same fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This fellowship begins from God as the source to reach all the twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That means it reaches all the ones who have entered into the city to bring them back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>E. Its Main Element for the Life Supply to Nourish the Entire City Being the Tree of Life Signifying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Its main element for the life supply to nourish the entire city is the tree of life, signifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the beginning of the Bible in the second chapter of Genesis, the tree of life is seen as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because of man's fall the way to touch that tree was closed by God's glory, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later, Christ's death on the cross fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness to reopen the closed way to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is our way to enter into the city, so He is signified by the pearl gates, which include the reality of His death and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>F. In the Spirit, Signified by the River of Water of Life as the Beverage Supply to Quench the Thirst of the Holy City</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Human beings need food as the supply to nourish them, but without water they cannot survive.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need water as our beverage to match the food that we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All these things are signified in this great sign.</S>
