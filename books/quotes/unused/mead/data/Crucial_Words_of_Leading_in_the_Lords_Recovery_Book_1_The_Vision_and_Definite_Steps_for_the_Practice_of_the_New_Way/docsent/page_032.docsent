   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Result of Adopting</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Custom of the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord highly regarded and blessed our early practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fewer than six years, the number of saints in Taiwan increased from 400 to 40,000.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was a hundredfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Islam had a fivefold increase in fifty years, but we had a hundredfold increase in fewer than six years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was truly the Lord s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I went to America in 1961, there were 22,000 information cards of the saints in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this rate of increase had continued until today, Taiwan would have been gospelized twice already.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, instead of practicing this way faithfully, we went backward to adopt the custom of the nations, and we took the old way of Christianity; hence, we ended up in the awkward situation we are in today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am not forcing you all to follow me to change the system, but I would like to reason with you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I do not present both sides of this matter, it will be difficult for us to change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today I am crying out, Do we want to live in religion?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not want to live in religion, we need to indicate it plainly and not stay in a neutral position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To put it bluntly, it seems as if I have been a mean person for one and a half years, rebuking and making demands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if we understand the history of the Lord s recovery, we will realize that when we first arrived in Taiwan the atmosphere and practice among us were not like what we see today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The saints at that time were all burning in spirit, functioning, and spreading the gospel in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the reason that our numbers increased from 400 to 40,000.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many of us here were saved at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among the ones saved in those days, quite a number later became elders in different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When people in the denominations saw this situation, they started a rumor out of jealousy, saying, They simply drag people in and hastily baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I replied that if this were the case, they should try to drag in forty thousand people and baptize them in a period of six years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sadly, these good circumstances did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We turned unknowingly from being living fish to dead wood that simply drifts in a slow stream.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, we drifted into Christianity and became the same as Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We completely lost the family tradition we had brought to Taiwan in the beginning and turned instead to take the custom of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This causes my heart to ache.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope we all can see that the religious way of Christianity buries the new ones and kills their organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As for us, over the past twenty years, beginning from 1962, we have been gradually going downhill.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even though the slope may not be steep, if we are off by a fraction of an inch we may end up missing the mark by a thousand miles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we are already seeing the consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE DIFFICULTY IN CHANGING THE SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It has been a year and a half since I came back to push our changing the system, but not many of us have been moved yet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apparently, we have a number of activities, but actually, the new way does not depend on how many activities we have but on whether or not we have cleared away everything that is old and picked up what is new.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were active for more than twenty years, going to meetings not only once a week but three or four times a week.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet in the end we went downhill.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank the Lord that in this year and a half we have all agreed and are willing to change the system.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In terms of action, however, only a few of us have discarded the old things and have made a turn to practice the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>EXAMINING OUR CHANGING OF THE SYSTEM Keeping the Big Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps it seems that I am speaking too much and that I am demanding perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let us speak about some specific practices as a way of examining the change of system.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, we have clearly said that no matter how much we change the system, we still should keep the big meeting on the Lord s Day morning to take care of those who like only to listen to messages and do not want to attend small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus kept the same principle while He was ministering on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every Sabbath He went into the synagogue and preached there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did not go there to keep the Sabbath, nor did He have the intention to worship God there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, He took advantage of the custom in those days to preach the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only did the Lord Jesus do this, the apostles also did this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Paul preached the gospel in the Gentile lands, wherever he went, the first place he visited was the synagogue; moreover, it was always on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the apostles were asked to return on the following Sabbath, they would go again Acts 13:42-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Surely Paul did not go to keep the Sabbath, but he utilized the custom practiced by the Jews who were scattered among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, when the Jews were gathered in the synagogues to study the Scriptures on the Sabbath, Paul went to preach to them the New Testament gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today nearly everywhere in the world people have a day off on the Lord s Day; they do not go to work, nor do they go to school.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Most people have the concept that Christians should attend Sunday service every Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Among us there is also a group of saints who are used to this custom; for this reason, we must take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to use this opportunity and take the time to give them a message.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should help them to have a gradual turn and should never give up on them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, based on my observation, we have not done enough in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In some meeting halls this matter has not been done properly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result, the Lord s Day morning meeting looks like a big meeting, and it also looks like a class that teaches truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whatever we do will be ineffective if it is not done appropriately.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we must do something, we should do it properly and seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since we have a Lord s Day morning meeting, even if only ten people come, we must be serious and speak a message to them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we began changing the system one and a half years ago, we set the basic principle of transferring all the co-workers out of the various meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Based upon the revelation in the New Testament, we left the church under the management of the elders of the respective meetings halls, not under the management of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The management of the church by the co-workers is not a principle revealed in the Bible; it is a traditional practice in religion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, in order to have a strong speaking of the messages in the Lord s Day morning meeting, there is a need for a few co-workers who are gifted to go to the various meeting halls to help the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But I am concerned that if the co-workers go back to the meeting halls, they will again be involved with the administration of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The elders in a certain meeting hall may also feel that it is good for the co-workers to help in the administration of their meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Consequently, we may go back to the situation we were in before we began to change the system.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nevertheless, our present arrangement of preparing a message, in order to take care of the saints who come to the big Lord s Day morning meeting, is very considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must carry this out according to what has been fellowshipped so that we can avoid creating problems.</S>
