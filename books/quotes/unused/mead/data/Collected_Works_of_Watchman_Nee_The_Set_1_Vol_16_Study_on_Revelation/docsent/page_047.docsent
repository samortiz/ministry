   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Revelation 13:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And that no one may be able to buy or sell except he who has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not hard not to sell, but it is really hard not to buy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are several kinds of marks: one is the name of the beast; one is the number of his name; and others may be various kinds of symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>G. Revelation 13:18</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Here is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This beast is not the beast that comes up out of the earth but the beast that comes up out of the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people only search into the number 666, but they forget to pay attention to the context of the whole verse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to this verse, there are three things which must agree:</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1 The number of a man the number of a place cannot be used .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2 The number of the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 13:1 the beast has seven heads, and 17:9 and 10 say that these seven heads are the seven mountains and also the seven kings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>History clearly tells us that Rome is a city of seven mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then does this beast refer to the Roman Empire or to one of the Roman emperors?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since 13:18 says that the number of the beast is the number of a man, this beast must not refer to the Roman Empire but rather to one of the Roman emperors!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3 It must be the number of a person's name, a person who is a Roman emperor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sum of these numbers is 666.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From these three facts we can find out who the beast is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The letters of the Greek and Hebrew alphabets all represent numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Except for Caesar Nero, there is no other man in history who has this number.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nero's number is 306, to which 360 must be added to make it correct.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The title of Caesar exactly represents the number 360.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the Bible mentions the names of the Roman emperors, the title Caesar is always added, as in Luke 2:1 and 3:1, which mention Caesar Augustus and Tiberius Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>History tells us that Nero always called himself Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the Hebrew alphabet, the sum of the numbers of the name Caesar Nero is exactly 666.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people think that the former Nero committed suicide and that the future false Christ will be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So how can we say that this is Nero?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Revelation 17:11, we know that this false Christ is the resuscitated Nero.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, there is no conflict at all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The following shows the sums of these numbers:</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nero</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Caesar</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Greek</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hebrew</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Greek</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrew</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>N</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>50</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>K</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>100</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>200</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>60</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>6</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>200</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>50</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>306</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>360</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>666</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From this we see that the first beast, which comes up out of the sea, is Antichrist, the resuscitated Caesar Nero; while the beast that comes up out of the earth is the false prophet, the resurrected Judas, the betrayer of Jesus.</S>
