<h1 class="title">KEEPING OURSELVES IN<br />
THE ONE FLOW OF THE LORD&rsquo;S WORK<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE UNIVERSAL BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Ezek. 47:1-12; Eph. 2:21-22; 3:17a; Phil. 2:13; Matt. 7:21-24; Rev. 21:2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The book of Acts reveals that in the move of the Lord there is only one divine stream of the Lord&rsquo;s work and that we need to keep ourselves in this stream:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine stream, which has been flowing throughout the generations, is uniquely one; since there is only one divine stream and since the flow is uniquely one, we need to keep ourselves in this one flow&mdash;1 John 1:3; Rev. 22:1.</li>
	<li>When we give the Lord the preeminence in our entire being, making Him our first love, He becomes the divine stream to us, flowing within us and out of us as the first works; the first works are works that are motivated by, issue from, and express the Lord as our first love; only works that are motivated by the first love are gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;v. 1; 2:4-5; 1 Cor. 2:9; 3:12.</li>
	<li>The flowing of the divine life, which started on the day of Pentecost and has been flowing throughout all generations to this day, is just one stream for God&rsquo;s goal to build up the church for His corporate expression&mdash;Matt. 16:18; cf. Ezek. 47:1-12.</li>
	<li>We must be faithful to the flowing of this stream of the divine life, of the fellowship of the Body, of the testimony of the Lord Jesus, and of the work of God&mdash;Gen. 2:10-14; Psa. 36:8-9; 46:4a; John 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the recovery there is a definite work that is for the building up of the local churches unto the building up of the universal Body of Christ&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 16:10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All the co-workers should do the same one work universally for the unique Body; the starting point of the work is the oneness of the Body&mdash;3:12; 15:58; 16:10; Eph. 4:4, 11-16.</li>
	<li>Our work is the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the building of the Body of Christ&mdash;vv. 4, 16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Body is the governing law of the life and work of the children of God today&mdash;1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:4-6, 12-13, 27.</li>
		<li>The work of the Triune God in us is to produce the Body of Christ, the reality of which is the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ&mdash;Eph. 3:16-21; 4:4-6, 12, 16.</li>
		<li>The work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the work of His economy, the work of the Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 15:58; 16:10; Col. 4:11.</li>
		<li>According to Song of Songs 7:11, Christ&rsquo;s lover wants to carry out with her Beloved the work that is for the entire world (fields) by sojourning from one place to another (lodging in the villages); this is to keep one work in one Body&mdash;Eph. 4:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
<li>We have to see what God&rsquo;s work is, and we have to know what is God&rsquo;s central work in man&mdash;3:17a; Phil. 2:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The main work of God today is to work Himself into man; only when God is worked into man can God&rsquo;s eternal purpose be fulfilled&mdash;Gal. 4:19; Eph. 3:17a; 4:16.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s main goal is not the works but to gain persons through the works; if God does not gain a person, He will have no work, and He will have no way&mdash;Acts 9:15; 13:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have to remember all the time that the need today is for God to work Himself into us rather than for us to work for God&mdash;Eph. 2:10; Phil. 2:13.</li>
		<li>It is not that we work for the Lord but that He works on us; we must not be merely His workers but His work&mdash;Eph. 2:10.</li>
		<li>The kind of person we are determines the kind of fruit we produce; if our person is wrong, we may build up something by what we do but tear down more by what we are&mdash;Matt. 7:17-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
<li>According to the entire revelation of the New Testament, the unique goal of the Christian work should be the New Jerusalem, which is the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;1 Cor. 3:10; Heb. 12:22; Rev. 21:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The co-workers must see that we should do only one work, which is to make God&rsquo;s chosen people regenerated ones, sanctified ones, renewed ones&mdash;the new man&mdash;transformed ones, conformed ones&mdash;those conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God&mdash;and glorified ones; all those who will be in the New Jerusalem are this kind of people&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 4:12.</li>
	<li>In this way, we go up level by level until we reach the highest point, where we become the same; there is no more flesh, no more natural being; all are in the Spirit; all are the kingdom of the heavens, and all are beings of the New Jerusalem&mdash;this is the highest point&mdash;Rev. 4:3; 21:19-21; Gal. 5:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
