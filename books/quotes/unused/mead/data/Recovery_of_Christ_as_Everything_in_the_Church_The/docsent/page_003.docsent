   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MANY THINGS CREEPING IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO REPLACE CHRIST IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the latter part of the first century, while the apostles were still on the earth, two main things crept into the church to replace Christ Judaism and Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians was written to deal with Judaism, and Colossians was written to deal with Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since the first century, many other things have crept into the church to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, different doctrines came in to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many doctrines, including scriptural doctrines, have replaced Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, various practices, such as foot-washing, leg-lengthening, and different forms of baptism, have come in to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many Pentecostals may care for speaking in tongues rather than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, speaking in tongues has also replaced Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The subtlest thing that has crept in among Christians is opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are endless opinions about what musical instruments to use in meetings and many other such things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Besides doctrines, practices, and opinions, there are various kinds of activities and movements that have also come in to replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Another item that has replaced Christ is organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every denomination is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some denominations are organized according to certain practices or doctrines; others are organized according to a nation, such as the Church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These organizations replace Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even Judaism and philosophy are still replacing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The robes of the Catholic clergy were designed according to the Old Testament priests robes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates a mixture with Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those in so-called modern Christianity believe in their philosophy rather than the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Philosophy has replaced Christ among these groups.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Judaism, philosophy, doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, and organizations have altogether replaced Christ among countless believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE LORD S RECOVERY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TO RECOVER CHRIST AS EVERYTHING TO US</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because many things have replaced Christ, the Lord s recovery is to recover Christ in a full way, to recover Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Lord s recovery we should not care for doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, or organizations but only for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, our way to preach the gospel should be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 15:5 the Lord said, I am the vine; you are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The proper way for the branches to bear fruit is simply to live the vine, to grow the vine, and to produce the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no need for gimmicks or worldly activities to contact people for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord also said, I am the way 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way to preach the gospel is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As branches in the vine, we need only to love the Lord, live Him, grow Him, and produce Him in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do, we will be a living testimony to our relatives, neighbors, colleagues, and classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When one of them becomes sick, loses his job, or experiences some other difficult situation, he may remember us and ask us to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After we speak only a few words of the gospel, he may be willing to pray to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way we live the gospel by living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not need movements, activities, or gimmicks to try to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The proper way to preach the gospel is by living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the original way that needs to be recovered today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Acts 1:8 the Lord charges us to be His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our commission is not merely to preach but to be witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to be witnesses of Christ by daily living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be a witness by living Christ is to take Christ as the way to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We will see a wonderful result if we are a living testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our relatives and acquaintances may outwardly criticize and even despise us, but their conscience will inwardly testify on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the time comes according to the Lord s arrangement, one by one they will gradually turn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is everything in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not care for doctrines, practices, opinions, activities, movements, or organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We care for Christ and Christ alone.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is our life, our reality, and our way in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the Lord s recovery.</S>
