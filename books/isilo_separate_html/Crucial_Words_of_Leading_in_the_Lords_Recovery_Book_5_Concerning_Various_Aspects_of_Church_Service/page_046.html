THE LORD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>Chapter 19 is another example. Verses 1 through 10 speak of the salvation of a tax collector named Zaccheus. In verse 9 the Lord joyfully said, &ldquo;Today salvation has come to this house.&rdquo; Then He said, &ldquo;The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost&rdquo; (v. 10). Immediately after that the Lord spoke another parable (vv. 11-27). He compared Himself to a man of noble birth who was going to a distant country to receive a kingdom and return. This means that He would leave the world, ascend to receive His kingdom, and return. This man called ten of his slaves. Ten is the number of completion and represents all the saved believers. The ten slaves included Zaccheus and even you and me. Each slave was given one mina, which signifies the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. A mina is a silver coin, and in the Bible silver signifies the redemption of Christ. The one mina signifies the redemption of Christ that we receive and the salvation of Christ that we enjoy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE WHO RECEIVES SALVATION<br />
DOING BUSINESS</h2>
<p>This parable in the Gospel of Luke is different from that in Matthew 25. The parable in the Gospel of Matthew speaks of one slave receiving five talents, another receiving two talents, and another receiving one talent (v. 15). The talents refer to spiritual gifts. The parable in Luke emphasizes the common salvation given equally to each believer. Paul received one mina, and we each received one mina. We need to use the one mina to do business. The Lord commanded us to make a profit. After we are saved, we need to use this mina to earn ten minas. As soon as we are saved, we need to save ten people. We at least need to save five.</p>
<p>In Luke 19 the Lord did not ask us to use one mina to earn another mina or to earn half a mina. He asked us to use one mina to earn at least five minas (vv. 16, 18). After we earn ten minas, the Lord says, &ldquo;Well done, good slave. Because you have become faithful in the least, have authority over ten cities&rdquo; (v. 17). This means that when the Lord returns, we will be co-kings with Him. Each of us has one mina in our hand. Whether we will be able to rule over ten cities in the future does not depend on fate; rather, it depends on whether we do business.</p>
<p>The person who kept the mina in a handkerchief said to the Lord, &ldquo;Master, behold your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief; for I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man: you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow&rdquo; (vv. 20-21). This slave represents many Christians who do not preach the gospel. It is not that they do not love the Lord but that they fear the Lord more than they love Him. Therefore, they keep the Lord&rsquo;s salvation carefully and wrap it in a handkerchief for fear that they will be penalized because they lost it. To them the Lord Jesus is unreasonable and very harsh. This is why they say, &ldquo;You withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow&rdquo; (v. 21).</p>
<p>Do we love the Lord or fear Him? If we truly love the Lord, we would seize the opportunity and utilize our one mina to earn ten minas. If every brother and every sister would lead ten people to salvation, and these ten would each bring in another ten, there would be one hundred newly saved believers. Then each of the one hundred would gain another ten, resulting in one thousand. In this way all the people in Taiwan would be saved in ten years. Whether we reach this goal depends on whether we are willing to carry it out. The only question lies in whether we love the Lord more or fear the Lord more. Sometimes we reluctantly preach the gospel, but inwardly we still feel that the Lord is harsh. Those slaves who do not do business always feel that the master is harsh and that the master wants to withdraw where he did not deposit and reap where he did not sow. They feel that the master is unreasonable and that they are being forced. Actually this corresponds to compelling people in Luke 14.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE STAGES OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The First Stage of Preaching the Gospel&mdash; Targeting the Jews</h2>
<p>Luke 14 speaks of a man who prepared a great dinner. After everything was ready, he invited many to come (vv. 16-17). This represents the gospel. The Lord Jesus was crucified, which means that the fatted calf was slaughtered, and a feast was prepared. Then God sent His slave to invite people to the feast. This refers to three stages of preaching the gospel. In the first stage, those who were invited all made excuses. The first said that he had bought a piece of land and needed to go out and see it (v. 18). The second said that he had bought five yoke of oxen, and he needed to prove them (v. 19). The third said that he had married a wife and therefore could not come (v. 20). The ones who had money, land, oxen, and wives refer to the Jews. Today the Jews in the world refuse the Lord Jesus. God is not pleased when people do not believe in Jesus (v. 21). It is a great insult to God that people do not believe in His Son. As a result of the Jews rejecting the Lord, in A.D. 70 the Roman army destroyed Jerusalem and did not leave even one stone upon another. That was a very cruel event in the history of Israel.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> </body></html>
