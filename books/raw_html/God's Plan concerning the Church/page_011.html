        <h2 class="head2">The Shining of the Church Heading Up All Things</h2>
<p>God will gather all things into one through the shining of the church because the shining of the church will bring all things under one Head, Christ, who was appointed in eternity and exalted at His ascension by God (1 Tim. 1:17; Acts 5:31). Revelation 21:24 concerns the relationship between the nations on the earth and the New Jerusalem: &ldquo;The nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it.&rdquo; When the light of the New Jerusalem shines forth, the nations will walk by the light of the city and bring their glory into the city. The light of the city gathers the nations and all things unto Christ the Head. God will head up all things by her shining.</p>
<p>The coming New Jerusalem will have not only the flow of God&rsquo;s life as her content and the shining of God&rsquo;s light as her outward expression but also the ruling of the throne of God and Christ as her center. Her outward shining of light is based on her inward flow of life, and her inward flow of life is from the ruling of the throne at her center. Her outward light is joined to the throne at her center; her outward shining depends upon the ruling at her center. Therefore, all that she shines on will be brought under the ruling of the throne at her center. In other words, all that are in her light will be under the throne. Her light will bring people under the throne, and her shining will subject people to an inward ruling. Therefore, for the nations to walk by her light means that all things are subject to the throne of God and Christ, that all things acknowledge the authority of God and Christ, and that all things are under Christ as the God-appointed Head, who is heading up the church.</p>
<p>Today the world cannot be one, because the world does not acknowledge the headship of Christ. All things are not in harmony, because they lack the ruling of Christ. Only when God brings the world and all things under the ruling of Christ and the headship of Christ through the shining of the church can the world be one, and all things be in harmony and one accord. There is one accord only when there is the headship of Christ. Only by being subject to Christ the Head can everything be gathered into one under His Headship. When God brings all things under the authority of Christ through the light shining forth from the church, all things will be gathered into one under Christ the Head.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Subjecting All Things under the Head, Christ,<br />
through the Church and to the Church</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:10 is complemented by verse 22. These two verses speak concerning two sides of one thing. Verse 10 implies that God heads up all things in Christ through the church. Verse 22 says that God gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. According to verse 10, God&rsquo;s heading up of all things in Christ as the unique Head is through the church. According to verse 22, God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under Christ&rsquo;s feet and giving Him to be Head over all things is to the church. In verse 10 Christ can head up all things through the church. Without the church, Christ cannot head up all things. In verse 22 Christ is the Head over all things to the church. Therefore, these two verses show that God subjected all things under Christ&rsquo;s authority and gave Him to be Head over all things not only through the church but also to the church. The church is both the means and the aim of God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under the Head, Christ.</p>
<p>God is subjecting all things under the Head, Christ, not only through the church but also to the church, because the church is not only God&rsquo;s vessel but also the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (v. 23). If the subjecting of all things is only through the church but not to the church, the church would merely be a vessel for God&rsquo;s use, just as a light bulb is a vessel for the passing through of electrical current. The Bible says that we are God&rsquo;s vessels (Rom. 9:23-24), but it also says that we are the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). We are not only vessels; we are also the Body functioning as vessels. The way we treat our physical body is different from the way we treat a vessel. We do not need to care for a vessel&rsquo;s feeling or enjoyment; we can put a vessel anywhere. However, we need to care for the feelings and enjoyment of our physical body and consider the environment in which we live.</p>
<p>Because the church is not only God&rsquo;s vessel but also the Body of Christ, God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under the Head, Christ, is not only through the church but also to the church. In the subjecting of all things, the church has not only a function but also an enjoyment. When the Head rules over all things, the Body rules together with Him. When all things are subjected under the authority of the Head, all things are subjected under the authority of the Body. The Head&rsquo;s heading up of all things is to the Body. God&rsquo;s subjecting all things under the feet of the Head is also to the Body. The Body enjoys and possesses the authority with the Head. When the Head is enthroned, the Body is also enthroned. When the Head rules, the Body also rules. The subjecting of all things is not only through the church but also to the church.</p>
<p>Hence, the Body and the Head are a matter of matching. In order for the Body to rule with the Head, the Body must match the Head. Therefore, we must soberly ask ourselves, &ldquo;Do our situations and conditions match Christ? Are we ruling together with Christ? Are we royal? Do our conduct and activities match Christ the King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:19 through 22 says that God caused the surpassing greatness of His power to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead, in seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, and in subjecting all things under His feet to make Him Head over all things. However, Hebrews 2:8 says that &ldquo;we do not yet see all things subjected to Him.&rdquo; Why does this verse say that all things are not yet subject to Him? The answer is in verse 10, which says, &ldquo;In leading many sons into glory.&rdquo; All things are not yet subject to Him, because we have not yet entered into glory. According to Romans 8, the whole creation is still groaning and travailing in pain and is not yet subject to the headship of Christ, because the children of God have not yet entered into the freedom of the glory of God (vv. 21-22). In other words, the bride in Revelation 21:2 is not yet prepared or adorned. The bride is the holy city, New Jerusalem, the Body of Christ. When she is ready, that is, when she is clothed in fine linen, bright and clean (19:7-8), God&rsquo;s sons will be brought into glory, and all things will be subjected under Christ&rsquo;s feet. By then all things will be under Christ the Head through us and to us. He will shine forth through us, and we will reign together with Him.</p>
<p>The condition of the church does not yet match the glory of God. Therefore, we do not yet see all things subjected under the authority of Christ. We must let Christ&rsquo;s life work in us daily until we let Christ rule in us. Then all things will be subjected under the authority of Christ, which is to be subjected also under the authority of the church. In the Old Testament Joseph and Daniel let God reign in them. As a result, the Gentiles were subjected under God&rsquo;s authority, which was also to be subjected under the authority of Joseph and Daniel. They brought the Gentiles under God&rsquo;s ruling, and they ruled with God and enjoyed the glory of that ruling (Gen. 41:39-44; Dan. 2:46-48). God was on the throne, and they too were on the throne. God ruled in Babylon through Daniel and to Daniel, and God ruled in Egypt through Joseph and to Joseph. When we let Christ&rsquo;s glorious, royal life live out of us and let God&rsquo;s light shine forth from us, God will gather people to Himself through us and to us. For example, when the elderly Jacob was set before Pharaoh in Egypt, God did things through him and to him. Jacob could stretch out his hand and bless Pharaoh (Gen. 47:7). We may say that Egypt was not only under his hand but also under his feet.</p>
<p>God is the glory of the church and the enjoyment of the church. One day we will see all things under Christ the Head through the church and under the church because of the Head. This will be a glorious day. In principle, we can be saved today to the extent that all things are through us and to us. The key is that we must enter into glory. We do not yet see all things subjected under the feet of the Head, because we, as sons, have not yet entered into glory. When the church is in glory, there will be nothing that is not under the Head and nothing that is not under the church. In order for the church to enter into glory, she must fully let God live forth and let His glory be expressed. When the church fully expresses God&rsquo;s glory, everything will be subject under the feet of the Head and under the church. The church is the Body of the Head, and the Head is Head over all things for His Body and to His Body. This is the ultimate purpose that God wants to achieve and the ultimate standing that the church must obtain. This is great, high, and glorious. For this we bow our heads and worship Him!</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
