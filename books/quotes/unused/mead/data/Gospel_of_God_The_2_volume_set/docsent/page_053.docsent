   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We owe God "ten thousand talents of silver," but we have no way to repay.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now God is doing the same thing for us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because He loves us, He cannot ask us to pay Him back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But because He is righteous, He will not tell us that we have no need to repay at all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For us to pay Him back is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet for God to release us from our obligation is unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank and praise Him that He has come to give us the "money," that we can pay back what we owe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The collector is God, and the payer is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without collecting, there is no righteousness; but if we are made to pay, there is no love.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now God Himself is the collector; hence, righteousness is maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And God Himself is also the payer; hence, love is maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The collector is the payer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the biblical meaning of redemption from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Jesus the Nazarene came and bore our sins in His body onto the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God Himself came to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our sins were judged by God in the person of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The blood of the Lord Jesus shed on the cross is proof of this judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We come to God by this blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through the Lord Jesus we tell God that we have been judged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we are turning over to Him what the Lord Jesus has paid for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is true that we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we are not irresponsible; there has been the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is true that we had a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we are not avoiding it; the debt has already been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have the blood, which signifies the accomplished salvation of the Lord Jesus, as the receipt proving that God has paid our debt back to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why the blood in the Old Testament was sprinkled seven times within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why it had to be brought to the propitiation cover on the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has to forgive every sinner who comes to Him through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no way for Him not to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us return to the previous illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose I borrowed ten thousand talents of silver from a brother and I have no money to pay him back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day he comes to my home and says, "You owe me ten thousand talents of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now you must pay me back.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am not an irresponsible or loose person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whatever I do, I do seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have to pay me back.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now here are ten thousand talents of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Bring this to my house tomorrow and pay back your debt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then you can take back your promissory note."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I would expect that when I go to his house with the money the next day I will be able to redeem the promissory note.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But suppose that after I hand him the money, he says that because the money was given to me by him the day before, he will not return the promissory note to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Can he do such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I hand him the money, does he have the right not to hand me back the promissory note?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No. He had the right not to give me the money the day before.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If he did not give me the money the day before, at most I can say that he does not love me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I cannot say a word more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if he has given me the money and I pay him back, he is unrighteous if he still keeps my note; it is not simply a matter of him not loving me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If he is righteous, he has to hand me the note when I hand him the money.</S>
