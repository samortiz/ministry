   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>At the end of the New Testament the Great Babylon will be destroyed Rev 18:2 , and on the other hand the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This New Jerusalem is also called the "tabernacle of God," or the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus at the end we still see the tent, the symbol of the overcomers, as an opposing testimony against the city, which represents the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These biblical records convey the spiritual meaning of the tent in opposition to the city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The city is the symbol and center of all human, self-devised life, and thus represents the world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The tent, erected in the wilderness, that is, outside the world, represents the pilgrim life outside of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who live in the tent signify that they are not submerged in the world; rather, they lead a sojourner's life outside the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When man failed and lost God, he succumbed to the world; when man was saved by God, he subsequently left the world and lived in a tent as a stranger and sojourner, serving only God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible discloses that the altar always accompanies the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If there is a tent, there is an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is no tent, there is no altar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After his departure from the ark, Noah erected a tent and built an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Abraham went to Canaan, he also erected a tent and built an altar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But during his sojourn in Egypt, he lost the tent, and consequently the altar was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Likewise, the Israelites during their slavery in Egypt had no altar, but when they left Egypt and came into the wilderness, they lived in the tent and re-established the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When there is the altar, then consecration, service, and worship follow, because the altar is the place for man to consecrate himself and the means to serve and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These were the natural outcome of man's life in the tent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever man succumbed to the world, he lost his consecration, service, and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tent life is the position, not only where man serves God, but also where God meets him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This principle is evident in the lives of Abraham and Lot.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God appeared to Abraham while he sat in the tent door.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This bears witness to his victorious position over the world, which enabled him to obtain God's manifestation Gen 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, God Himself did not appear unto Lot Gen 19 ; instead, two angels were sent to Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They found Lot sitting at the gate, which proves that he had already succumbed to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the angels came to his rescue, God Himself did not appear to him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He cannot appear to those whom the world has claimed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once man falls into the world, he is gained by Satan and can no longer see light in the face of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the world possesses God's children and destroys God's purpose, God saves man in two aspects: from sin and from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Salvation from sin delivers us only from our fallen state, whereas salvation from the world delivers us from our fallen position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we preach the gospel, we give much attention to deliverance from sin, but we seldom speak about deliverance from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Old Testament, the salvation of God is seen in two important types: the ark of Noah and the exodus from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Each type shows both aspects of deliverance from sin and from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The eight members of Noah's family were saved by the ark and by the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ark delivered them from God's judgment of the flood; the water delivered them from the corrupt world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Similarly, Israel was saved by the Passover and by the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Passover denotes their deliverance from God's judgment of death; the Red Sea denotes their deliverance from the ruling power of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, the perfect salvation we enjoy today also has two aspects faith and baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through faith we are delivered from sin by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Through baptism we are delivered from the world by water.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Noah's family was saved through the flood which destroyed the world and thus was delivered from the corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Israelites were saved through the water of the Red Sea which drowned the Egyptian army, and they were thus delivered from the Egyptian world which ruled over them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Baptism is foreshadowed by these two incidents of passing through the waters of death 1 Pet 3:20-21; 1 Cor 10:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Baptism by immersion delivers us from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, when a believer is baptized, he has passed through both the flood and the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His ascent from the water denotes his separation from the world and his new position relative to the life of the tent and the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We who have been chosen and saved should continually live a tent life as a testimony that we have been delivered and separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this manner we shall be delivered from being possessed by the world and be a people living completely unto God by the way of the altar.</S>
