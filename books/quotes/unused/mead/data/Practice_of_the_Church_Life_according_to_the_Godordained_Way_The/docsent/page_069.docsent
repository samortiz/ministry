   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Practicing the Group Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the practice of group meetings, many principles have been set forth in previous messages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You need to apply these principles and group together the dear ones who are under your care.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In your group meetings you should not have any kind of religious service or form of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, you should not conduct yourself as if you are going to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these ways you must drop.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just come together with your group in a natural way to have a mutual fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Practicing to Prophesy</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then, from the group meetings you should go on to prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The most difficult of the four steps of the God-ordained way is prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we all can learn to prophesy if we will have a definite beginning and also take the time to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some dissenting ones have proclaimed that 1 Corinthians 14 is not written to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They say that it is directed only to a certain class of believers who are considered prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a wrong teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 14:1 says, "Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first verse of 1 Corinthians 14 does not refer only to the so-called prophets; rather, it refers to all the saints, including us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then verses 23 and 24 say, "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and...all prophesy..."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These verses show that in the church meetings, all the believers can prophesy v. 31 . Therefore, we should not listen to the erroneous teaching of the dissenters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, we should receive the apostles' teaching in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I beg you to take my word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From now on you yourself must do something.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must begin by studying the first step of the God-ordained way: how to get people regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then, you must find the way to practice it with your companions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I do believe that you will see some results.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Especially the elders, those who take care of the churches, must themselves have a practical beginning with some companions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They should not promote this to the entire congregation; that way does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders themselves must take the lead to do it.</S>
