<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SERPENTINE PEOPLE BECOMING THE UNIVERSAL INCREASE OF THE UNLIMITED CHRIST BY THE IMMEASURABLE SPIRIT WITH THE ETERNAL LIFE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6, 8, 14-16, 29-30, 31-36</h1><p>In the previous messages we pointed out that the writings of John are concerned with the divine mysteries. These mysteries include the mystery of the divine Person, the mystery of the divine life, and the mystery of the divine birth. Actually anything that is divine is a mystery to the human mind.<h2 class=head1>NEGLECTING THE MYSTERIES AND FORMING A RELIGION</h2><p>If we neglect the mysteries in the writings of John, we may take what is revealed in the Bible and use it to form a religion. According to the Bible, Christians teach that there is a God and that this God is triune—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. They also teach that the human race has become fallen and sinful in the sight of God. According to God’s righteous law, we all should be judged and perish. Christians teach from the Bible that God loves fallen mankind, that He sent His Son into the world as a man, and that this One died on the cross for our sins. But since He is the Son of God, He could not be held by death. Therefore, He was resurrected, and He has ascended to the heavens, where as the Lord of all He is now sitting at the right hand of God. One day He will come back to set up His kingdom on earth and will reign on earth for a thousand years, a period of time known in Christian teaching as the millennium. Anyone who believes the gospel will receive the forgiveness of sins and will have eternal life. This kind of Bible teaching has been spread throughout the world.<p>Furthermore, Christians are taught to worship God, to do everything for the glory of God, and to bring souls to Christ. They are also taught to gather together to worship God according to certain rituals, forms or ordinances. In none of these teachings can we see the depths of the mysterious things.<p>Christians often talk about eternal life. However, eternal life is usually understood to signify some kind of everlasting blessing. To many Christians, the words “eternal life” do not convey the thought of a mysterious, divine life. It is common for Christians to speak of everlasting life rather than eternal life, according to the King James Version. In the concept of many, the term everlasting life denotes a blessing that lasts forever. Such teachings do not touch the mysteries in the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE LIFE AND THE DIVINE SPIRIT</h2><p>What is revealed in the depths of the Bible is mysterious, such as the divine life and the divine Spirit. Christians speak mainly of four matters related to Christ: Christ in eternity, Christ in the flesh dying to accomplish redemption, Christ in ascension at the right hand of God, and Christ in His coming back. But they miss the crucial matter of the indwelling Christ.<p>The indwelling of Christ involves two mysteries: the mystery of the divine life and the mystery of the divine Spirit. Life and the Spirit are two of the most mysterious matters revealed in the Bible. Today the resurrected Christ is both the divine life and the divine Spirit. Christ in resurrection is the divine life, the life that in the Bible is called eternal life. He is also the divine Spirit, whom the Bible calls the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Eternal life and the life-giving Spirit are very mysterious matters. No other mysteries in the Word can compare with these.
