<h1 class="series">CHRIST IS ALL SPIRITUAL<br />MATTERS AND THINGS</h1><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1><p>(The first three chapters of this book are the same as the first three chapters of the book Christ Is the Way, the Truth, and the Life published in this volume. Therefore, we have not included them in the following pages.)</p><h2 class="head1">IS IT CHRIST, OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?</h2><p>The following five chapters are messages given by the Lord's servant some time ago. Because of the present urgent need of all the saints everywhere for these kinds of messages, we have published them today.</p><p>According to God's desire, plan, and redemption, He has ordained that His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, be all spiritual matters and things. When a man touches Him, he touches the reality of all spiritual matters and things. After a man gains Him, he gains all spiritual matters and things that God has prepared for him. But man has replaced Him with many so-called spiritual things. Although these many things, in man's eyes, belong to Him, they are nevertheless not Him. Rather, they are a replacement of Him. Therefore, they do not render man real help in his spiritual life.</p><p>We are facing a serious problem! What are we pursuing? What do we know, and what have we gained in the spiritual realm? Is it Christ, or is it something else? If it is Christ, we are touching the reality that God has ordained for us. If it is something else, no matter how good and valuable, we are merely touching vain and unprofitable things!</p><p>Today Christ is in the Spirit. In order to touch Him, we must be in spirit. We can use our mind to touch the things which are apart from Him. But in order to touch Him, we have to use the spirit. In order to touch the things that are apart from Him, we only need human zeal and cleverness. But in order to touch Him, we need God's revelation. We have to look to Him for His mercy and grace!</p><p>Witness Lee</p>
