   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD CONFIRMING HIS PROMISE BY MAKING A COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM THROUGH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because Abraham found it difficult to believe in God regarding the promise of the land, God was forced to make a covenant with him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 15:9-21 we see that God confirmed His promise by making a covenant with Abraham through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way in which God made this covenant with Abraham was very peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This portion of the Word is difficult for people to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to see that God was forced to make this covenant with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As far as God was concerned, there was no need for Him to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If Abraham had immediately believed in God for the promise of the land, Genesis 15 would have been much shorter than it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There would have been no need for many things that are mentioned there: the dividing of the heifer, the she-goat, and the ram; the offering of the turtledove and the young pigeon; the deep sleep that fell upon Abraham; the horror of great darkness that came upon him; God's passing through the pieces as a smoking furnace and as a torch of fire; and the mention of the four hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems that nothing was pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not the time of sunrise but of sunset, and God did not come in a lovely way but as a smoking furnace and a flaming torch.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we had witnessed such a scene, we probably would have been frightened to death, being unable to withstand it and finding it altogether a terrifying thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This scene, however, has a very sweet flavor because in it God made a covenant with His dear called one; He had no intention of terrifying him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have spent much time in trying to understand this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the early days I could not understand it because I lacked experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I looked into some books, but none of them said anything helpful about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But eventually by experiences through the years the Lord has shown me the real significance of this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This incident in Genesis 15 is the consummation of a covenant, the record of God's enacting of a covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first covenant that God made was with Noah 9:8-17 , a covenant that had a rainbow as its sign.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here, in Genesis 15, is the second covenant made by God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to keep this fact firmly in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THREE CATTLE SIGNIFYING THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST In making His covenant with Abraham, God told him to take a heifer, a she-goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon v. 9 . The three cattle, all of which were three years of age, were divided in half, but the two birds were not; they were kept alive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was through these that God made His covenant with Abraham, implying that it was in this way that Abraham could fulfill God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see the significance of the three cattle and the two birds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In typology, all things offered to God by man are a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Based upon this principle, each of these five things undoubtedly is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is firstly the crucified Christ, the cut Christ, and secondly He is the resurrected, living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we see this, then we can immediately understand that the three cattle, which were cut and killed, are types of the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The crucified Christ was the One who became flesh, living on earth in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John chapter one says that the Word who was God became flesh v. 14 . Then it speaks of this One as the Lamb of God v. 29 . The Lamb of God was the One who was the Word of God becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, the three cattle in Genesis 15 should signify Christ in His humanity being crucified for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we read Genesis 15 along with the book of Leviticus, we can see that the female heifer was for a peace offering Lev 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why does the peace offering come first?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because when God was making a covenant with His called one, there was the need of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In making a covenant or any agreement between two parties there is the need of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for God to make a covenant with His called one, there was firstly the need of a peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And Christ was that peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The she-goat was a type of Christ as our sin offering Lev 4:28; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regardless of how good we may be as God's called ones, we are still sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, following the peace offering we need the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hallelujah, the problem of sin has been settled!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It has been taken away by Christ as our she-goat, as our sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Following this there was the need of the burnt offering, the offering which signifies that everything must be for God Lev 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the peace offering, there was the sin offering, and after the sin offering, there was the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ was all of the offerings that God passed through in making a covenant with His called one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why were the three cattle all three years old?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because Christ was not killed in death but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was not offered in death but in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Referring to His crucifixion, the Lord told the Jews, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" John 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord was killed when He was "three years old," meaning that He was killed in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even before He was killed He was already in resurrection because He was always in resurrection John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, when He was killed, He was killed in resurrection, and this was why He could be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ offered Himself to God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was nailed to the cross in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Regardless of how strong you may be, if you were to be killed, you would be killed in death, not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the Lord Jesus was killed in resurrection.</S>
