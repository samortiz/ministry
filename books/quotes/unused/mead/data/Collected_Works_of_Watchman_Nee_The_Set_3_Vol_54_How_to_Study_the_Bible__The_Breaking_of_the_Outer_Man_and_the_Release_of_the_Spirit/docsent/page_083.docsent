   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED OF BREAKING AND SEPARATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Breaking and separation are our two different needs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet there is a strong relationship between the two, and it is impossible to disassociate the two altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The outer man needs to be broken before the spirit can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But when the spirit is released, it must not be mixed with the sentiments and characteristics of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It must not carry any element that comes from man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not merely a matter of the release of the spirit, but a matter of the purity and quality of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many times when a brother stands up to speak, on the one hand, we feel the spirit and the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, on the other hand, we touch his self in his words; we touch his conspicuous spot.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His spirit is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He can give us a cause for praise, yet at the same time be a source of pain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The issue is not whether the spirit is released, but whether the spirit is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man has never been enlightened by God or judged by Him in a deep way, thereby gaining a knowledge of his outer man, the release of his spirit naturally will be accompanied by his outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When many people speak, we can sense the release of their very person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They release God, but the release of their spirit is accompanied by their own uncondemned self because many things in them have never passed through judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we contact others, they are primarily touched by our most conspicuous and outstanding elements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If our outer man is not condemned, what will be exposed as soon as we come in contact with others will be the most conspicuous element of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one can hide this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people who are not even spiritual in their own room expect to be spiritual when they stand on the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people lose their spirituality as soon as their memory fails to remind them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Their spirituality is sustained by their memory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But this is an impossible proposition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not think, "I will remember to muzzle myself today because I have to give a message; I have to work."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our memory is not our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot be saved by our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever kind of person we are will be exposed as soon as we open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter how hard a person tries to pretend, act, or cover up himself, his spirit comes out as soon as he opens his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever kind of spirit we have and whatever mixture there is in our spirit will be obvious to everyone as soon as we open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In spiritual matters, there is no way to pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we want to experience deliverance from God, this deliverance must be fundamental, not fragmentary.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has to work in us to deal with our strong point, and He has to break it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only then will our spirit be released without mixture being imparted to others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have never been touched by God in a fundamental way, we may act somewhat spiritual when we remember to do it, but we will manifest the self once our memory slips.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, in both cases, whether we remember or we forget, the spirit that we release is the same, and the things that are carried by the spirit are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The problem of mixture is the biggest problem among workers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We often touch life in the brothers, but also touch death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We touch God in the brothers, but also touch their self.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We touch a spirit of meekness, but also touch a stubborn self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We find the Holy Spirit in them, but also find the flesh in them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When they stand up to speak, others sense a mixed spirit, an impure spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If God intends for us to serve Him in the ministry of the word and if we have to speak for God, we have to ask for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to say, "God, work in me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Break my outer man, tear it down, and separate it from the inner man."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have not experienced this deliverance, we will express our outer man subconsciously every time we open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no way for us to hide it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As soon as the word goes out, the spirit goes out as well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are the kind of person we are; we cannot pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we want to be used by God, our spirit must be released, and this spirit must be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order for us to be pure, our outer man must be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If our outer man is not destroyed, we will carry our own cargo with us when we serve as ministers of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord's name will suffer loss, not on account of our lack of life, but on account of our mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord's name will suffer, and the church will suffer as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have spoken of the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we would like to speak on the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is possible for the discipline of the Spirit to come before the revelation of the Spirit, and it is possible for the order to be reversed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We can make a distinction in sequence, but when the Holy Spirit works, He does not necessarily do one thing first and then the other.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In our experience there is no set order of events.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some people experience discipline first.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Other people experience revelation first.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everyone's experience is different.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some receive the discipline of the Spirit first, then the revelation of the Spirit, and then more discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Others receive the revelation of the Spirit first, then discipline, and then more revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, among God's children there is always more discipline of the Holy Spirit than revelation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here we are speaking about experience, not doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>With many people, discipline occurs more often than revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In short, the soul and the spirit have to be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The inner man must be separated from the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The outer man must be broken, pulverized, and completely separated from the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only then will our spirit be free and pure.</S>
