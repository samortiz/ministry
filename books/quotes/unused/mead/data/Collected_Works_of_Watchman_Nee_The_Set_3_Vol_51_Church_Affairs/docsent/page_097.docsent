   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Story of Paul and Silas</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It was the same with Paul and Silas.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Thessalonica they encountered danger.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul was imprisoned, but later he was released.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After he was released, when the brothers were together, he was sent by them to Berea.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we clearly see that in this certain brother's home, the home of Jason, they were praying, seeking, and considering their future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result they said that Paul and Silas should not continue living there and that for them to remain there would be very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The brothers felt to send them perhaps to Berea.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in this instance, there was also the flavor of the fellowship of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You will remember that I mentioned yesterday that Paul had two things in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Paul sent Timothy, very often it was through fellowship, because Timothy often could not see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not that I use authority to tell you to go; rather, it is that I fellowship the Lord's desire with you so that you can walk more properly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps you did not see the importance of fellowship yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today you need to see these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Very often it is not just a matter of authority but a matter of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You need fellowship because perhaps you have not seen, no one has made a decision, and you yourself do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps the brothers made the decision, or perhaps Paul made the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if Paul made the decision, it was not through authority but through the fellowship with the house of Jason.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Thessalonica it was very clear: The brothers were together, Paul and Silas were in danger, and the Jews wanted to arrest them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What should they do?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The brothers felt that they should still go forward, so they went forward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seems that they were discussing together, and they went out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the brothers sending them to Berea was simply a fellowship in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What was the result?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The result was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bereans were better than the Thessalonians because they were willing to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not say that there was no authority, but I say that the element of fellowship was greater.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible that there was no element of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, there was fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul sent others many times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though Paul was a brother in the lead, you still have to admit that there was also an element of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are two basic principles in the coordination of God's work: authority and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When both principles are present, it is the highest leading and the most perfect coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Words of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Being Spoken through the Prophets</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Question: What would you say concerning the sending in Acts 13?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 2 says, "The Holy Spirit said.''</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Where is the fellowship?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Or is there something else?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Answer: At the time of the apostles, the words of the Holy Spirit could come from the mouths of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Among those brothers there were prophets who rose up and said, "Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul.''</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps there was not only one person, but two or three, witnessing what the Holy Spirit was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>ONLY TWO CENTERS BEING MENTIONED IN ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Question: Jerusalem and Antioch did not have much difference.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In just over ten years, how could there already be two beginnings?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Answer: It was only a period of ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible did record two beginnings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, Philippians says that there were still many people preaching the gospel although their way was not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They clearly were not from Jerusalem or Antioch, but they were another group of people who initiated another beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By this we may know that there were many beginnings at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I think that the record of the Holy Spirit in Acts and in Revelation 2 and 3 is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There were many churches in Asia, but only seven were selected to receive the epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Obviously, Ephesus and Colossae were both in Asia, but only Ephesus was mentioned, not Colossae.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Clearly the condition of Colossae was better than that of Ephesus because Ephesus had already fallen to the extent of leaving the first love and Colossae had not.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For the sake of applying the teaching, the Lord chose Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because the Lord wanted to match the teaching with history, He chose seven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I believe that all the history in Acts is for teaching; therefore, many people were omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, we are clear concerning Peter in Jerusalem and Paul in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There could have been many other beginnings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>History shows us that a group of apostles went to Africa.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to the tradition of the church, Thomas went to India.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Each way was separate, and the Bible did not bother to mention them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we cannot say that in Acts there were only two centers; we can only say that the Holy Spirit only mentioned two centers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is also like the Holy Spirit only mentioning Adam, Eve, Abel, and Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It does not mean that there were only four persons in the world at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>What this means is that only what is useful to teaching is recorded, and what is not useful to teaching is not recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Philippians 1 shows us that many gospel preachers went out.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many of them may have had situations similar to Paul's.</S>
