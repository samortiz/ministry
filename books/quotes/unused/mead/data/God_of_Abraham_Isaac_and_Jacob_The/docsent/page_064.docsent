   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through Mahanaim</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 32:1-2 says, "And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The name Mahanaim means "two camps."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a precious word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God was opening Jacob's eyes to see that as a result of his obedience to God to leave Padan-aram, God had delivered him from the hand of Laban and would deliver him from the hands of others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God opened his eyes to see that his company of people on earth was one camp, while God's army was another camp; hence, there were the "two camps."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God opened his eyes to see that the messenger of God was with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, God came to him alone and said to him, "Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While he was on his way, Laban came with a company of men, but God protected him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This proved to Jacob that God was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Laban left, God gave him a vision and showed him that there was not only a camp on earth, but another camp of heavenly hosts following him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of these incidents taught him to trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Scheming while Praying</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Under such circumstances, however, Jacob was still Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The flesh is still the flesh; it will never be reformed by God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although Jacob had seen the vision, it was a pity that he still exercised his maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us read verses 3 through 5: "And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: and I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This passage shows us that Jacob was a person who could resort to any amount of maneuvering and say any kind of despicable word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He would do anything to save himself from any disadvantage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He thought his words could change his brother's heart, but he had forgotten God's calling and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He had forgotten God's angels!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 6 says, "And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jacob was confused once again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wondered if this word was out of good intention or evil intention.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Esau was coming with four hundred men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What was his purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 7 says, "Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This shows that those who plan the most also worry the most.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more anxiety a person has, the more fear he has.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jacob could only think; he could not trust.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He could only scheme; he could not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He lived his days in fear and distress.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Those whose flesh is not dealt with can only trust in their own planning and scheming; they cannot trust in God or believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, they can only fear and worry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jacob's considerations were endless and his schemes unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was still making his own plans.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He knew that God wanted him to return and that he could not stay in Mesopotamia any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He had to find a way to return.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He could obey God, but he could not trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He could not let God be responsible for the consequences of his obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He wondered what would happen if he encountered troubles as a result of obeying God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the experience of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They often obey God "at the front door," but at the same time prepare a way of escape "through the back door."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Jacob was truly resourceful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He came up with an idea.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"He divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands" v. 7 . The "two bands" in this verse are the same as the name Mahanaim in the previous verse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jacob divided his people and cattle into Mahanaim.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He used this Mahanaim to replace that other Mahanaim.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Originally, Jacob had one band on earth and God had one band in heaven, but now Jacob divided his band into two.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said, "If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape" v. 8 . The goal of Jacob's scheme was to provide a way for escape.</S>
