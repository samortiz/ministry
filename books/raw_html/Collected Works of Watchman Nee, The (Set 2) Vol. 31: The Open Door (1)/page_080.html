<h2 class="head2">Tsinan, Shantung Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to all the brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>The brothers and sisters in the Lord in Tsinan (whom I know of, who meet at 10 Kuang-Chih Street, and the rest) are all safe. Please continue to pray for us. I believe that the Lord's blood has cleansed us, and we have been sealed. Please tell Liu Kuo-hsiang, Liu Kuo-hwa, and Liu Chu-fei that their homes and families are safe. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Jia-chi<br />December 30, 1937</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Brother Watchman in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord for really showing us that He cares for His children. In this time of distress, I have committed everything to the faithful Lord and watched His acts quietly. My faith was fully assured. Most of the brothers and sisters in Hong Kong are still safe. Although a few have had some slight problems, they have suffered no loss. On the contrary, we have received a great benefit. Now our meetings consist of a gospel meeting at 10:30 a.m. on the Lord's Day and a table meeting at 3:00 p.m. This coming Thursday (the twenty-fourth), from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m., there will be a new meeting for prayer and fellowship (to meet, shake hands, converse, etc.). However, this meeting is temporary. Once the political situation becomes stable, we will resume our prayer meeting at 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, the sisters' prayer meeting on Friday, and the discussion meeting on Saturday evenings. I have received the second issue of The Open Door. The first message on the truth is really precious. God corrected many of our mistakes through His word. I am enclosing twelve order forms. We would like to order a total of fifteen copies. Please send them all to: Yu Jia Chi, Chi-Loo University Medical School, Tsinan, Shantung. Please remember us and the Lord's work often. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Yu Jia-chi<br />January 16</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>To my son Guo-hwa (a family letter):</p><p>Everything is fine at home. Although we cannot see each other because of the political situation, we have God's leading and the Lord's presence, and we will never have wants. The brothers and sisters in Tsinan are all well. Sister Chung's family is well also. Thank the Lord.</p><p>Your mother<br />January 2</p><p>(This is one of Brother Liu Guo-hwa's letters from home&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Chefoo, Shantung Province</h2><p>Greetings to Sister Lee</p><p>whom we are concerned for in Christ:</p><p>We received the second issue of The Open Door yesterday and were so thankful when we read it. We are sending an order form today so that you can send us the next issue. After you and Sister Wang came to my house and prayed for Rui-ying, we gained a deep impression of the Lord's love. Although we do not write often, we often pray for you by name before God's throne. Rui-ying's illness has not been completely healed, so we deeply hope you will pray for her. God has given Chefoo peace. Thank those who walk in the way of loving the Lord for the grace they have given. Peace! May the work go smoothly.</p><p>Qu Tze-yuan, Luan Rui-ying<br />January 11</p>
