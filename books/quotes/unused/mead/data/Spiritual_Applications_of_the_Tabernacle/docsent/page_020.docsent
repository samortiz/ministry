   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE EIGHTFOLD SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: Exo 36:31-38; 37:1-9; Gal 2:9; Rev 3:12; John 10:9</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will review eight points related to the tabernacle that we may be more deeply impressed with them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These eight matters are basic for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE REDEMPTION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have seen that the church is built on the basis of the redemption of Christ, as typified by the one hundred silver sockets Exo 36:24, 26, 30, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The whole tabernacle was grounded on the silver sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The base and foundation of the silver sockets is one of the most significant aspects of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Exodus 38:27 tells us that the sockets were very large and heavy, each being of one talent, the equivalent of almost one hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The heaviest part of the tabernacle was the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The tabernacle was not grounded on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was based and grounded on the silver sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was something different from the earth and separated from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows us that the church is not grounded or built upon something of the earth but on something apart from the earth, the full and weighty redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One hundred, the number of the silver sockets, indicates that there is nothing short in Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is absolutely complete, full, and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the foundation of the church and the basis for the building of the Lord s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MANIFESTATION OF THE DIVINE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The foundation of the tabernacle was of silver, but the manifestation within the tabernacle was the gold 36:13, 34, 36, 38; 37:1-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From within the tabernacle, one could see almost nothing but gold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Gold signifies the divine nature with the divine life of Christ, which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is built upon the foundation of the redemption of Christ, but what the church manifests is the divine nature and divine life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Within the church, the building of God, what must be manifested is not the works, the doings of God, but the very nature and life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The manifestation of the divine nature is more significant than even the foundation of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The tabernacle was full of gold, and the church must be full of the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What we manifest, express, and show to others should be nothing other than the glorious divine nature of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE TRANSFORMED HUMAN NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is manifested in the church is the divine nature, but the manifestation of the divine nature depends upon the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gold of the tabernacle overlaid the acacia wood 36:20, 31, 36; 37:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What was manifested was the gold, but the gold overlaid the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In a sense, the gold depended upon the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This may seem strange to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may have thought that the condition of our human nature depends upon the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the picture of the tabernacle shows that the gold depends upon the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With the building of the church, the divine nature of God depends greatly upon our human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The gold did not stand upright in the tabernacle; it was the acacia wood which stood with the gold upon it 36:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Gold is a soft metal and is not hard enough to stand upright.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The standing strength for the tabernacle was not with the gold but with the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the acacia wood, the gold could not stand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we have seen, the acacia wood represents the transformed human nature and character.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to the history of the church, the building of the church has depended very much upon the transformed human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers such as Martin Luther, George M ller, and John Darby had a transformed human nature, and their character was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you would read their biographies, you could see that they were the real acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The building of the church needs the proper human character.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The manifestation in the church is the divine nature with the divine life, but the support is the human character, the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The standing strength needed for the tabernacle is with the human nature overlaid, that is, transformed, with the divine nature and divine life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The human nature and the divine nature must be mingled together.</S>
