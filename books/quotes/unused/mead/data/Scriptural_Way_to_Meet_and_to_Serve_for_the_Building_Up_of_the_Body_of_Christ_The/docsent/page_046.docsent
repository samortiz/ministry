   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE MIRACULOUS NORMALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These three items regeneration, being filled with the Spirit essentially, and being filled with the Spirit economically cover the entire Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Justification, redemption, forgiveness of sins, and the washing away of sins are included in regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sanctification, transformation, renewing, conformation, and glorification are included in the inner filling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The authority of the Lord, the position in the ascended Christ, the clothing of the Spirit of power as the uniform for ministry, the miraculous gifts such as speaking in tongues and healing, and all the activities of power are included in the outpouring of the Spirit upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Regeneration, the infilling of the Spirit, and the outpouring of the Spirit, though miraculous, are very normal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a sinner would be regenerated, he merely listens to the gospel and believes every item of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then based on his believing, he calls on the Savior s name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Romans 10:9 says, That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One minute before, this person was an unregenerated sinner, but the next minute, he is a regenerated saint.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One minute ago, he was a son of the Devil, but the next minute he is a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although regeneration is normal, it is also a great miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>D. L. Moody said that regeneration was the greatest miracle among all the miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regeneration is a great miracle because a devilish man becomes a divine man, that is, a son of the Devil immediately becomes a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regeneration is the greatest miracle, yet it takes place in such a normal way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, regeneration is a normality that is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a miraculous normality in our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be filled with the Spirit is also very normal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to be filled with the Spirit, we just need to fulfill the conditions, or terms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to make a thorough confession of our sins, pray to the Lord, and exercise our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we believed in the Lord and were regenerated, we received an allotted faith 2 Pet 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This faith is within us and we must use it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must exercise our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I usually eat a very nourishing breakfast every morning that supplies me with much energy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But during the day I have to energize, that is, I have to exercise my energy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A starving person could not exercise his energy because he has no energy with which to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The food that we have taken in is converted to the energy that we exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In like manner, we all have received the God-allotted faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have faith within us, so we can exercise this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to make a thorough confession of all our failures, defects, shortcomings, mistakes, and sinfulness to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even something small between a husband and wife is good enough to frustrate them from being filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to confess in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A husband may need to apologize to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be a clear person inwardly with the Lord and outwardly with others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I believe that the one hundred and twenty in the upper room in Jerusalem were cleared up people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why they had the faith to pray and even to claim from the Lord what He had promised them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are going to visit people with the gospel by knocking on their doors, we have to pray and make a thorough confession of our defects, shortcomings, mistakes, wrongdoings, failures, defeats, and sinfulness from within and without to get ourselves completely cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we can say, Lord, here I am under Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through Your washing, I am clean.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now I have the full position to claim and enjoy Your infilling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Standing on what the Bible says, we can claim the infilling of the Spirit by exercising our God-allotted faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we can go to preach the gospel with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can say, Lord, I am going with You, and I have the confidence and the assurance that You are going with me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I believe that not only I but also You will be there knocking on the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Formerly, we may have been afraid when we knocked on people s doors; some of us may even have been shaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But when we pray and exercise our faith in a proper way, we will never shake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our hand will be like steel, and our arm will be like brass.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we knock on the doors, we will say, Devil, get away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Door, open to me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When you are filled with the Spirit, you will not talk to people in a routine way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When someone comes to open the door and face you, you will surely have something from the Spirit to say to him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you say something to this man, you will be under the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Under the outpouring of the Spirit, you have the freedom to speak and the boldness to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You have the utterance and the assurance that you are under the Lord s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are speaking things to people with the authority of the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is so normal, but it is also so miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How marvelous it is that we can experience the miraculous normality in God s New Testament economy!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are regenerated persons who can be filled with the Spirit essentially and economically.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can go out to visit people with the heavenly, ascended Christ, with the very Christ who is sitting on the throne and who has received all the authority in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can exercise our God-allotted faith to believe that we have received the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we are filled inwardly and outwardly with the Spirit, we have the assurance that we are not speaking with our words but with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This makes a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is not necessary for us to fast for three days to experience the infilling and the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>These are normal experiences but miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>My drinking of the living water is normal, but the transpiration of such a thing is the greatest miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Triune God is the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to receive the miraculous infilling and outpouring, we do not need to do miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All we need to do is fulfill the normal requirements and conditions in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we will receive these miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whatever we receive is a miracle that is normal in our experience, so it is a miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let us exercise to experience this kind of normality under God s miraculous power.</S>
