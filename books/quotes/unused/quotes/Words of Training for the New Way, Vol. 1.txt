The second and third messages were given to the serving ones in the Living Stream Ministry office in April and May
We were born with such a background of confusion and were also affected by the confusing situation and atmosphere of Christianity
The practices in Christianity with its confusion fit in with the worldly taste and with man's natural inclination
They have also hindered and weakened the increase and spread of the church so that the church has been in a half-dormant condition
We need to come together to the pure Word of God to see what is the administration of God's New Testament economy
In Acts the Lord Jesus had gained a group of followers among whom were apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers
They were raised up by Christ, produced through the death and resurrection of Christ, and appointed by Christ in the Holy Spirit
These were the ones who preached the gospel on the earth and brought people to be saved that they might receive the life of God
On the one hand, as to the universal aspect, this group of believers is the one Body of Christ, which is God's unique church on the earth
At the same time, they teach the saints to function in the meetings and to preach the gospel fervently outside the meetings
If they all would walk according to the teaching of the apostles, then the apostles would need to help them only in the positive aspects
Not long after Paul left, there were problems including divisions, fornication, and idolatry in the church in Corinth
When there was someone in the church in Corinth who committed fornication, the apostle said, 'Remove the evil man from among yourselves'
For this reason, besides the priests God prepared a group of Levites to minister to the priests and to their services
There is only teaching and correction; at most, administration and oversight, without lording it over or controlling
God's administration in the New Testament is not by human autocracy or by human democracy, but by God Himself administrating
If the apostles, elders, deacons, and all the saints are walking according to the Bible, then they are in God's administration
The one who took the lead among the first group of brothers and was used by the Lord to release His truths was Brother Watchman Nee
At the same time, there was a group of brothers and sisters like Levites helping him in order to put into print what he had seen
Whenever he opened his mouth to give a message, there were some who would do the recording, transcribing, and polishing
At present, the Lord's recovery has spread to six continents and has more than nine hundred churches, requiring the service of more Levites
Because of the fact that it requires money to carry out anything on this earth, there is the matter of finances
According to the way of Christianity, there would definitely be the need to set up a mission to handle all the monetary offerings
The brothers in the Far East thought that since Brother Lee had gone to work in a wealthy country, he surely had received much money
Today in the United States, the property for the two ministry stations in Anaheim and Irving alone is worth a considerable amount
Not only did He become our Savior on the cross, but today, even the more, He is the indwelling Spirit to be our life and to be with us
He rose from among the dead, releasing the life of God and producing God's new creation to be the Body of Christ
We believe that the Body of Christ-the church- is unique in the entire universe, just as the moon in the sky is unique
These meetings in a larger meeting place with everyone coming together may be only once every few months, or twice a year
As apostles and co-workers, each of these brothers had his portion of work; yet they did not have many ministries
The four kinds of gifted persons mentioned in Ephesians chapter four are for the building up of the church to be the Body of Christ
It may be that many of these are not apostles, but they nevertheless have a part in the ministry borne by the apostles
Ministry' refers to the work of the Lord's move on the earth, whereas 'minister' refers to one who bears responsibility in the Lord's work
The Bible shows us very clearly that in Noah's age there was only one ministry; yet many ministers were there together building the ark
During the age of Moses, God desired to build the tabernacle with its furniture, the most important of which was the ark
In this ministry there was not only Moses himself Moses was one of many ministers and undeniably he was the leading one in that ministry
At that time, there were not two different ministries building the temple; hence, there were not two different leaderships
Anyone who had a part in the ministry of building the temple, including the stone-cutters and stone-movers, was a minister in that ministry
Now we have already seen clearly that the ministry spoken of in the Bible does not refer to a person, but to God's building work
At that time, there were quite a few brothers who had been in the Lord's recovery longer than I, and they were also older in age
For this reason, right from the start of the Lord's recovery in China, there was the problem with the matter of leadership
In 1922, when the Lord's recovery just began, the two other co-workers who served with Brother Nee were fighting for leadership
Outwardly this second group all accepted Brother Nees leadership but nearly all of them had their own opinions when they did things together
In 1972 and 1973 the Lord's recovery in the United States began to spread through migration; the number of saints increased greatly
Although here in Taiwan the name 'The Gospel Book Room' is used, what we have here is still a part of the ministry station
We all should see that the fact that the churches on the earth today can be established and supplied is altogether due to this ministry
There are a few basic principles of serving in the ministry station first no opinions are allowed and second everyone accepts one leadership
Although the ministry station is separated into three offices-Anaheim, Irving, and Taipei-there is only one management, one leadership
According to my experience, no matter how good the way is, once there are opinions, the matters will be ruined
The Lord's work in the first few years was becoming more prosperous day after day, and the number of believers increased continually
Like those who helped Moses build the tabernacle, our Levites who help the ministry should have a testimony of oneness
In this service we have no opinions, and we do not care for right or wrong; we simply love one another and are harmonious together
We have already seen that the administration of the Lord's move on the earth began with the apostles and the apostles' ministry
On the side of the church, there is the service of the church; on the side of the ministry, there is the work of the ministry
Without the help of the Levites and their service, it would have been difficult to carry out the priestly ministry in the Old Testament
You may compare the priesthood of the priests to the inward life, and the work of the Levites to the outward body
Without the body, it would be difficult for life to exist; without life, the body would be merely an empty shell
Many seeking ones in different countries have received supplies of these publications, audio tapes, and video tapes
He said that his sister had led him to see this way, and now he needed the truth materials to supply those under his leading
In the last century, especially in England, spiritual books were mushrooming like bamboo shoots after rain, being published in bundles
Of these, about eighteen languages have already been completed, in order to meet the needs of different countries
The saved ones in every place and many who are hungry for the Lord desire the truth and the understanding of the Bible
The greatest need now is for the ministry station to quickly put out the publications, audio tapes, and video tapes
At present we are promoting the new way of going out to preach the gospel by door-to-door visitation and establishing home meetings
If there are publications available for reading and audio tapes for listening, it will be easy for people to get into the truths
In the New Testament, Paul also had a group of people serving him, although he did not use the term 'ministry station'
It was the same with the Lord Jesus when He was on the earth; even His food supply was taken care of by that group of serving ones
Now the Lords recovery has spread to the six major continents there are those everywhere who love the Lord and hunger after the Lords truth
It does not mean that we have no supply; rather, we have the top supply here, but these supplies are not fully distributed yet
The raising up of the work of the ministry and of the ministry station is entirely for the establishing of churches
If the churches cooperate with the ministry and the ministry station, their effectiveness will definitely increase significantly
Today, the ministry station is set up in three places: Anaheim, Irving, and Taipei, with over sixty brothers and sisters altogether
They are a group of serving ones serving the ministry, cooperating with the ministry to distribute the truths and the publications
We really saw the Lord's confirmation in that, although the expenses were great, the Lord's supply was abundant
Not only did they send people to coordinate and serve, but they also allowed the training to have the full use of the facilities
There is no difference whether you come from the churches or the ministry station; we all need to put our shoulders to the work
When he fellowshipped about the matter of issuing publications, he took the opportunity to make some arrangements
In addition, he made it clear that the finances of the bookroom in each place should be taken care of by each respective place
The ministry does not interfere with the finances of the church, and the church does not interfere with the finances of the bookroom
In the past, when Brother Nee was taking the lead, he never took the position of the head, as in a worldly organization
If you see any place that needs to be swept or cleaned as you are going in and out here, you should do it spontaneously
Today the Lord has given us the best opportunity here in Taipei to live out the vision we have seen concerning the Body of Christ
What we are doing today is to cause the Lord's recovery on the earth to be perfected, and to allow the Lord's recovery to spread out from us
We thank the Lord that at the end of this age, He has raised up His recovery on the earth, and has also chosen us and put us in His recovery
Although we are weak and unworthy, the Lord nevertheless has brought His recovery to every place on this earth through us
We look to the Lord for His visitation that we may be filled with God Himself and with reality in all our services
Chapter twenty, verse 22, says, 'And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit'
From these four verses in the Gospel of John we have noted eight important terms the Word God flesh grace reality spirit life and breath
After the training is over, when you go out to preach the gospel, you may preach eight messages consecutively with one message on each term
It may seem that these three items-the Word, God, and flesh-are very concrete; yet they became the abstract Spirit, life, and breath
If a person has the first six of these items, it is guaranteed that he will have the last two items of grace and reality
According to the letters, this book is very simple, but according to the philosophy it contains, it is the most profound
The Lord Jesus said, 'I am the resurrection and the life,' and, 'I am the light of the world,' and again, 'I am the way'
In chapter 20, after the Lord Jesus had resurrected, He came into the midst of the disciples and did one thing
Everyone would think that this wonderful Savior coming back in resurrection would definitely teach the disciples with a long discourse
No one would have thought that the Lord Jesus would not give a sermon, but would breathe into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
In resurrection He came back into the midst of His disciples and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Every believer's knowledge of the Lord should emphasize these two points: the Lord is the Word and also the Spirit to us
We are human beings, real human beings; but we are a group of human beings who take God as our life, live God, and express God
When some people rebuke others, they may say, 'You see, you really look like a monkey,' or, 'You see, you really look like a turtle'
When those gamblers were carried away with their gambling, none of them looked like human beings; they all looked like demons
Man cannot utter what God is; yet God expresses Himself through the Word, and He uses the Word to represent Himself
If there is only God without the Word, then man has no way to understand; if there is the Word, then God can be described and expressed
Did the Chinese character for 'Word' in that verse refer to the same Chinese character used for doctrine, or for morality, or for pathway?
Soon after such a lesson, the child will commit some wrongdoing and then immediately fabricate a story to tell you another lie
Rather, we need to lead the little children to pray-read the Lord's word and let this word become the breath to enter into them
When such a child wants to do something wrong within him something will not allow him to do it rather will require him to abide in reality
Besides the Bible, it is the most respectable philosophy among all the philosophies, without much mixture or fables or unclean things
Although he did not say much about God, Confucius nevertheless had some words expressing his viewpoint concerning God
He had not received any revelation to see Christ, nor had he received any vision to see that Christ has a Body in the universe
Not only was he different from the prophets in the Old Testament, but he was also different from the other apostles in the New Testament
There were more than forty writers of the sixty-six books of the Bible, but only this writer Paul spoke concerning the Body of Christ
The Chinese Union Version added the word 'the Lord's' to make the translation read, 'Not discerning the Lord's body'
What Paul meant to tell us here is that there is something unique in the universe that we need to discern, that is, the Body of Christ
Finally, at the end of the New Testament, there is the fourth great person, the bride, which is also the New Jerusalem
God's economy is God's administration, and God's administration is God's plan, arrangement, intention, and work
He scattered those whom He had chosen and predestinated before the ages among different tongues, tribes, peoples, and nations
President Roosevelt proposed the rebuilding of the international order, completely eliminating all the unequal treaties among nations
In addition, there is the convenience of transportation shortening the distance between the United States and China
People have come here to Taiwan from all six major continents of the earth that we may all be mingled together
Formerly, there was discrimination even among those of the same country, not to say among those of different nations
In the beginning, when brothers and sisters were considering marriage, it would make a difference where each one came from
Formerly, you could be a Christian in a locality with your door closed and not be bothered with the brothers and sisters in other places
Some even volunteered to come to serve, to help in such things as digging the tunnel, plastering walls, and working in the kitchen
Corinthians 12:18 says, 'But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed'
Before the Lord Jesus was born, God caused the Roman Empire to be raised up so that many of the prophecies in the Bible could be fulfilled
If there had been no Roman Empire, the Lord would not have been born in Bethlehem and yet have grown up in Nazareth
Today after two thousand years God has brought this world to a blended stage so that there are almost no distinctions between East and West
Taiwan has large quantities of goods made in the United States, and the United States also has large quantities of goods made in Taiwan
Since this is the case, in our church life today we need to be mingled with all the brothers and sisters on the earth
If you do not have the grace, the light, or this vision of the Body, then the training center is a place of suffering to you
If you have the vision, then the training center is not only a place for training you, but also a place for perfecting you
From now on, not only are we who are in Taipei in one accord, but the entire recovery of the Lord in the whole universe is also one
It is God the Son who came to accomplish redemption according to the selection and predestination of God the Father
It is not only able to kill germs and remove the uncleanness, but also able to supply all the life elements needed by the body
The sealing in Ephesians chapter one includes regeneration, transformation, filling, transfusion, saturation, and glorification
The Holy Spirit is carrying out this work of transfusion within us day by day; even at the time we lose our temper, He does not stop
The result of this sealing is that the contents and elements of the Triune God with all that He has accomplished are transfused into us
She is the Lord's own Body, the Father's dwelling place, the gathering of the called ones, God blended with man's race
The all-inclusive, processed Triune God is mingled with the God-created, regenerated, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite man
In the Lord's recovery, we are not merely helping you trainees go out to knock on doors, preach the gospel, and baptize people
Before we were saved, we were a group of walking corpses living in sins, having no feeling toward sins whatsoever
At that time, we 'walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air,
We are not reconciled to God one by one individually, but we all in one Body of Christ are once and forever reconciled to God
Even before we were born, we and all the believers throughout the ages were reconciled to God in Christ and in His one Body
Ephesians chapter one speaks of deliverance from sins, chapter two speaks of deliverance from death, and chapter three speaks of grace
We need to go back to the apostolic age to receive and carry on the way of meeting as it was when the apostles were on earth
At present, among the different halls of the church in Taipei, there are about thirty-five hundred in the meeting on the Lord's Day
After hearing Brother Nee's word that day, for the past fifty years we have been trying to eliminate this thing from among us
It says And every day in the temple and from house to house they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
When the Apostle Paul spoke concerning the whole church coming together, he even used the expression 'each one'
We did see it, but we did not know how to practice it; therefore, we did not make a special effort to carry it out
After that, we lead him to meet together with his family members, and with his neighbors and relatives, to speak Jesus to them
If we want to keep the way of meeting as revealed in the New Testament, then we must exercise ourselves in every meeting
There is another vital point about the meetings as revealed in the New Testament that is in these meetings first there needs to be the word
If these four matters are not carried out properly, our meetings will be finished, and no one will want to come again
Recently, we have had the propagation groups here enjoying the Lord through pray-reading, and the benefits are not small
In the last chapter we considered the way of meeting as revealed in the New Testament, and we described its general outline
God does not want the law to be the center of His people's meetings any longer, but rather He wants His Spirit to be the center
In the New Testament, whenever we meet together, not only do we have the knowledge of redemption, but we also have its reality
Not only do we preach the doctrine of redemption, but we also teach this matter of redemption and help people to be redeemed
In the Old Testament, even if people wanted to be redeemed, they could not be redeemed because redemption had not yet been accomplished
At most, they could only have the knowledge of redemption and the type of redemption, which was merely a shadow
Since the meetings of the New Testament are of the Holy Spirit, of life, and of reality, strictly speaking, there is no need of teaching
We may not have felt uncomfortably hot before he spoke, but the more he talks, on the contrary, the hotter we feel
According to the revelation of the entire book of Ephesians, to be filled in spirit is to be filled with the Triune God
Ephesians 3:17 also says that Christ the Son is not only in our spirit, but even the more, He wants to make home in our hearts
More victory give me, More strength to o'ercome, More freedom from earth-stains, More quest for the throne, More fit for the Kingdom
Rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore, It is better to sing than be sighing: It is better to live than be dying; So let us rejoice evermore
At any rate, we must be living persons, filled with the Holy Spirit, in order to be qualified to have Christian meetings
Due to the degraded system of meeting Christianity has caused all the Sundaygoers to become either dead or sick or paralyzed in their spirit
The entire New Testament takes this as the key, as the secret, as far as the revelation of our experience of the Lord is concerned
If we had a thorough realization, we would feel that we have absolutely no way to carry out this matter by ourselves
When you go to knock on doors to preach the gospel, it is not only you who are going, but the Triune God going together with you
When someone opens the door, it is not necessary to say the same thing every time, 'I am sent by such-and-such church'
You need to realize, however, that it is not you alone who are going, but the Triune God who has mingled Himself with you is going with you
Once He came out of death and entered into resurrection, He was transfigured from the likeness of the flesh to the likeness of the Spirit
After the Lord had become the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, He came back into the midst of the disciples
After He came back, He breathed into the disciples, signifying that He breathed Himself into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
In order to defend their erroneous teaching concerning the Trinity degraded Christianity absolutely will not admit that Christ is the Spirit
When He came back in His resurrection, the first thing He did was to enter into man's spirit to regenerate his spirit
One of the Chinese hymns contains this word: 'All the normal relationships between God and man are altogether in the Spirit'
The chorus says, 'The Spirit begets the spirit, the spirit worships the Spirit, and eventually the Spirit will fill me'
In Christianity, most of the teachers consider the matter of being filled with the Spirit as a very miraculous and extraordinary thing
Christ went through death and resurrection to become the Spirit; hence, the New Testament is also the age of the Spirit
As long as you receive any gospel word in the Bible, this word within you is Spirit, and this Spirit is simply Christ
Once you call on the name of the Lord, the Lord who is the Spirit within you will carry out His deliverance so that you may obtain salvation
When a sinner hears the gospel, he is moved to repent and call on the Lord from within, saying, 'O Lord Jesus!
When we weep, repent, and call on the name of the Lord, we always have a very good feeling and the sense of the Lord's presence
When we get up in the morning, the best thing for us to do is not to think about other things, but only to think about the Lord Jesus
There is a difference between calling on the Lord the first thing before getting out of bed, and getting out of bed without calling
When there is no one with you, you should call on the Lord Jesus; when there are others with you, you should speak the Lord Jesus to them
You should begin with calling on the Lord before getting out of bed, and then during the day, either call on the Lord or speak the Lord
As soon as you call on the Lord's name, the Spirit is with you; as soon as you speak the Lord's word, the Spirit will be with you even more
God uses the tangible physical things in the universe to signify, represent, and describe the invisible spiritual things
If you are ill, you do not depend only on taking medicine, but you must also depend on the organic function of the body itself
It is first conceived in the mother's womb; after development, the members of the body gradually become formed, and then the baby is born
Every one of us is born with all the organic functions of our entire body; these functions are even the same in all of us
All the wonderful expressions, words of wisdom, and mysterious points in the Bible adequately prove the existence of God in the universe
They have also made the matter of the Holy Spirit coming upon men and the Holy Spirit filling men a rare and strange thing
It was only after a few days that he realized that he was saved and that the Spirit of God had entered into him
Romans 10:6 says, 'But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?
No one can cause Christ to come down from heaven, and then to descend to the abyss, and be resurrected from the dead
After a person hears the gospel, before he calls on the Lord and believes, Christ is already in his mouth and in his heart
Although now you have not believed in Him yet, this Savior, along with the word of the gospel that you heard, has come into you already
The resurrected Christ as the reality of the filling of the Holy Spirit is within us, accompanying us day by day
He only needs to confess Him as Lord with his mouth, that is, to open his mouth and call on His name, and he shall be saved
Verse 10 follows, saying, 'For with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth man confesses unto salvation'
Romans chapter eight shows us that God coming into us to be our life is such a normal matter that it has become a law
When we set our mind on the spirit to cooperate with the law of the Spirit of life, the issue is life and peace
In the universe, among the human race, there is also the word of God written and printed here, and it has been left in our hands
Day by day you will be saved and filled with the Holy Spirit, and you will allow the Holy Spirit to descend upon you
According to my observation, for the most part your meeting this morning has been like a theatrical performance
We need to see that regardless of where we are meeting, the basic element of our meeting is the worship of God
What the Lord intended here was to guide her to confess and repent for the sin of adultery she had committed by marrying many husbands
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship'
The Lord Jesus immediately corrected her, saying, 'Neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father'
The Lord told her clearly that God is Spirit and that man worships Him neither in this place nor in that place, but in his spirit
The worship as revealed in the New Testament and what has been passed on to us by Christianity are absolutely different
There is no one, however, who drinks the living water on the one hand, and performs and makes fun on the other
In the meetings, everyone should be joyful, living, not restricted or bound, but not making fun with one another according to the flesh
Suppose we have learned the way of not giving a message, but speaking one to another with the contents of the hymns
Once you try this, you will know that speaking to one another gives a strong inspiration and grants a deep impression
He said that the Lord's Day message meeting is something of a waste, and that we should not consider this as the church meeting
At that time we saw that we should not maintain the Sunday morning meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening
We had no other way in our practice, because once we drop this practice of giving a message, there would be nothing else to replace it
The churches, especially those in the United States, responded to this immediately and offered abundantly for this cause
Until now, we have spent three full years of time; thank the Lord, we have already obtained a very good result
7:38 says that once we believe in the Lord, we receive the Spirit; the result is that there are rivers of living water flowing out of us
These three portions of the Scriptures show us that the Triune God as the Word becomes the Spirit to enter into us
To us the Triune God is just like air, being with us in every place at every time, although we are not conscious of Him
Throughout the years many experienced ones among us have spent a lot of effort to compile many psalms and spiritual songs
These are printed in our hymnal and are ready to be used, without the need at any time for us to compile or to consider
O glorious Christ, Savior mine, Thou art truly radiance divine; God infinite, in eternity, Yet man in time, finite to be
In this way through our speaking with the spirit, the Triune God who fills us within will flow out like rivers of living water
Ephesians speaks concerning being filled with the Spirit, and Colossians speaks concerning being filled with the word
Someone may select Matthew 1:1, saying, 'The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham'
In this way our meetings will become living and will be able to entirely replace the meetings of one person speaking with the rest listening
We need to continue what we have studied and emphasized here in the past and see together the secrets of building up the home meetings
If you want the meetings to be living and rich, they need to be full of the Lord's word, and the word must have the Spirit
If the word does not have the spirit, then it is merely the letter; it is dead and empty, and it causes people to be depressed
Fundamentally, Christian meetings should be full of the word of God, and the word of God should be filled with the mingled Spirit of God
In the recent past, we have conducted some experiments to practice these four things in different kinds of meetings
Neither should it be that you talk so roughly in your daily living, yet you speak so gently when you are in the meetings
The entire New Testament reveals to us that Christian living is not a matter of teaching and doctrine, but a matter of the Spirit
According to the entire revelation of the book of Ephesians, to be filled in spirit is to be filled with the Triune God
From this you can see that the living of the members of the Body of Christ must be filled in spirit with the Triune God
When the time comes an elder will call a hymn another elder will offer a prayer and then a brother who does the speaking will give a message
In today's Christianity, whether Catholicism or Protestantism, and even among us, the general situation of the meeting is like this
If we cannot have a breakthrough on this point by the Lords mercy regardless of what kind of change we have in our ways it will be useless
Now the key is how to bring the brothers and sisters into the spirit to live and walk by the Spirit daily and to become overcomers
If there are ten persons meeting, and four or five among them are like this, then there will be no problem with that meeting
The psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs mentioned in Ephesians chapter five are not only in the Bible, but also in our hymnal
O glorious Christ, Savior mine, Thou art truly radiance divine; God infinite, in eternity, Yet man in time, finite to be
When you come to the meeting, if you have the inspiration within, you may tell everyone, 'Let us turn to Matthew 5:3'
When you read these nine blessings in a living way with some declarations, everyone will receive the edification
When we live by the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit, the result is that we will be able to bear the fruit of the Spirit
