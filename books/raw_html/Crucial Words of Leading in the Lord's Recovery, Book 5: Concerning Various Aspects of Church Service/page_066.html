	 <h2 class="head2">The Practice of the Initial Church</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved. After that there were big meetings in the temple. If Peter had not been a speaker in a meeting, John would have been. Their meetings must have had one person speaking and the rest listening. This was absolutely good for them at that time, because except for the one hundred twenty who prayed in the upper room, none of the other Jews knew the gospel. In Acts 2 Peter gave the first gospel message to three thousand people. Afterward, each of these three thousand taught others from house to house. Hence, the example in the Bible shows that after the saints were saved, day by day they continued steadfastly in one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house (v. 46). The advantage of having big meetings was to produce those who could meet with others and teach from house to house.</p>
<p>It is likely that the three thousand met in hundreds of homes. If there had only been Peter, it would have been impossible for him to go to these homes and speak to all of them. So who was the speaker in the homes? The most likely solution is that those in each home meeting took care of teaching. The initial church produced teachers very quickly. We can say that Peter hit two birds with one stone. On the one hand, he preached the gospel, and some were saved; on the other hand, his preaching was a demonstration that showed others how to teach. His first message also produced teachers who could speak the same thing. This is the example set forth in the Bible.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that Christianity has preserved the practice of only giving messages in the temple but has dropped the practice of meeting from house to house. When we began the work in Taiwan, the number of people increased greatly, and we began the practice of small groups. However, gradually we also went downward, because we dropped the practice of the small groups and stressed only the big meeting. In every aspect it is easier to have the big meetings. It is easier for the elders, the co-workers, and the saints, because all we need to do is to bring our Bible bag to the meeting. This matches what Christianity calls the &ldquo;Sunday service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us take singing in the meeting as an example. Two brothers lead the singing, and everyone follows mechanically. With so many people in the meeting, are there not some who know how to sing? It may be that the brothers leading the singing annul the singing function of the saints. We do not want a dead way; we are living stones. Living stones do not need to wait to be told when to sing; instead, living stones sing spontaneously. This also applies to the brothers who lead the Scripture reading. It seems as though many saints are unable to find the verses and need to be told which page to turn to. This situation has evolved among us because we stress the big meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Everyone Functioning in the Small Group Meeting</h2>
<p>We attend big meetings on the Lord&rsquo;s Day fifty-two weeks a year. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day we meet in the same way. This has cultivated a habit among us. When it is time to sing, only the brothers who lead the singing function. When it is time for the Scripture reading, only the ones who lead the Scripture reading function. When it is time for the message, only the one speaking on the podium functions. Every year only two brothers exercise their function during the singing, only two brothers exercise their function during the Scripture reading, only one brother functions to speak, and only one brother exercises his function to pray. In one meeting only six saints function: two during the singing, two in the Scripture reading, one in speaking, and one in the prayer. Although this seems like a big help to the other saints, none of the other saints need to exert their strength or exercise their function. They only need to sit and listen. We must see that these six people have not done anyone a favor; rather, they have annulled the organic function of all the saints.</p>
<p>In a small group meeting the members must do everything. This includes singing, reading the Scriptures, speaking, or praying. The brothers who can sing, read the Scriptures, speak, or pray are not the only members of Christ&rsquo;s Body; every saved believer is also a member of Christ&rsquo;s Body. The big meetings are for us to learn. After these lessons in the big meetings, every saint should exercise his function in the small groups. The situation in which one person speaks and the rest listen should not continue among us. We are members of the Body of Christ, and each of us should exercise his portion and function. From now on we need to rise up and earnestly pursue to promote the small groups.</p>
