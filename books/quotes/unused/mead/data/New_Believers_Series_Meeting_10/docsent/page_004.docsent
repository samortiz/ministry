   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here I should mention another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever we meet and whenever we fellowship with one another mutually, we should remember that, as believers, we are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read some verses:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word whether means that there is no distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Body of Christ there are no worldly distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and were given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Galatians 3:27-28 says, "For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were baptized into Christ, and we have also put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free man, male or female, because we have all become one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Colossians 3:10-11 says, "And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both Galatians 3:28 and Colossians 3:11 use the phrase there cannot be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There cannot be any distinctions because we have put on the new man; we are being constituted into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This new man is created according to God Eph 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is only one entity, and all have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In reading these three portions of the Scripture, we notice that the believers are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord there is no distinction of past status.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the new man and in the Body of Christ, there is no difference whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we introduce these manmade distinctions into the church, the relationship among the brothers and sisters will be shifted to the wrong ground.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have mentioned five distinctions so far: the distinction between Greek and Jew, between free man and slave, between male and female, between barbarian and Scythian, and between circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The distinction between Greek and Jew means two things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First the Jews and the Greeks are two different races; they belong to two different countries.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Body of Christ, in Christ, and in the new man, there cannot be Jew or Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Jews should not boast that they are descendants of Abraham and God's chosen people, and they should not despise all foreigners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must realize that both Jews and Greeks have been made one in Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Boundaries no longer exist in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Lord all have become brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot divide God's children into different classes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Body of Christ and in the new man, there is only one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you bring the idea of kinship and regional flavor into the church, you do not know what the church of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You are in the church now, and you must see that we have no distinction between Jew and Greek here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a hard thing for the Jews to give up this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Bible says that in Christ there cannot be Jew and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is another distinction between the Jews and the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jews have a zealous and religious temperament, while Greeks represent an intellectual temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Historically, whenever you speak of religion, people think of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever you speak of science and philosophy, people think of the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a distinction in character.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, no matter how different their characters are, Jews can be Christians, and Greeks also can be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are zealous for religion can be Christians, and those who are intellectual also can be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Christ, there is no distinction between Jews and Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One is concerned with the feeling of the conscience, and the other is concerned with reasoning and deduction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are these two different?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the flesh, they definitely are different in disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One acts according to feelings, and the other acts according to intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in Christ there is no distinction between Jews and Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A warm person can be a Christian, and a cold person also can be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The one who walks by intuition can be a Christian, and the one who walks by reason also can be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All kinds of people can be Christians.</S>
