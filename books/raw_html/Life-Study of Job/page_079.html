<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ELIHU'S TURN TO SPEAK<br>CHAPTERS 32&#151;37</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ELIHU'S FIRST CORRECTION<br>AND REFUTATION OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 32&#151;33</H1><P>In this message we will consider Elihu's first correction and refutation of Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. HIS ANGER BEING KINDLED</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Against Job</H2><P>The anger of Elihu was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God (32:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Against Job's Three Friends</H2><P>Elihu's anger was kindled also against Job's three friends because they found no answer but had condemned Job (v. 3).</P><P>Elihu thought of himself as wise, but in being angry against Job and his three friends he was very foolish. It is not wise to be burning with anger. We need to learn to be slow to anger. If we are angry, we should not do anything. Particularly in this matter of anger, we need to learn not to act in haste. If we allow ourselves to calm down when we are angry, we will be saved from making foolish mistakes caused by speaking or acting in anger.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WAITING TO SPEAK<br>BECAUSE THE OTHERS WERE OLDER THAN HE</H2><P>Elihu had waited to speak with Job because the others were all older than he (vv. 4-14). In verses 6 and 7 he said, "I am young,/And you are aged;/Therefore I shrank back and was afraid/To declare to you what I know./I said, Let age speak,/And let the multitude of years make wisdom known." Following this, he declared that it is not the great who are wise nor the old who understand justice. Then to these older ones Elihu said, "Hear me;/I too will declare what I know" (v. 10). Elihu's word here indicates that he was quite proud.</P><P>Elihu's detailed explanation in verses 11 through 13 is a further indication that he was lacking in wisdom. When a wise person says something, he speaks in a direct manner, without unnecessary words.</P>
