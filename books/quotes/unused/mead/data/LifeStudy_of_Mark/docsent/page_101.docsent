   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WONDERFUL VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Gospel of Mark we see Peter, John, James, and other faithful ones following the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From their point of view, they were following the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But from the Lord s point of view, He was preparing them to be brought into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the time they came to Jericho, they were fully prepared for this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By entering into the Lord s death and resurrection, the disciples could have the enjoyment of the Lord and experience Him as their replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, on the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty were those who had been replaced by the Lord and who were enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They all had been brought into the Lord s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through His death and resurrection they were participating in Him, a living, all-inclusive Person, as their replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the disciples also had a rich entrance into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, on the day of Pentecost we see a picture of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With Peter and the one hundred twenty on the day of Pentecost, we have a manifestation of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This manifestation includes the full enjoyment of Christ as the universal, all-inclusive replacement through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How was it possible for the one hundred twenty to be in the kingdom of God on the day of Pentecost?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was possible only through their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to chapter one of Acts, the one hundred twenty were Galileans.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although they were from Galilee, the Lord Jesus brought them through many things to Jerusalem, where they entered into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord was crucified, these Galileans were there and witnessed His death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, they passed through crucifixion with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, they were brought into the Lord s resurrection and saw His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then on the day of Pentecost the Lord as the Spirit was poured upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All that they had seen and passed through became a reality to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They had seen the Lord s death, they had entered into His resurrection, and they had witnessed His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when the Lord as the Spirit was poured upon them, all these matters became a reality to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that they were in the Lord s death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They were participating in the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as the universal replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all need to have such a vision when we read the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not have this vision, we shall not be able to get into the depths of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Apparently, Mark is a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, it is not a book of stories but a book containing a wonderful vision.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we read the chapters of this Gospel, it is as if we are watching a heavenly television, and scene after scene is telecast into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise the Lord for such a vision!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We thank the Lord for showing us how His intimate followers are qualified, perfected, equipped, and made ready to enter into His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The lengthy section from 4:35 through 10:52 presents a clear picture of how Galileans who once were very natural could be prepared to enter into the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the end of chapter ten, they are fully made ready to come to Jerusalem, that is, to enter into the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE GREATEST MIRACLE IN THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Next to Christ Himself, the death and resurrection of Christ are the two greatest matters in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only the Person of Christ Himself is greater than these.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Apart from Christ Himself, nothing is as great as His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have seen that actually the Lord Jesus in going toward Jerusalem was proceeding toward His death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then through His death He entered into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus walked boldly from Capernaum to Jerusalem in order to enter into death.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God and the entire creation were waiting for this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jesus knew that He was going to Jerusalem to carry out a great, all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Knowing the appointed time, the date of His death, He walked boldly to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may say that the greatest miracle in the universe was the Lord s entering into and accomplishing His all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to Hebrews 12, the Lord was happy with what lay before Him v. 2 . He knew that there was a joy set before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, He went up to Jerusalem that He might accomplish God s purpose through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What a great step that was in God s economy!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a very significant matter that in carrying out His all-inclusive death, the Lord brought all of us into death with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we see this, we shall not regard the Gospel of Mark merely as a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, we shall see that this book conveys a great revelation.</S>
