<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE CHURCH THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class=msg>(11)</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW MAN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw that the new man was created by Christ in Himself on the cross by His abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances. In this message we shall first see that the new man was created according to God and in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Then we shall go on to consider other aspects of the church as the new man.<h2 class=head4>d. According to God</h2><p>Ephesians 4:24 says, “And have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.” The old man was created according to the image of God outwardly without God’s life and nature (Gen. 1:26-27). But the new man was created according to God Himself inwardly, with God’s life and nature.<p>Actually, for the new man to be created according to God is for the new man to be created according to God’s image. To be created “according to God” means to be created according to the image of God.<p>Because the new man has been created in Christ and with Christ according to God, the new man bears the image of God. Eventually, the new man will bear the image of God in holiness and righteousness of the reality.<h2 class=head4>e. In Righteousness and Holiness of the Truth</h2><p>Ephesians 4:24 tells us that the new man was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Righteousness is being right with God and with man according to God’s righteous way; the denotation of the word “holiness” here in Greek, different from that of the word “holy” in Romans 1:2, is being godly and devout before God. Righteousness is mainly toward men, and holiness mainly toward God.<p>Righteousness and holiness here refer to the two main characteristics of the life of Jesus in His humanity as indicated in verse 21. The new man is created according to God in both of these aspects.<p>The righteousness and holiness of the new man are of “the truth.” The article before “truth” in verse 24 is emphatic. As the deceit in verse 22, related to the old man, is the personification of Satan, so truth here, related to the new man, is the personification of God. This truth was exhibited in the life of Jesus, as mentioned in verse 21. In the life of Jesus righteousness and holiness of truth were always being manifested. It was in the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created.<p>Dean Alford says that in 4:24 truth denotes the essence of God, for God is truth. This is in contrast to the lusts of the deceit mentioned in verse 22. Deceit is the essence of Satan, who is a liar, but truth is the essence of God, who is truth. Thus, the lusts are of Satan, who is the deceit, whereas righteousness and holiness are of God, who is the truth. M. R. Vincent points out that in these verses deceit and truth should be personified. The new man is created according to God in righteousness and holiness, two aspects of God’s essence.<p>Righteousness, holiness, and the truth in 4:24 are actually God Himself. All these are embodied in Christ. Therefore, righteousness is Christ, holiness is Christ, and the truth is Christ. When Christ created the new man on the cross through His death, He did this according to God in Himself as righteousness, holiness, and the truth. This is marvelous. In the present age we cannot exhaust the experience of Christ as righteousness, holiness, and the truth. When we are in the New Jerusalem, however, we shall realize and understand how Christ created us into the new man through His cross according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth. We shall understand that all these are attributes of Christ. Christ created us according to God in Himself as all these attributes. He is the model, the mold. In His work of creation on the cross, He molded us in Himself. As a result, we shall bear His image; that is, we shall bear His righteousness, holiness, and the truth.<p>Whereas Ephesians 4:24 says that the new man was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth, Colossians 3:10 says that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him. The image of Christ in Colossians 3:10 is the righteousness and holiness of the truth in Ephesians 4:24. Christ is the image of God and the embodiment of God (Col. 1:15; 2:9). When He was on earth, He was a man who was righteous and holy and full of love and light. This was God’s image expressed in the Man Jesus. Today the church as the new man bears the image of God; that is, the new man bears God’s righteousness and holiness and also His love and light.
