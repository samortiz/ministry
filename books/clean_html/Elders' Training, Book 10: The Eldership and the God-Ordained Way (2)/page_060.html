<P>Among all the tests of the oneness of the Body and of the one accord of the church listed above, only three&#151;divisions, heresies, and fornication&#151;are intolerable and need a quarantine by the churches and the saints according to the apostles' teaching. Divisions damage the Body of Christ, and heresies insult the person of Christ and also damage the work of Christ. Thus, divisions are related negatively to the Body of Christ, and heresies are related negatively to Christ in His person and His work. Fornication is a gross sin that damages the humanity made by God to be the members of the Body of Christ. If these three things are taking place in the church, the Body of Christ would be annulled, the very Christ would be altogether damaged, and the humanity used as the constituents of the Body of Christ would be fully corrupted. Therefore, these three problems cannot be tolerated, and we should exercise to quarantine those who are involved in these problems, in order to preserve the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>I hope that we will spend some time to learn the proper way to face each kind of problem. We all must be impressed that among so many kinds of problems, only three are intolerable. Even with those involved in the three intolerable sins, we must be careful to deal with them in our spirit by the Spirit. We should be careful to carry out a quarantine over them to restrict the spreading of the contagious diseases. Concerning all the others, we must exercise our longsuffering, with love, in hope of recovering them. There might be a few hopeless cases. Concerning the three problems of division, heresy, and gross sin, we need to be very careful in dealing with those involved, in order that the building up of the Body of Christ may proceed in a proper way, not allowing the Body of Christ to be damaged by divisions, Christ to be damaged by heresies, and the humanity that is for the Lord's Body to be damaged by gross sins. Such a study of fifty-one cases in the New Testament as tests of the genuine oneness and the proper one accord helps us to find the proper way to solve our present problem in the rebellion among us. Thus, it also is a part of the scriptural remedy for our problem.</P><P>We have studied the genuine oneness in chapter three, the proper one accord in chapter four, and the fifty-one negative cases as tests of the genuine oneness and of the proper one accord in this chapter. I consider the genuine oneness as our constitution, the proper one accord as our law, and the tests as cases of judgment. The case of the present rebellion in the Lord's recovery should be judged according to our constitution (the genuine oneness), our law (the proper one accord), and the fifty-one cases for reference. If a just judgment were to be rendered, none of the fifty-one cases could be used as an example to judge any item of the dissenting ones' accusations against us as a case that requires a quarantine. In contrast, there are cases on the list of tests that can be used as strong examples to judge our case against the dissenting ones as a case that needs a thorough quarantine.</P>
