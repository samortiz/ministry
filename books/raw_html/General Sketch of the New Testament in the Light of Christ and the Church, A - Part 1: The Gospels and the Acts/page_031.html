<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE CRUCIAL TRANSITION FROM THE GOSPELS TO THE ACTS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 20:22; 1 Pet. 1:3; Acts 1:5; 2:1-4; 11:15-16; 2:36; Psa. 2:6; 1 Cor. 12:13</h1><p>At the end of the four Gospels and the beginning of Acts, there is a crucial transition. We also must pass through the same kind of transition, not merely in the knowledge of these matters but even more in our experience.<p>As we have seen, the four Gospels show us a picture of the Lord Jesus living, walking, working, and acting on the earth by the divine life and in the divine Spirit. In the Acts, there are thousands of persons as His Body, the church, who live, walk, work, and act in the same life and by the same Spirit. The persons have changed, but the life and the Spirit are still the same. The change is not one of life; it is one of persons. This is the crucial transition from the Gospels to the Acts.<h2 class=head1>THE IMPARTATION OF LIFE THROUGH THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2><p>This change in persons was accomplished by the Lord’s resurrection and ascension. Resurrection is a matter of life, whereas ascension is a matter of authority and power. Because many Christians today are not clear about the Lord’s resurrection and His ascension, we need to speak something further concerning these two points.<p>As we saw in previous chapters, by His death and resurrection, the Lord imparted Himself into us as our life. When Christ was resurrected from the dead, we were raised up together with Him, that is, resurrected with Him (Eph. 2:6). Moreover, 1 Peter 1:3 says, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.” God has regenerated us through the resurrection of Christ from the dead. Before His resurrection, Christ and we were separate, but by His resurrection Christ came into us to be our life and our very nature.<p>John 12:24 says, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.” The Lord Jesus as the one grain of wheat became many grains through His death and resurrection. For a grain of wheat to fall into the earth signifies death, and for it to grow up out of the earth signifies resurrection. Moreover, the grain of wheat grows up not merely by itself but with many other grains. Many grains are raised up and brought into life by the growth of the one grain, which signifies resurrection.<p>We were raised up with Christ by His resurrection and in His resurrection. Some may ask how we could have been raised with Christ before we were even born. We should not argue with the Bible. It also tells us that we died with Christ on the cross long before our birth (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20a). With God there is no consideration of time; He considers everything from eternity.<p>As we have seen, 1 Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated by the resurrection of Christ. Second Peter 1:4 goes on to say, “Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature.” By His resurrection, Christ imparted Himself into us not only as our life but with His divine nature. In this way we partake of the divine nature.
