   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>8 Delivered into the Prison of Death</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joseph's betrayal was followed by a period of confinement, a period of imprisonment 39:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Joseph was with two criminals, who typified the two criminals with Christ, one of whom was restored and the other executed 40:1-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It was the same with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After Christ was betrayed, He was put into the prison of death Acts 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was crucified between two criminals, one of whom was saved and the other perished Luke 23:32, 39-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ was confined in the prison of death for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a type of Christ, Joseph had the same experience as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was rejected by his brothers, sold by them, and eventually cast into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ suffered the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Firstly, He was rejected by His brothers; then He was sold by one of His people, and eventually He was cast into the prison of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although Christ was resurrected after His death, His resurrection did not come immediately afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Humanly speaking, the three days of Christ's confinement in the prison of death were not a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No night has ever lasted for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the longest, night lasts from evening until morning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the night Christ spent in the prison of death lasted for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we had been Mary Magdalene, it would have been a long time to us, because she loved Christ, had followed Him, and had seen Him crucified and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After Christ's death and burial, Mary had no heart to eat or sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, she waited for something to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not believe that all the disciples could have forgotten that before His death Christ had said that He would be resurrected after three days.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if they were not clear about what He had said, they must have been impressed with something regarding His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This must have been especially true of the sisters, for they often have a better memory than the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although Peter might not have been impressed with Christ's coming resurrection, I do not believe that Mary Magdalene forgot that Jesus said that after three days He would rise from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was very difficult for her to wait for those three days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It would have been difficult to wait even three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At last, on the third day, the tomb where Jesus was buried was found empty.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The three days and nights that Christ had been confined in the prison of death were a long night.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Joseph's night of confinement lasted approximately ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt, he was about seventeen years of age; and when he was released from prison, he was thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you read the Bible carefully, you will see that it was not long after Joseph was sold to Potiphar that he was cast into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joseph, therefore, was in prison for a long period of time, a long time of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the Bible, it is the young people, not the older ones, who experience this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Joseph was put into prison, he was less than twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every young person needs such a period of confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Young people, because you are so free, you need to be confined.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this country the young people are eager to be eighteen years of age, for then they can be free like birds released from a cage.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have observed this with my own grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the age of eighteen, they think they can be released from the cage.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if the young people love the Lord and are today's Joseph, they will be placed into the Lord's confinement after they have been released from their cage.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Young people, the Lord's confinement is awaiting you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen that Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, before Joseph was enthroned and came into power, he was imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that before enthronement, there is confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Joseph's dreams, there was no indication that he would be imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The dreams must have made Joseph very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In them he saw himself as a standing sheaf and as a shining star.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Joseph was so excited about his dreams that he told his brothers about them, not realizing that they would be offended by them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Enthronement did not immediately follow Joseph's dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, there was betrayal leading to imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After hearing this, some of you may say, "The previous messages on Joseph were wonderful and glorious, but I can't take this word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I quit."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But even if you quit, God will not quit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You need to realize that you are a kite on a string, and that string is in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord would say, "Do you intend to give up?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I will not allow you to give up."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If Joseph had not had those dreams, he probably would not have been in any trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But he had two dreams and in his excitement told his brothers about them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Joseph, however, was not immediately enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, he was depreciated and imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some of the young people may think that if they follow Jesus Christ and are in the Lord's recovery, everything will be glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, the young people need a period of confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is very important for them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>How I thank the Lord for what confinement has done for me!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Your prison may be your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many of you young people were not married when you came into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the church you had the opportunity to make the best selection.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, after the honeymoon, you found that your dear wife became your confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You may say, "What has happened?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now that I am married I am no longer free."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Your husband or wife is your prison.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Every marriage and every home is a prison.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thank the Lord for all these prisons.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As many of us can testify, this confinement lasts a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I have been in this type of prison for a great many years, and because I still need confinement, I am still in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I still have some lessons to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now we come to my burden in this message: I want to share with you, as a parenthetical word, the secret of how to spend your time during your imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the secret of enjoying your imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Without this secret, I could not understand Genesis 40 in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now I would like to present to you the secret of what we should do during our period of imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When the time comes for you to be imprisoned, you will understand that what I am presenting to you in this message is altogether workable.</S>
