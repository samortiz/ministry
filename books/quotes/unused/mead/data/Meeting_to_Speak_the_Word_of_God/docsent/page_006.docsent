   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first point is to burn the incense, that is, to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second point is to light the lamp, that is, to be enlightened by the word in the Bible, or to read the Word.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Chinese version of this hymn, the last phrase of the chorus can also be rendered Always speaking before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, in the Chinese there is a unique rhyme throughout the entire hymn, and if the word praising is changed to speaking, the rhyme is spoiled.</S>
