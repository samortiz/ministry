<h2 class="head1">SEEING OUR LEPROSY</h2>
<p>After Moses saw the vision of the fire burning in the thornbush, God sent him to Pharaoh to lead the Israelites out of Egypt (3:10). Moses, however, was not willing to answer God&rsquo;s call; hence, he said, &ldquo;Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?&rdquo; (v. 11). God then showed Moses three consecutive signs: his staff becoming a serpent, his hand becoming leprous, and water becoming blood (4:1-9). The sign of the staff becoming a serpent was for Moses to know Satan, his hand becoming leprous was for him to know himself, and the water becoming blood was for him to know the world. A person who serves God should have a thorough knowledge concerning Satan, himself, and the world so that he can be useful. If we want to be useful, we must know our condition.</p>
<p>God said to Moses, &ldquo;Put your hand into your bosom,&rdquo; and Moses put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, there his hand was, leprous, as white as snow (v. 6). This enabled Moses to know that he was filled with corruption. There was nothing good in him; he was leprous, utterly filthy. When God asked Moses to put his hand into his bosom, Moses may have thought that he would find a precious treasure. Probably he did not expect that his hand would be full of leprosy. A person who wants to be useful in God&rsquo;s hand needs to know himself; he must see that his natural man is a thornbush and that his self is full of leprosy. Concerning our being used by God, we are a thornbush, and concerning our person, we are corrupt.</p>
<p>For example, if a brother tells you how bad you are, you will get angry even though you may not say anything. But if you have seen the vision of the hand becoming leprous, instead of getting angry, you will say, &ldquo;All this corruption is in me.&rdquo; Rather than getting angry because you are criticized, you will repent because of your corruption. You will say, &ldquo;What this brother has said about me is not even one percent of what I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must remember that our natural man is a thornbush and that we are leprous. When Peter saw that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus spoke of the building up of the church and of the cross (Matt. 16:16, 18, 24). This means that every person who knows Christ and the church must also know himself. To know the self is to accept the experience of the cross. When Peter heard that the Lord was going to be crucified, he immediately said, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (v. 22). But the Lord Jesus &ldquo;turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men. Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&rdquo; (vv. 23-24).</p>
<p>We need to know that everything related to us has been terminated on the cross. However, it will be difficult for us to experience the termination and death of the cross if we do not know our natural man. Only when we know our natural man will we experience the cross. I do not believe that a person can accept the cross without seeing that he is corrupt. Only when we esteem ourselves as lepers will we bow our heads and confess, &ldquo;Not only do I deserve to die; I am already dead!&rdquo; Furthermore, we will accept the death of the cross only when we see that our natural man is a thornbush; that is, our natural insight and natural ability cannot be brought before God.</p>
<p>In order for us to be useful in God&rsquo;s hand, He first deals with us so that we see our natural man and the self. After we are gained by God, He will first show us how useless our natural man is and how corrupt we are. Then we can experience Christ.</p>
