TO KEEP OURSELVES FRESH AND LIVING</h2>
<p>Even the responsible brothers who are taking the lead do not have a consistent exercise of the spirit. We need to pray desperately for this situation because this affects our work with the young people. A brother once asked me what he needed to do in order to keep his spirit fresh and living. The only answer is that we must exercise our spirit. If we do not exercise our spirit, we will become old, but if we learn to exercise our spirit, we will be fresh and living.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to try this: exercise your spirit in every situation, neither exhibiting nor humbling yourself in a conscious manner, forsaking both pride and humility and without any thought of being hidden or manifested in your exercise. Instead, simply exercise your spirit. Try this and see if you become fresh and living. If you exercise in this way, another person may read a verse in a dead and old way, but your reading will be fresh and living. It will be fresh and living because your reading will come out of the exercise of the spirit. When you exercise your spirit, you will be in Christ, and in Christ the old things have passed away and have become new (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>For example, when we are in a meeting and read a verse, we can often sense that some saints are reading in a living way and others are not. This is not merely a matter of tone or emphasis, because even the mimicking of a certain tone cannot eliminate a sense of death. The only thing that matters is whether we are exercising our spirit continually. This is the key to whether or not we are fresh and living. The church is in need of this revolutionary change, but it will not be easy for those who are not accustomed to exercising their spirit. I hope that an atmosphere of exercising the spirit will be gradually cultivated among our young people. The young brothers and sisters should have such an attitude when they come to the meeting; they should not wait for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT AND BEING MOVED<br />
BY THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The concept of waiting to be inspired by the Holy Spirit is not according to the Bible. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Whenever we come together, some will have a song, a teaching, a revelation, and so forth. Brother Nee spent a great deal of time to study this verse in the original Greek language. He discovered that <em>each one has</em> does not mean that each one will have something after arriving at the meeting; rather, it means that each one already has something before coming to the meeting. Hence, having something is not a matter of sudden inspiration in a meeting. Our meeting can be likened to playing a basketball game. The players on the court do not play based on inspiration. They have to be ready to receive the ball whenever it is passed to them and from whatever direction it comes. They cannot say that they will catch the ball when they feel inspired to do so. This is not a proper attitude. However, some saints have this kind of attitude. They care only for the matter of their own inspiration, not for others. Consequently, when everyone is singing a hymn with full enjoyment, they are unmoved and inactive. We should meet in the same way that basketball is played. When the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; comes, we should respond. When a hymn is called, we should follow the movement of the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; and sing. After one offers a prayer, another can strengthen it with a hymn. After singing the hymn, still others can continue to pass the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; with additional prayer. In this way we will be coordinated together. Coordination requires initiative rather than inspiration. Actively exercising our spirit in this way is very different from passively waiting for the Spirit. Actively exercising our spirit is the scriptural way to meet.</p>
<p>In our experience the opening of our mouth is rarely the result of inspiration from the Spirit; rather, it is the result of simply taking the initiative to speak. Often the real move of the Spirit comes only when we open our mouth to speak. Even though some brothers pray only when they are about to give a message, the Spirit still comes when they pray. Similarly, when others bear the responsibility to pray in a meeting, the Spirit comes as soon as they pray. This is an amazing thing. If we bear no responsibility and take no initiative, it seems as if the Spirit does not move, but once we bear some responsibility, the Spirit comes. Is such a result the issue of the movement of the Spirit or of the initiative of the brother? According to our experience, when we take the initiative to serve, rather than waiting passively for the inspiration of the Spirit, the Spirit moves. I believe that we understand this key, but we need to apply it consistently.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEVOTING TIME AND ENERGY<br />
TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT<br />
AND LEARNING TO SPEAK FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>In order to have proper meetings with the young people, we must improve in two areas. First, we must exercise our spirit, and second, we must learn and practice the skills that are needed in order to speak for the Lord. No one can do these two things for us. In regard to our service with the young people, we are not short of material. Furthermore, we have the support of the churches. However, those of us who work with the young people are short in the exercise of the spirit and in the skills needed to speak for the Lord. These two matters are crucial. If we address these two aspects in an adequate way, however, we will be able to achieve something. But if we fail to address these matters, we will not have any results. Hence, we must be trained to exercise our spirit and learn the skills that are needed in order to speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>The important thing in leading the young people&rsquo;s meeting is not the preparation of material, because much material is already available. However, the exercise of the spirit and the skills needed to speak cannot be provided by others. Although two people may use the same material, one may produce a certain kind of flavor, whereas another person will produce a different kind of flavor. The difference in the flavor is determined by the exercise of the spirit and the skills that have been learned. Both aspects require time and energy in order to exercise and learn; no one can do this for us. Even though parents try their best to educate their children, their children must learn to read and write for themselves by devoting time and energy to practice and learn. No one can learn for them. It is not possible to learn merely by watching others; we must practice for ourselves.</p>
<p>I hope that all the saints are clear that leading the young people&rsquo;s meeting requires much more than merely preparing material for them. Both the exercise of the spirit and the skills needed in order to speak for the Lord require time, energy, and practice. There is no shortcut or easy way. Everyone who serves must know how to use his spirit and practice speaking. If we do not practice and learn these two matters, our success will be minimal at best.</p>
<p>In short, with other factors being in place, the key to our success lies in the exercise of the spirit and in the practice of our speaking. If we are willing to exercise our spirit and practice our speaking, the number in the young people&rsquo;s meeting will reach one thousand within a year. It is easy to gain an increase among the young people because every one of them can bring another young person to salvation each year. However, it is not easy for the young ones to lead the ones whom they have gained. If there is a meeting for them, it will be very easy to progress, and many will be saved. It would not be difficult to have a twofold increase in a year, but everything depends upon the amount of time and energy we devote. There are many basketball teams, but when some teams play, no one wants to go to their games, but when other teams play, it is hard to get a ticket to the game. The difference lies in how much effort a team has devoted to advancing. Different efforts will reap different results. We should not overlook the young people&rsquo;s meeting. Rather, we should do a solid and focused work and always make progress. If our work is progressing well, however, we should be wary of becoming proud.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
