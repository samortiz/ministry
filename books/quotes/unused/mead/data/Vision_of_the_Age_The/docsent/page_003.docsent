   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S VISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH AN OUTLINE OF THE OLD TESTAMENT From Adam to Samuel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible has sixty-six books.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Old Testament begins with God s creation, or the creation of Adam, and spans four thousand years until the birth of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first two volumes of Level One of Truth Lessons give us a description and an outline of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The purpose of such a description is to show us the various visions God gave to men throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to see that in every age, God gives only one vision to man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Adam is seen God s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Abel is seen God s way of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Enosh is seen man s need for God and man s calling upon Him to enjoy His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Enoch is seen a redeemed one walking with God on the pathway of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Noah is seen one who walked with God and worked with God to build the ark to meet the need of that generation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in Abraham is seen God s calling, God s promise, justification by faith, the living by faith, and the living in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Isaac is seen the inheriting of grace and the rest and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Jacob is seen God s selection, the transformation in life, and the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Joseph is seen the reigning aspect of the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following this, we see different things in Moses, Aaron, Joshua, and the judges.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Samuel we see the voluntarily consecrated Nazarite replacing the ordained priests, ending the age of the judges, and bringing in the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Acts 13 Paul mentioned this period of history and spoke of God s leading of the Israelites out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through Joshua He led them into the land of Canaan and divided the good land among them for their inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this, He appointed judges from among them until the time of Samuel, at which time He ushered in David.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This period lasted about four hundred fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Way of Reckoning in the Age of the Judges</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to learn to interpret the Bible with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Life-study trainings emphasize life; they do not pay that much attention to history, genealogies, and dates.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the reason that they give detailed explanations of the things of life but spend little time to explain history and dates.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Acts 13:20 Paul says, After these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are at least two or three authoritative interpretations of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is difficult to ascertain the exact number of years in this case.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, since this period of time has much to do with the vision given at that time, we must study the matter in depth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How do these four hundred fifty years come about?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First Kings 6:1 says, Then in the four hundred eightieth year after the children of Israel had come forth out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of his Solomon s reign over Israel...</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Israelites were in the wilderness for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After this, Joshua led for twenty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then there was the time of the judges, which lasted until the time of Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The four hundred fifty years that Paul speaks of in Acts 13:20 surely include all these events.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>David s reign lasted forty years, and afterward there was the reign of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we add up these numbers, we can see one thing: Paul s word in Acts 13 does not take Saul s years into account because at the time he was king, there was a rival, which was David.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can say that during that period of time there was no properly appointed king from God to unite the whole nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Strictly speaking, before the Israelites were united as one nation, they were still in the age of the judges.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Saul was appointed by God to be king, in God s eyes his words did not count; only Samuel s words counted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Samuel held the positions of both a prophet and a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time, outwardly Saul was king, but in reality, in God s eyes, Samuel was still functioning as a judge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As for David, he was anointed early on, but at the beginning it was neither his words nor Saul s words that counted, but Samuel s words.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even after David became king, his first seven and a half years are not reckoned in Paul s word concerning four hundred fifty years because at that time the house of Saul was not yet removed; Saul s son Ish-bosheth was still king in Mahanaim 2 Sam 2:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the eyes of God, that was still the age of the judges.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Based on the above, we can make a clear conclusion: The age of the judges was terminated only after David became king over all of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>David unified the entire nation of Israel and was officially recognized as king in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After this, there was no more confusion or disturbance in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This lasted for thirty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to 1 Kings 6:1, from the time of the exodus to the fourth year of Solomon were four hundred eighty years.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Subtracting from that the last thirty-three years of David s reign and the first three years of Solomon s reign, we have four hundred forty-four years left.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This somewhat matches Paul s word in Acts 13:20: For about four hundred and fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The difference between the two is only six years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the reason that Paul uses the word about.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Within the period of the time of the judges, which lasted approximately four hundred fifty years, was the reign of Saul, which lasted forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But God did not recognize him as king.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The reason for this is that he did not serve as king according to a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Samuel, on the other hand, was recognized as a judge because he served with a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This can be proven by the fact that the age of the judges did not end until the termination of the ministry of Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Of course, the final termination of the age of the judges began with the reign of David in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The period of proper kingship does not include the first seven and a half years of David s reign.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In God s eyes, the throne was empty at that time because there were still contenders for the throne, and the nation was under the turmoil of war.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>During those seven and a half years, the Israelites did not serve according to a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although both Saul and David during his first seven and a half years of reign were kings, the only one who served according to a vision was Samuel, who served as a judge.</S>
