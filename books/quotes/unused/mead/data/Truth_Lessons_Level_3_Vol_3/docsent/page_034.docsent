   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning Righteousness in Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because the Son Goes to the Father</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in Resurrection and Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In John 16:10 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit will convict the world concerning righteousness: Because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me. Righteousness is the resurrected Christ 1 Cor 1:30 . Christ the Son in resurrection went to the Father in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a strong sign that Christ has accomplished God s redemption and that His redemption has been accepted by God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we believe into Christ, we receive God s righteousness in Christ, and this righteousness is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through this righteousness we are justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s Son, having fulfilled the righteous requirements of the Father and having been accepted by Him, was given to the believers to be our righteousness; in Him we are justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning Judgment in Satan,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the Ruler of This World</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Has Been Judged</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally, the Spirit of reality convicts the world concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged John 16:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Through the death of Christ on the cross, Satan, the ruler of this world, has been judged 12:31-33; 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the judgment in 16:11 is related to Satan, the devil, the author of sin, the origin of death, the father of sinners, and the ruler of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The lake of fire is prepared for God s judgment upon Satan; the lake of fire is not intended for human beings, but those who refuse to be transferred from Adam into Christ will share in the judgment upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that all those who do not believe into the Son will be with Satan, sharing his judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God loves the world 3:16 , and He has no intention of casting man into the lake of fire; this judgment is for the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if a person refuses to believe in the Son and remains a companion to Satan, then God has no choice but to allow him to suffer Satan s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The three major items in John 16:8-11 are related to Adam, Christ, and Satan: sin is related to Adam, righteousness to Christ, and judgment to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were born in Adam, but we believed into Christ and have received Him as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, those who do not believe into Christ and remain followers of Satan will share in the judgment upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit came to convict us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who have repented and believed into the Lord Jesus have escaped the judgment upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have been transferred out of Adam into Christ to become the children of God and the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are Christ s members, living in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participating in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. Being Born as a Newborn Child</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The believers also live in the organism of the Divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity by being born as a newborn child vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In His resurrection Christ gave birth to a corporate child the corporate new man with Himself as the firstborn Son of God and His many brothers as the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verses 20 and 21 the Lord Jesus said, Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her hour has come; but when she brings forth the little child, she no longer remembers the affliction because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the Lord indicated that the disciples were like a woman travailing in birth and that He was the child to be brought forth in resurrection Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5; Rom 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Actually, the child in John 16:21 is a corporate man, comprising Christ and all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The birth accomplished by Christ was not merely an individual birth but also a corporate birth, which includes the firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Through this one birth, many sons were born.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All God s chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This resurrection was the birth of a corporate child.</S>
