   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX MAN, SINNER, SIN, AND SINS Time: Spring 1937</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Canton</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Editor's Note: In the spring of 1937, Brother Nee conducted two studies on "The Gospel of God" in Shanghai and Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Shanghai messages have been published as The Gospel of God Volumes 28 and 29 of The Collected Works.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The following two chapters are based on the Canton messages, and they are similar in content to the first two chapters of The Gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The dates of these articles are not known.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Tonight I am not here to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, I am here to teach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Bible, there is gospel preaching and there is also gospel teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to teach the gospel because many have become Christians, yet they do not know how they became Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christians know that they have entered the gate, but they do not know how they entered the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The message tonight is for those who have entered the gate; it is to show them what the gospel is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we are not standing at the entrance compelling or inviting people to come in. We are speaking only to those who have already entered the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We want to speak concerning how you have become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I will not be doing a gospel preaching work; rather, I will do a gospel teaching work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I will not persuade or encourage you to believe the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I only want to tell you how you have obtained the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just like an instructor who shows his students a map, I will tell you the way that you have come to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The gospel concerns how God saved us, that is, how we entered the gate of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Tonight we are not in any hurry.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would rather speak slowly so that you may know more about the truths of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By the grace of God, I want to speak to you concerning the subject of man, sinner, sin, and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Tomorrow evening perhaps we can speak about God's love, grace, righteousness, etc. What I am going to speak tonight may not be so pleasant for the ear because people dislike these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>MAN AND SINNER</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Genesis God made Adam, that is, man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Adam was the first man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, his wife, Eve, was not the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eve was just a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even in committing sins, Eve was still a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible does not say that Eve sinned independently.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only 1 Timothy 2:14 speaks of Eve's transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Other than that instance, the Bible says that Adam was the first man who sinned; only the one man Adam sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eve was taken out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since Eve was taken out of Adam, she can be considered as a part of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From God's viewpoint, there was no way for Eve to exist independently by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We know that we sin because we were born of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to God, we are all sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Unlike Adam who became a sinner because he sinned, we sin because we were born sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a big difference between Adam and all other men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Adam became a sinner because he sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we sin because we first are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man did not become a sinner because of his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if a man did not sin, he would still be a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The moment a person is born, he is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, man is born a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I was speaking in Kaifeng, someone asked me, "How can we be in Adam?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I said to him, "The Chinese say that they are the descendants of Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Hwang-ti was fighting with Tzi-you, suppose that Hwang-ti had not killed Tzi-you, but that Tzi-you had shot Hwang-ti with an arrow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Where would you be today?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He said, "Definitely, I would not be here."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I said, "What does Hwang-ti's death have to do with your existence?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said, "If Hwang-ti died, all of his descendants would not have lived, because we all came out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because there was a Hwang-ti, we are here.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without him, we would not be here."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I said, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the same as man's existence in Adam."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We came out of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because Adam was a sinner, those who are in Adam are also sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose you go to a plant nursery to buy a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Later, this peach tree bears many peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you have bought a good peach tree, it will bear good peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you have bought a bad peach tree, it will bear bad peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sinners are just like trees.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sins committed by the sinners can be likened to the fruit of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A certain kind of tree will bear a certain kind of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The question is which kind are you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The fruit you bear will be according to the kind you are.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You sin as a result of being a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You do not become a sinner because you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the fundamental concept of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What you are is far more important than what you do.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Adam became a sinner because of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But we sin because we are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There are two kinds of sinners in this world: One is the sinner who sins, and the other is the sinner who does not sin, or the moral sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whether or not man sins, he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For example, man has the ability to speak, but there are some namely, those who are dumb who cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, just because a person cannot speak does not mean that he is not a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We can only say that he is a dumb person.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Those who can speak are human beings; those who cannot speak are also human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There are some sinners who sin, and there are some sinners who are moral.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It does not matter who you are.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You have always been a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is why all men need a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Many compare themselves with others and congratulate themselves for not sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But in God's eyes, they are only sinners who have not committed a certain kind of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some may think that since they have committed only a few sins, they do not need the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But in God's eyes, they are still sinners; they are just sinners who have committed a few sins.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even if you think that you are moral and have high ethical standards, and that you are very humble and gentle, at most God would consider you to be a very humble sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You are still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You still need the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the book of Romans, there are only two verses prior to 5:19 which use the word sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>They are 3:7 and 5:8.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Romans frequently mentions the many sins of man, but it does not say that man has become a sinner because of the many sins he has committed.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is only one place in the Bible that tells us how man became a sinner, or what constitutes man a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Romans 5:19 says, "Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The one man who disobeyed was Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Many were constituted sinners through his disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Man's sins have not made him a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>All those who have been born of Adam are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>One time I was teaching a group of elementary students in a Sunday school class.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I did not know what to say, and I first asked them what kind of people are sinners, that is, who are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>A little girl answered, "Those who sin are sinners."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Many who are here tonight are much older than that little girl, but many may think the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is childish thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Bible says that as long as one is a man he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Adam became a sinner because of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But we who came out of Adam are sinners whether or not we have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Ordinarily, a peach tree bears fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>But there are exceptions.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Perhaps among one or two million peach trees, there are a few which do not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Although these trees do not bear fruit, they are still peach trees.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Likewise, there may be one or two men among millions who do not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Although they do not sin, they are still sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In the seventeen years that I have been preaching, I have never said, "If you do not sin, God will be pleased with you."</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>God abhors sin, and because every man is a sinner and has committed sin, God also abhors the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Romans 1 through 8 specifically speaks of how man is a sinner and how he receives salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Every Christian should come up to the standard of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If you do not understand the book of Romans, you cannot be a good Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Only those who understand the book of Romans can understand God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Romans 5 is a chapter that deals particularly with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The sin spoken of in Romans 5 is the result of man becoming a sinner, that is, man sins because he is already a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Man first has the sinful life, and then he lives a sinful living.</S>
