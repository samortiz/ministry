        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRIESTLY SERVICE AND<br />
THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Zech. 6:12-13; 1 Pet. 2:4-5; Rev. 5:9-10; 1 Cor. 14:1; Exo. 27:20-21; 30:6-8</h1>
<p>Zechariah 6:12-13 says, &ldquo;Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Here is a man, whose name is the Shoot; and he will shoot forth from his place and will build the temple of Jehovah. Indeed, it is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.&rdquo; This is a prophecy of the Lord Jesus building the temple of God. <em>Shoot</em> denotes the Lord Jesus. According to the flesh, the Lord is out of David; He is the Shoot growing out of David (Jer. 23:5). As the Shoot, He will build the temple of Jehovah and bear the majesty associated with building the temple of God. He will reign as a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the priesthood and the kingship. These are extraordinary verses; it is the only place in the Bible that speaks of the combination of the priesthood and the kingship in the Lord Jesus for the building of the temple of God.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone,...you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.&rdquo; The kingship and the priesthood are combined in the term <em>royal priesthood.</em> This shows that both offices are combined in the saints, just as they were combined in the Lord Jesus. The combination of these offices in the saints is for the building of a spiritual house, which is the holy priesthood. Revelation 5:9-10 speaks of Christ&rsquo;s death and of the saints being priests and kings, saying, &ldquo;You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth.&rdquo; In these verses the kingship and priesthood are combined in the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
PRIESTS, KINGS, AND PROPHETS</h2>
<p>In the Bible the service of God&rsquo;s people is carried out by the offices of the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood. Priests fellowship with God, kings reign for God, and prophets speak for God. The priesthood and the kingship are permanently and indispensably linked with each other. However, the prophethood is primarily supplemental. When the priesthood and kingship are functioning properly, there is no need for prophets. Prophets are needed only when kings fail and priests fall short. Hence, the prophethood should not be considered as a permanent office.</p>
<p>The two most prominent prophets in the history of Israel were Elijah and Elisha, who arose at the height of Israel&rsquo;s desolation. At that time, Ahab, who was the king of Israel, &ldquo;did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah, more than all who were before him&rdquo; (1 Kings 16:30). Similarly, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, allied himself in marriage with the house of Ahab (2 Chron. 18:1). Elijah and Elisha held prominent positions as prophets because the kings were in a poor condition, and the priests were not ministering properly.</p>
<p>The New Testament extensively speaks of the Lord as King and Priest but not so extensively as Prophet. For example, the Gospel of Matthew speaks of the Lord Jesus as a King, and the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the Lord Jesus as a High Priest. However, there is no book devoted to the Lord Jesus as a Prophet. There are some verses that indicate the prophethood of the Lord Jesus, such as Acts 3:22-23, which refers to Deuteronomy 18:15 and 18 through 19, saying that God will raise up a Prophet from the midst of Israel. Even in the prophecy concerning the Lord&rsquo;s building of the temple in Zechariah 6:12-13, only the priesthood and the kingship are mentioned, not the prophethood. When the function of the priests and kings is normal, the function of the prophets is not prominent.</p>
<p>Every believer is a priest to fellowship with God and a king to reign with the Lord (Rev. 5:9-10). We are royal priests (1 Pet. 2:9). In contrast, the Bible does not speak of all the believers as being prophets; rather, it says that we should desire earnestly to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:1). Although God&rsquo;s children may not all function as prophets, they all are kings and priests and must function as priests and kings. It is only when the priesthood and kingship are weak, failing, and desolate that prophets emerge.</p>
<p>We have a serious lack in our service today. Although a few are ministering the word as prophets, it is hard for the saints to function according to the priesthood and kingship. Furthermore, there is almost a complete reliance upon preachers in Christianity. This shows that the priesthood and the kingship have been neglected. If this condition is not corrected, there will be no way to carry out God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, everyone in the church should function as a priest and king. Every saint should fellowship with God, burn the incense, and light the lamps before God so that the fragrance of Christ would be rich, and the light in the Word would be bright. Furthermore, the saints should be full of God&rsquo;s authority to reign for God. Regrettably, God&rsquo;s children have neglected these two offices. Relying on prophets deviates from the normal way and leads to desolation. A church in a locality may have a few particularly strong ministers of the word, but if the condition of the priesthood and kingship among the saints is weak, very little building can occur because the situation is abnormal. When believers focus on preaching and depend upon preaching, the condition of a church is one of degradation. Prophets were raised up in the Old Testament only when God&rsquo;s people were desolate, when the kings neglected their duties, and when the priests were absent in their function. The establishment of seminaries to train a minority of believers to be pastors and ministers speaks of the desolate condition of God&rsquo;s people.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
