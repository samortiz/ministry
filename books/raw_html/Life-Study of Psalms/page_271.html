<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. CHRIST REIGNING,<br>AND THE EARTH BEING GLAD AND REJOICING</H2><P>According to Psalm 97:1-2, 4-6, 8-9, and 11 Christ will reign, and the earth will be glad and rejoicing. Today the earth is not pleasant, and thus the inhabitants of the earth are not glad. But when Christ reigns, the earth will be glad and will rejoice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH<br>HAVING SEEN THE SALVATION OF GOD</H2><P>Psalm 98 declares that all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of God. Verses 2 and 3 say, "Jehovah has made His salvation known;/In the sight of the nations/He has revealed His righteousness./He remembered His lovingkindness and His faithfulness/Toward the house of Israel;/All the ends of the earth have seen/The salvation of our God." The whole earth has seen God's salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. CHRIST REIGNING IN ZION<br>AND THE PEOPLES TREMBLING</H2><P>Psalm 99 speaks of Christ reigning in Zion and of all the peoples trembling. Today the nations around Israel are trying to destroy her. But when Christ reigns in Zion, all the nations around Zion will tremble (vv. 1-2, 4, 9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XI. ALL THE EARTH MAKING<br>A JOYFUL NOISE TO CHRIST</H2><P>Psalm 100 opens with a charge to all the earth: "Make a joyful sound to Jehovah, all the earth" (v. 1). As Darby points out in a footnote in his translation of the Bible, the Hebrew word translated "joyful sound" here can also be rendered "joyful noise." When we are joyful we will shout, and to shout is surely to make a noise. Sometimes in our meetings we should make a joyful noise to the Lord, praising Him and shouting "Hallelujah!" This will make the Lord happy, and it will put the devil and the demons to shame. When we are silent, we are deadened, but when we praise the Lord with a joyful noise, we are strengthened.</P>
