<h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>[Since the church is the assembly called out by God from the world, it should meet continually. Meetings enable God’s called out congregation to be supplied, established, and perfected, that the goal of God’s calling this assembly may be accomplished.] Meetings are actually the practical expression of a local church. A local church without meetings is not a church. Meetings supply the saints with the Spirit, teach the saints with the Word, and keep the saints in the fellowship of the Triune God. Meetings express the fullness of the Triune God. Meetings defeat the enemy. Meetings save sinners. Meetings build up the church. Meetings are crucial and necessary. Without the meetings, a church cannot go on and will not arrive at the goal of being built up.<h2 class=head1>I. THE CHURCH MEETINGS ARE ORDAINED BY GOD FOR THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>Hebrew 10:25 says, “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together.’’ [Here the assembling of ourselves together refers to our Christian meetings. God has ordained the way in which every living thing in the universe should exist. God’s ordination is the very law by which a particular living thing lives. If the living thing obeys that law, it will survive and be blessed. God is the same towards us who have believed in Christ. God’s ordination for us, which becomes our law of existence and blessing, is the meetings. As water is to the fish, and air to the birds, so are the meetings to the Christians. As the fish must live in the water and the birds must exist in the air, so the Christians must maintain their spiritual existence and living by the meetings.]<h2 class=head1>II. THE BELIEVERS ARE A MEETING PEOPLE</h2><p>[Every kind of life has its own characteristic, and usually, many characteristics. The spiritual life we believers have received, being the life of God in us, also possesses many characteristics. For example, the hatred for sin and the separation from sin are characteristics of this life. The desire to draw near to God and the willingness to serve Him are also its characteristics. One of the many characteristics of our spiritual life is to flock together, to meet together. John 10:3 and 16 show us that since we are saved, we are the Lord’s sheep. The characteristic of the sheep’s life is to flock together and to dislike isolation from the other sheep. Hence, the Bible says that we are not only the Lord’s sheep, but even more, His flock (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2). In order to be a sheep which shares in the blessing of the flock, we must meet together with the flock. The characteristic of the spiritual “sheep life’’ within us requires this of us.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE PURPOSE OF THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2><p>The purpose of the church meetings is multifaceted. First, the meetings are to remember the Lord and to worship the Father. When the Lord established His supper (Luke 22:7-23), He said that we should do this in remembrance of Him. After the supper they sang a hymn (Matt. 26:30). According to Hebrew 2:12, the Lord may have sung a hymn of praise to the Father with His disciples. Second, the church meetings are for prayer. The Lord said that the church has the authority to bind and to loose what has been bound and loosed in heaven (Matt. 16:19; 18:18-19). This indicates that the church should get together to pray. The church began with prayer (Acts 1:14) and continued in prayer (Acts 2:42). Third, the church meetings are for preaching the gospel to save sinners. The disciples preached the gospel in the temple and from house to house (Acts 5:42). Fourth, the church meetings afford the believers an opportunity to care for one another in love (1 Thes. 4:9) and to grow in life (John 21:15-17). Fifth, the meetings are for teaching the truth to perfect one another (Acts 20:20). Finally, the meetings are for building up the church (1 Cor. 14:26). After seeing the purpose of the church meetings, we should meet as much as possible. Even meeting everyday is not too much.
