   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Young Saints Preaching with Power</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps you would say, "Brother Lee, you have been in the Word for over fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can we be powerful in preaching the gospel if we are still young in the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let me testify to you that even when I was young my speaking was powerful because of these three matters of prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that even the young saints can preach the gospel with power and impact if they trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Young saints, you can take a portion of the Word and preach it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only do not trust in any eloquence you might have.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who are eloquent in speaking may not have any power or impact.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But those who are not eloquent, and who may even mispronounce words, may have impact and power in their gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we trust in prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, the Lord may even use speaking with the wrong pronunciation of words to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SPEAKING CHRIST A. To All Our Relatives</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Dear saints, now we are in the Lord's recovery and I do believe that now is the time for the Lord to carry out His up-to-date move.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All of us in the Lord's recovery have to speak Christ in our daily life to our parents, our children, our cousins, and our in-laws.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all owe so much to our relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Try to write a list of all the names of your relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among these names maybe twenty percent are saved, and the rest are remaining in unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They need your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of your relatives need the real help rendered by your speaking of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not preach in a religious way, but speak Christ to your relatives in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Speak to your father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Speak to your mother.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Speak to your aunt.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Speak to your uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Speak to your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if both you and your brother are Christians, you still need to speak one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let your parents hear your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not talk about computers, physics, or mathematics, but only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the unique treasure!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Speak about Jesus, Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the all-inclusive, processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your parents would marvel at such a speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. To Everyone, Everywhere</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Continue to speak Christ every day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All human beings today need Christ, yet we need to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Speak in a living way, in a practical way, according to your experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Speak at your school, in your office, at the coffee break, at your lunch break, at least five minutes every day, five days a week, four weeks a month.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At least twenty times monthly you could speak Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We believe that today the Lord is the processed Spirit who dwells in us and also upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It does not matter whether this Spirit is sensed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We believe that while we are serving Him and speaking for Him, especially as we are speaking Him forth, He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have the Lord's presence within us as the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through prayer, the Word, and the Spirit, we can have true power and impact.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would be faithful to speak in this way, surely many of our dear friends and relatives would be brought to the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To speak we need to have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit is within us and upon us, and so we simply need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We get the Spirit through prayer.</S>
