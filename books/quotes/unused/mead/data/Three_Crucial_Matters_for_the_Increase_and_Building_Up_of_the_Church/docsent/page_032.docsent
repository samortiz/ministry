   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHANGING THE SYSTEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENABLING EVERYONE TO FUNCTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before we began to change the system, our condition was only slightly different from that of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We had a weekly big meeting in which a brother released a message and the saints listened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We did not refer to the brother as a preacher; rather, we referred to him as a speaking brother, as one who speaks from the platform, or as one who ministers the word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was not referred to as a preacher, but he functioned as a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though our messages had some light, life, and truth in them and were somewhat higher than what was preached in Christianity, we maintained the abnormal condition of one person speaking and everyone else listening.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When people only listen, they do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The saints were unable to lead home meetings, because they only listened to messages for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This can be compared to a housewife who does not know how to cook because for many years she has been eating food prepared by others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This proves that our old system did not build up the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the few speaking brothers are absent, the saints cannot prepare their own meals.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sister Lee takes care of everything concerning what I eat and drink; consequently, I do not know how to do anything in the kitchen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, the pastors in Christianity and the speaking brothers among us have created a situation in which no one else can speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, we must change the system.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We cannot allow this situation to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whether or not we know how to cook, we must all rise up and cook.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It does not matter whether we make mistakes; eventually, we will prepare a delicious meal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not be set in our concepts and think that it is normal for only one person to speak while everyone else merely listens.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also should not receive this speaking as if it were merely another message to listen to.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need a change in our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are changing the system so that everyone will give themselves to prepare meals.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who know how to cook should cook, and those who do not know how to cook should also cook.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the food is burned, we can eat it, and if the food is not done, we can still eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we will practice for at least six months, the meals we prepare will be delicious.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>DOOR-KNOCKING BEING TO MAKE PROFIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>AND HOME MEETINGS BEING TO GIVE PEOPLE FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The record in the Bible is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Two thousand years ago the Lord taught His disciples the things that we need to pay attention to today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to knock on doors and we need to have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The purpose of door-knocking is to make a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we gain many sons of peace, we make a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord condemns the evil and slothful slave in Matthew 25 because he did not make any profit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The evil and slothful slave said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow v. 24 . When we are in the Lord s work, the Lord requires us to do what we are unable to do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this sense, the Lord is a hard man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The evil and slothful slave said that the master was hard, and the master did not deny this word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, he seemed to respond, You are right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since you know that I am like this, you should have made a profit with the money you received.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word is not a small admonishment; rather, this is a serious command and a strict warning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day the Lord will return, and He will settle accounts with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He will ask what profit we earned with the talent He gave us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through door-knocking we can make a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before we changed the system, most of us had not made any profit, but now everyone who goes door-knocking can make a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From this we can see the need to change the system.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, we must care for the sons of peace who are gained through door-knocking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the Lord says, Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>24:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can faithfully give food at the proper time in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we must all learn how to prepare food and give it to the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>HOW TO USE LIFE LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to use Life Lessons in the home meetings, we must have an understanding of the lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The title of the first lesson is Knowing That You Are Saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After reading the title, we should read the outline.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first point in the outline is on the significance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The second point is concerning the proofs of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This includes the outward proof, the inward proof, and the proof of love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The outward proof is by the word of the Bible, the inward proof is by the Holy Spirit in our spirit, and the proof of love is that we love God s children because we have experienced the eternal life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We love the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This threefold proof gives us the assurance that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to know this general outline so that we can speak with others according to the outline.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we teach the first lesson, we should let people know that salvation refers to a person s being saved before God, which includes being forgiven of sins, being spared from perdition, being regenerated, having the eternal life of God, and becoming a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should not fear repeating this, because the new believers need to know it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should even use pray-reading to apply these words to the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should speak concerning the outward proof and say that this proof is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we should lead the new ones to pray-read the verses quoted in Life Lessons so that the new ones may know the verses.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should also speak of the inward proof and say that God has given us the Holy Spirit who witnesses within our spirit that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we simply speak the points, it will be a great help to the new believers.</S>
