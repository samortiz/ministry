<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Satanic Chaos with the Romans,<br>the Jews, and the Followers of Christ</H2><P>All these wonderful things in the divine economy were accompanied by something evil, the satanic chaos.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Herod Seeking to Kill Christ in His Babyhood</H2><P>According to Matthew 2:1-22 Herod sought to kill Christ in His babyhood.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Pharisees Criticizing and Blaspheming Christ</H2><P>As Christ was carrying out His ministry in the divine economy, the Pharisees criticized and blasphemed Him (Matt. 9:10-13, 33-34; 12:22-35).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The People of Israel Rejecting Christ<br>and His Teaching</H2><P>The people of Israel rejected Christ and His teaching (Matt. 11:20-24; 13:53-58).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Pharisees and Sadducees Tempting Christ<br>and Instructing People with Teachings of Leaven</H2><P>The Pharisees and Sadducees tempted Christ and instructed people with teachings of leaven (Matt. 16:1-12). For this reason, He said to His disciples, "Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" (v. 6), and eventually they understood that by leaven He meant the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees (v. 12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Satan Moving in Peter to Frustrate Christ<br>from Carrying Out His Crucifixion</H2><P>Satan moved in Peter to frustrate Christ from carrying out His crucifixion (Matt. 16:21-26). When the Lord Jesus revealed to His disciples that He would be crucified, Peter, showing his love for the Lord, "took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!" (v. 22). When Peter said this, the Lord Jesus turned and said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men" (v. 23). Apparently Peter was being very loving toward the Lord; actually he was motivated by Satan. This means that even Peter's love for the Lord Jesus was instigated by Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Followers of Christ<br>Contending with One Another to Be Great</H2><P>The followers of Christ contended with one another to be great (Luke 22:24; Matt. 20:21-27). While the Lord Jesus was expecting soon to be crucified, His followers were fighting with one another about who would be first among them. They had heard many things about the heavenly kingdom, but instead of caring about those things, they cared about being great. Their contending with one another to be great must have been instigated by Satan.</P>
