<p>Now we come to the last book of the Bible, Revelation. Verses 7 and 8 of chapter 19 say, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&rdquo; These verses speak of the coming marriage of the Lamb, when His wife, the bride, has made herself ready. Strictly speaking, doctrinally speaking, that will be the fulfillment of prophecy, but this fulfillment is still not here. So these verses indicate that a prophecy is going to be fulfilled. This prophecy is that the bride of Christ will be made ready. We need to be impressed that there is a great prophecy in the Bible regarding the building up of the church and the preparation of Christ&rsquo;s bride.</p>
<p>Now we have to ask when this great prophecy concerning the church will be fulfilled. We may have been in the church life for many years and still not know when this prophecy will be fulfilled. We all have to declare, &ldquo;Now! Now is the time!&rdquo; Then we need to know how it will be fulfilled. It can be fulfilled by our eating Christ as our spiritual food (John 6:57). We all have to say, &ldquo;Now is the time, and eating is the way.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENTS OF THIS GREAT PROPHECY</h2>
<p>We need to see the contents of this great prophecy. Although the verses that we have pointed out may be familiar to us, we may overlook all the points covered in such a great prophecy. In Matthew 16:18 the Lord first said to Peter, &ldquo;I also say to you...&rdquo; He said this to Peter because Peter had already seen something. None of the other disciples had seen what he had seen. When Jesus asked them who men said that the Son of Man was, they answered by saying that some said He was John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets (v. 14). But when the Lord asked them who they said that He was, only Peter responded. He declared that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God (vv. 15-16). The Lord then told Peter, &ldquo;Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens. And I also say to you...&rdquo; (vv. 17-18a). Just to know Christ is insufficient and inadequate. The Lord was telling Peter that he needed to see something more.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (v. 18). <em>Peter</em> means &ldquo;a stone.&rdquo; For the building up of the church, there is the need of living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). The first time Peter was brought to the Lord by his brother Andrew, the Lord Jesus immediately gave him a new name. He said, &ldquo;You shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, Peter)&rdquo; (John 1:42). At one time we were pieces of clay. But Jesus told Peter, &ldquo;You are a stone, and I am the rock. I am the foundation stone, and you are a piece of stone for the building up of the church. The gates of Hades shall not prevail against this church that I will build.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have to consider ourselves in the light of what the Lord said. We have to ask ourselves if we are stones. Actually, some of the young brothers are fifty percent stone and fifty percent clay. They become &ldquo;muddy&rdquo; easily. Regardless of how much water you pour on a piece of stone, it still remains solid. But if you pour water on a piece of clay, it becomes muddy. If we are stones, we have to ask, &ldquo;Where is the building up?&rdquo; Piling many pieces of stone together does not make a building. Is there a real building among us? If you feel that there is some friction between you and some other saints in the church, that means you have not been built in. Once a piece of stone has been built in, there is no friction. To be built into the church, God&rsquo;s building, is our destiny and even our destination for eternity.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;I will build.&rdquo; But some Christian teachers like to evade such a word. They say that there is no possibility for us Christians to be built up today in this age. To them the Lord is not able in this age; He is able only in the coming age. To them the Lord is not able on this earth; He is able only when we get into heaven. They say that one day we will be built up but not today on this earth. But the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 16:18 is not a prophecy that will be fulfilled in the next age and in heaven. Now is the time for the church to be built. We are living stones, and the Lord wants to use us as the material for His building. But we have to ask, &ldquo;Have we been built up with others?&rdquo; In his first Epistle, Peter said, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house&rdquo; (2:5). This is all that we need today.</p>
<p>The power of darkness cannot prevail against the built-up church. Look at today&rsquo;s situation among all the Christians. It seems that nearly everywhere the enemy, the power of darkness, is prevailing. In every direction Christianity has been defeated. The gates of Hades have been and still are so prevailing against today&rsquo;s Christianity because there is no building. It is only the built-up church, the church that has been built up by Christ, against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail. We cannot see such a thing today. We are still desiring to see the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy for a built-up church.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4 Paul said, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith&rdquo; (v. 13a). The oneness of the faith is not the oneness of doctrines. Only the Lord Jesus, His person, and His redemptive work are the constituents of our faith. If we have this, we are saved. If we do not have this, we are lost. But this is not the case with doctrines. Whether or not you have the doctrine of absolute grace, foot-washing, head covering, or baptism by immersion does not affect your salvation. The Quakers do not practice water baptism, but many of them are saved. However, they could never be saved without having the faith that Jesus is the divine person, the Son of God, incarnated to be a man, who was crucified on the cross for our sins and resurrected on the third day. He is the Lord and our Redeemer, who has redeemed us by shedding His blood. Without believing into Christ as the divine and human person with His redeeming blood, we could never be saved. This is our faith. Regretfully, Christians today are divided not by their faith but by different doctrines.</p>
<p>Just with the matter of the rapture, there are many different doctrinal interpretations, such as pretribulation, posttribulation, midtribulation, and partial rapture. Regardless of what kind of rapture you believe in, as long as you have the faith in Christ, you are a saved one. Do we still hold on to some doctrine? Is pray-reading our doctrine? By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I do not hold on to any doctrine. We are not on the way of arriving at the oneness of doctrines but at the oneness of the faith, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we would be no longer children who are tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine. With us there should be no more carrying about. We should hold on only to the faith. Christians are divided because they are for different doctrines. They have been stopped by their doctrines, so they have to go on. They need to go on by leaving the doctrines until they arrive at the oneness of the faith.</p>
<p>Some who hold on to baptism by immersion have become the Southern Baptist Church. Another group of believers hold on to speaking in tongues, so they become a tongue-speaking church. Others who hold on to foot-washing become a foot-washing group. Still others hold on to the doctrine of the presbytery, so they are the Presbyterian Church. All these brothers are divided because of the different doctrines they hold on to. We need to drop all the doctrines and go on to arrive at the oneness of the faith. We do not care for any doctrine, although we have the proper doctrines. We have elders and practice baptism by immersion, but we do not hold on to these doctrines. The believers are scattered and divided by doctrines. They are being carried about by every wind of doctrine. We have left the position of division by doctrines to arrive at the oneness of the faith.</p>
<p>We also have to arrive at a full-grown man and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Then we will be normal children. We will grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things. Then out of Him, the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body through every joint of the rich supply and through the effectual working of every part.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5 there is the sanctifying and purifying with the living water in the word to wash away all the spots and wrinkles that the church might be glorious. Some day the church will be presented to Christ in such a glorious situation. At that time the church will be ready. This is a prophecy.</p>
<p>Of course, whatever the Lord has prophesied will surely be fulfilled. He can never be defeated. Since the Lord has prophesied that He will build His church, this prophecy will be fulfilled. Without the fulfillment of this prophecy, there is no way for the Lord to come back. If the church were not built, this would be a shame to Him. Satan would be able to say, &ldquo;You have prophesied concerning the building up of the church, yet You have not been able to fulfill it.&rdquo; I have the full assurance, however, that the Lord is going to fulfill whatever He has prophesied so that He may come back. Before His coming back, He may boast to Satan by saying, &ldquo;Satan, whatever I have prophesied, I have fulfilled, so I am coming!&rdquo; The fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy concerning the building up of the church will bring Him back. Now is the time for the Lord to fulfill His prophecy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
