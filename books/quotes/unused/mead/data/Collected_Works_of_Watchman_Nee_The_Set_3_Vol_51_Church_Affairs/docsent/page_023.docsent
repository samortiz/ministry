   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY OF SERVICE Not Preferring a Message on the Lord's Day</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers, I do not know if you have ever thought about this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I desire very much to have a heart-to-heart talk with you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Have you seen that Protestantism today emphasizes the messages on Sunday?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I feel that this is the problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that you can have a thorough consideration these days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you want merely to maintain a Lord's Day morning message meeting on the surface?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Next year when I go to Tsingtao, Canton, or Peking, I would rather see no messages given on Sunday morning, but rather see each and every brother in Peking serving and each and every brother busy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the preaching of the gospel, everyone would be there preaching; during the time for taking care of people, everyone would be there taking care of people; during the time of harvest, everyone would be there harvesting; after the harvest, everyone would be there caring for others; when there are matters needing responsibility, there would be brothers there bearing the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I would say that this is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If in a locality there is a very strong Lord's Day morning message meeting, but it is without the service of each and every brother, that is not the church; that is Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If among us there are four, five, or ten brothers doing well while the rest are immobile, what we have is the priestly system of Catholicism and the pastoral system of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No Inactive Members</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church in the Bible is a church that preaches the gospel, a church that visits people, and a church that cares for others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is the Body of Christ in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Body there are no inactive members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If one day there could be a group of brothers or even a whole church in which everyone serves, everyone carries out spiritual matters properly, everyone bears responsibility, and everyone is busy, then that would be the true Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Service of the Church Being Our Way Today</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our way today is different than before.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should not consider ourselves to be proper simply because we have done much work and have had many experiences in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we have turned around completely.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not recognize Catholicism!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not recognize Protestantism!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way of Catholicism and Protestantism is absolutely different from our way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our way is the service of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope you brothers will pay special attention to this matter because when you go to work in different places, it is very easy to forget the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is very easy when the work is heavy to lose the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope that whenever you work, you will always put the vision before you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is only when you have the vision that you can work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do not see the vision, you will not be able to work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What you have may merely be what you saw two months earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although you feel that the burden is still upon you, it is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brothers and sisters have not yet risen up, and they are still not working.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we should not worry about how great the outward difficulties are or how much people talk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The question is whether or not we have genuinely seen our way of service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we have seen clearly, we are putting all of our strength into this so that we may cause everyone to work in this way also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there are many people, thank God; if there are few, it does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church must take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If there is a local church with two thousand brothers and sisters and only five hundred are serving while fifteen hundred are not serving, it should be strange.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If there are five hundred brothers and sisters, then there should be five hundred who serve; otherwise, the brothers will not be able to bear the load.</S>
