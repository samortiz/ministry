C.</h2><p>I have seen that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and is made for prayer. This is the reason I spend a few hours every day praying. Brother Nee returned from England in 1939 and spoke about God's purpose in creating man. At that time I made a strong consecration. I saw that anything that is not of Christ, no matter how good it may be, should be condemned. In 1942, I had many family affairs to attend to, but I could not move my hands because of weak health and rheumatism. Later the Lord gave me the faith to reject this physical weakness. My hands were healed, and I was able to do many things. In 1945 my health took a turn for the worse again. At one point there was blood in my sputum. Meanwhile I still had to take a job. I began to realize that I had loved myself too much and that I was full of the self in many things. My limbs were completely without strength, Satan was attacking me, and my heart was full of fear. I became very sick and my feet became numb. One brother came to visit me and told me to stand up by the Lord. I stood up by faith. (Prior to that I had been in bed for 85 days.) At first I was about to fall, but someone held me tight. I declared the Lord's victory immediately, and the fear and the weakness went away.</p><p>When Brother Nee called the meetings in Shanghai, my heart was somewhat cold at the beginning. But I looked to the Lord to provide an opportunity for me to attend. Later the Lord said to me, "You can never be wrong if you follow the footsteps of the flock." My inner man became stronger every time I opened my mouth in the meetings. When I heard the message on handing oneself over, I felt that I had become different. Now I am willing to serve Him under His headship and in submission to authority.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Before a man's body receives the infusion of life, others touch death when they touch such a body. With many people, the supply of the natural life has not run out. As a result, they are not conscious of God's supernatural life. Only after a man has lost his natural life supply does he begin to treasure the supernatural life of God. God supplies the resurrection life only to those who have need. Paul was characterized by the little strength he had in his natural life. Actually, his physical body needed much energy to sustain him for the work. He accomplished more work than ten strong men. Yet he was sustained by the supply of the spiritual life. This is the reason he could do what others could not do. Whenever he labored for the Lord, he derived his very breath and pulse from his faith in God. This was his characteristic. It tells us what kind of supply he received from God for his spiritual work. He was able to say, "For when I am weak, then I am powerful" (2 Cor. 12:10). The times when he was weak were the very times when he was strong. Those were his strongest times. Such a spiritual contradiction occurs as one pays the price to learn the proper lessons before the Lord.</p><p>We should remember the Lord's word: "My power is perfected in weakness" (2 Cor. 12:9). This weakness was a weakness that Paul accepted. He asked the Lord three times to have the thorn removed. Today we do not know what this thorn was. We only know that it referred to something that never left him, that irritated him and weakened him. Paul prayed three times and then stopped. From that day forward, Paul accepted this weakness. If it had been an unwelcomed weakness, it would have done him no good. Paul accepted this weakness. This is the reason he was different. This is the reason he could boast in his weakness and the reason the power of Christ could overshadow him. Sooner or later the day will come when a man bows his head and says, "I accept the weakness that the Lord has placed on me." Paul was not the only man who was weak, but he was one of the very few people who would accept his weakness. Most people bargain with God when they are weak. They have their own opinions. They murmur against God and wrestle with Him. These ones will not see the power of God perfected in them. We know that there are more weak ones than strong ones in this world. But this does not mean that everyone who is weak will experience God's power being perfected in him. God's power is perfected only in those who accept the weakness. A man has to go through many scorchings, refinements, strugglings, and perils before he will bow his head, accept his weakness, and say, "I do not understand how I was lifted up. Yet I am! God has brought me through. I am still physically weak, and my inward being is still crippled and imperfect. Yet I am alive! I have accepted my weakness. The Holy Spirit spoke through Paul when he said, `For when I am weak, then I am powerful.' It seems as if I am able to say the same thing now." Once you reach this point and accept your weakness, you will spontaneously experience the next step, which is "when I am weak, then I am powerful." As for you, you will only boast in your weakness.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
