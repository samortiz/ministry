The first blessing in chapter five is a blessing in our spirit...(5:3). Thus,...if we do not know our spirit, we are through with the kingdom of the heavens.<p>With the coming of the [Lord Jesus as] the new King, God began a new economy....When the Pharisees asked the Lord Jesus when the kingdom of God would come, He replied, &#8220;Behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you&#8221; (Luke 17:21)....Where Jesus is, there the kingdom is also. The kingdom is simply the person of the King.</p><p>Turning our mind provides a gateway for us to enter into the kingdom and for the kingdom to enter into us. The mind is neither the receiver nor the inner chamber; it is the gateway. The receiver, the inner chamber, is our spirit.</p><p>Throughout the years, we have emphasized the importance of 2 Timothy 4:22: &#8220;The Lord be with your spirit.&#8221; We have always applied this to the matter of life. However,... this Lord Jesus is not only the Savior and the life, but also the King with the kingdom. Today we may declare, &#8220;In my spirit I have the Savior, the life, the King, and the kingdom!&#8221; When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus as the Savior, the life, and the King with the kingdom, He entered our spirit and was implanted there.</p><p>Please pay careful attention to the tense of the predicate in verse 3. It is not future tense, but present tense. This verse does not say, &#8220;Theirs will be the kingdom of the heavens&#8221;; it says, &#8220;Theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&#8221; When you open from the depths of your being, that is, from your spirit, and unload yourself and empty your spirit, the King as the life-giving Spirit will enter in through the gateway of your repentant mind and come into your spirit to be your King with the kingdom. From then on, the kingdom is within you, and the kingdom of the heavens is yours. This is salvation according to the New Testament. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 173-174, 176-178)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>4<sup>1</sup> The entire situation of the world is negative toward God&#8217;s economy. Satan, sin, self, darkness, and worldliness predominate among all people on earth. God&#8217;s glory is insulted, Christ is rejected, the Holy Spirit is frustrated, the church is desolate, self is corrupt, and the whole world is evil. God wants us to mourn over such a situation.</p><p>4<sup>2</sup> If we mourn according to God and His economy, we will be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens. We will see God&#8217;s heavenly ruling over the entire negative situation.<p>5<sup>1</sup> To be meek means not to resist the world&#8217;s opposition but to suffer it willingly.</p><p>6<sup>1</sup> Righteousness here denotes our being right in our behavior. We need to hunger and thirst for this righteousness, to seek after such righteousness, that we may enter into the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 10, 20).</p><p>7<sup>1</sup>To be righteous is to give one what he deserves, whereas to be merciful is to give one what he does not deserve. For the kingdom of the heavens we need to be not only righteous but also merciful.</p><p>7<sup>2</sup> To receive mercy is to receive what we do not deserve. If we are merciful to others, the Lord will give us mercy (2 Tim. 1:16, 18), especially at His judgment seat (James 2:12-13).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 173-179; Hymns: #611</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
