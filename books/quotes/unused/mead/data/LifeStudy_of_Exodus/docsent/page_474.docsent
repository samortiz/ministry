   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CENTER OF GOD S ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the diagram of the tabernacle and the outer court, the ark is the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, in actual practice the center is the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that Christ s interceding life is the center of the divine practice, the divine administration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the universe there is something that may be called God s economy, God s administration, God s practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may use different terms to describe this one matter: economy, administration, practice, dispensation, move, government.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All these terms may be regarded as synonymous, as referring to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that God s economy, dispensation, administration, government, move, and practice all refer to the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is not idle: He is a God of purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has a purpose, and He is moving, working, acting, dispensing, administrating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This diagram of the tabernacle is a very accurate and detailed picture of God s administration, God s economy, in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we study the incense altar, we are studying the greatest matter in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is nothing more central than this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we are not politicians, we surely are heavenly statesmen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, we are studying universal politics, that is, God s politics.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ark in the Holy of Holies is the central government, our heavenly Washington, D.C. The incense altar may be regarded as our heavenly White House.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that everything is executed, motivated, and carried out from this divine center.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The intercession of Christ is God s White House.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ s interceding life, His prayer life, is the center of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The book of Revelation is a book of God s administration, a book of divine execution.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This book reveals the throne of God and the administration of God throughout the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the executing center actually is not the throne; the executing center is the incense altar in Revelation 8.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 8:3 says, And another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him that He should add it to the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On this altar the prayers of the saints are offered to God, and Christ s incense is added to these prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the prayers of the saints ascend to God with the incense of Christ, God executes the policies of His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE PRAYER LIFE OF THE CORPORATE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The prayer life of Christ is the center of God s execution of His government on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 8 indicates this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But some who read chapter eight of Revelation may say, In Revelation 8 we cannot see Christ s prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can see only the prayers of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The saints, however, are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The prayers in Revelation 8 no longer are merely the prayers of the individual Christ, but have become the prayers of the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the matter of the execution that takes place at the incense altar, the saints truly are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, when we speak in this message of the prayer life of Christ, we mean the prayer life of the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, we need to realize that whenever we pray in the spirit, Christ is praying in our praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The New Testament speaks of praying in the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To pray in the name of the Lord Jesus is to pray in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we pray in this way, Christ is actually the one praying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, suppose you go to a bank to carry out a transaction in the name of another person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Will the bank honor your name or the name of the person you represent?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be sure, the bank will not recognize your name; instead, it will recognize the name of the person represented by you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a very real sense, because you are representing that person, you are that person, for you are acting in his name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In like manner, when we pray in Christ s name, we pray in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Also, when we pray in Him, Christ is actually the one praying.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He prays in us; He prays in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the sight of God, all the proper prayers of the saints and of the churches are prayers of Christ and are included as part of Christ s intercession.</S>
