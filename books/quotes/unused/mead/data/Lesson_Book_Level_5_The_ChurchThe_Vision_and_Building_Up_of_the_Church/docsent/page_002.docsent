   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's eternal purpose is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His purpose is not just to create man, to rescue him from his fallen condition, and to bring him to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, God's purpose is not simply to have us be holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Creation, salvation, sanctification, spirituality, and victory are all part of God's procedure to reach His goal, but they are not the goal itself.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What did God plan?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He planned to have a church composed of a group of human beings coordinated together as a corporate Body with which He may mingle Himself in His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, this corporate Body would be a corporate vessel, into which He would put Himself.</S>
