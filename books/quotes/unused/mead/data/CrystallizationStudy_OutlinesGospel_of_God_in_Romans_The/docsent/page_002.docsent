   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The redemption of Christ affords God the righteous ground to justify those who believe in Christ s redemption, and God is bound by His righteousness to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness..., so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus Rom 3:26.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3-5.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>11, 13, 19.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans reveals God in sanctification: God has made us one with Christ so that we may be sanctified not only positionally but also dispositionally; identification, thus, issues in sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have been baptized into Christ, and Christ has come into us; now we are in Christ, and also Christ is in us for us to be sanctified vv.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From within our spirit He spreads Himself into every part of our inner being to make His home in us; hence, when we set our mind on the spirit, our mind is life, and even our mortal body is given life through His indwelling vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>2, 6, 10-11; Eph 3:17.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this, He has made us His children by regenerating us; He is now leading us as His sons to grow up unto maturity so that we may be His heirs, joint heirs with Christ, to inherit the full sonship; this is to be glorified with our body fully redeemed vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>16, 14, 17, 23.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>26, 28-29.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The present conformation to the image of God s Son is the preparation for our future glorification in His Son; God is now bringing us into glory so that we may participate in His divine glory with His firstborn Son in the freedom of the glory v. 21.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Romans reveals God in His securing love: God is enjoyed by us in His love that secures our destiny vv.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In justification He has made us partakers of His righteousness, in sanctification He is working His holiness into our being, and in glorification He will bring us into His glory; now His love is the security of all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He loves us, and we are on His heart; nothing can separate us from His eternal and unchanging love that is in the redeeming Christ, who lives forever and who is interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are fully and eternally secured by God s eternal love in the unchanging Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because of God s unchanging love for us, neither tribulation nor persecution can suppress or defeat us; rather, in all these things we more than overcome and conquer through Him who loved us v. 37.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans reveals God in His selection: It was God who selected us, not we who selected Him John 15:16a; Rom 9:11; 11:5.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His selection is our destiny, which is of Him who calls and of His mercy and sovereignty to make us vessels of mercy to contain Him unto honor and glory 9:11, 15-16, 21, 23.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His selection is also by the righteousness which is out of faith and through Christ, who accomplished God s purpose v. 30; 10:4.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since His selection of us is of grace and not out of works, it is irrevocable; in His selection we are destined to have a share, a portion, in Him 11:5-6, 29.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Romans reveals God in the Body life: Eventually, God is glorified in the Body of Christ; we, as His many sons, are the many members of the Body of Christ, who is God s firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this Body our body has to be presented as one corporate sacrifice to God for His service, our soul has to be transformed by the renewing of our mind so that we may be built together in coordination for the Body to function, and our spirit has to be burning so that we may serve Him in zeal 12:1-6, 11.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order to keep the oneness of this Body, we have to receive all the believers in Christ, whom God and Christ have received; hence, we have to be general in doctrinal concepts so that we may build up one another to please God and glorify God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>1-6, 19, 18; 15:7.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Romans reveals God in the church life: The Body of Christ is spiritual and universal; it has to be expressed practically in various localities as churches.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is expressed in Christ, Christ is expressed in His Body, and the Body of Christ is expressed in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The local churches as the practical expression of the Body are spoken of as the church which is in Cenchrea, the churches of the Gentiles, the church in Prisca and Aquila s house, the churches of Christ, and the whole church 16:1, 3-5, 16, 23.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Between these churches there were the communication in love and the fellowship of concern among the saints for the sharing in the fullness of the blessing of Christ and for the crushing of Satan under their feet so that the grace of Christ could be dispensed to all the saints 15:25-29; 16:20.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Romans 15 and 16 God is called the God of endurance and encouragement, the God of hope, the God of peace, the eternal God, and the only wise God ; our God is rich in all these aspects, and the gospel in this book is the gospel of such a rich God, out from whom, through whom, and to whom are all things for His glory 15:5, 13; 16:20, 26-27; 11:36.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now to such a God, to the only wise God through Jesus Christ, to Him be the glory forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Amen 16:27.</S>
