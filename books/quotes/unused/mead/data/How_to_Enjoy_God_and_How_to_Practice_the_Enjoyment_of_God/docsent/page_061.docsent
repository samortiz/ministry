   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO BEHOLD GOD BEFORE WE PRAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we are able to restrict ourselves and turn to the Spirit in this way, we should not immediately open our mouths to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter 5 we considered ten points we should pay attention to when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After being calm we should behold God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that in order to pray, we must first touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must first touch God before we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that our spirit must touch the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we are busy with many outward things, there is no way for us to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we want to pray, we must free ourselves from all affairs, stop our mental activities, and turn our entire being from outward things to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must learn to exercise our spirit to touch God s Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we will learn to behold God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because God is Spirit and dwells in our spirit, it is not difficult to touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When our entire being is occupied, and we live in our mind, God seems to disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, He has not disappeared; rather, we have turned our backs on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not beholding Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But as soon as we are free from our thoughts and turn from the outward things to our spirit, we touch God immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to behold God, and this is to touch His presence in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As soon as we touch God in our spirit, we feel solid within; we feel that we have the anointing and the moving of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At this point we can open our mouths to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BEING AIDED TO TURN TO OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BY READING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some may say that it is difficult to turn to their spirit and behold God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>New believers may find it difficult to practice praying in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a person cannot turn to his spirit or be calm, he can start by reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He can then use the words of the Bible to calm his thoughts in order to turn to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He can turn any words that touch him into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is an easy way to turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some saints are able to turn directly to their spirit without any help.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever they want to pray, they only need to close their eyes, and they can stop their entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes they do not even need to close their eyes; they can turn to their spirit even while others are talking beside them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are not bothered by distractions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One brother said that he had learned to pray even while others were fighting in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He could calmly pray to touch the Lord, sense His presence, and be brought into the Holy Spirit, no matter how loudly they shouted.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a person is very experienced in his spirit; his spirit is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is able to control himself and is not bothered by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When he wants to pray, he can turn his entire being to his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, many brothers and sisters have not learned to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They cannot even be calm when they are alone, not to mention being calm when others argue and fight in their presence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that they are not restricted before God and that they are immature in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should never think that a person is mature simply because they have been a Christian for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Maturity does not depend on the number of years one has been a Christian, and it does not depend on the amount of teaching a person knows.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, maturity is related to our ability to be calm and turn to our spirit when we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we can do this, we are somewhat mature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we cannot, we are still quite young and cannot restrict ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, we must continue to exercise until we can stop ourselves and turn to our spirit when we are ready to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may not find it easy when we begin to practice, and we may need to use the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If so, we can read through the Bible slowly, allowing God s Word to touch our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can then turn the words of the Bible into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this way, it will be easy for us to be calm and turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we will behold God, we will see God; our spirit will contact God, and we will be able to offer genuine prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we utter such prayers, we still need to pay attention to the matter of touching God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we stop touching God, we should not force ourselves to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should, rather, continue reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should use the Bible as a support to help us enjoy God through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we are calm and can touch our spirit through reading the Word, we can start praying again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In short, we do not need to force ourselves to pray whenever our spirit is dry and we cannot touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we force ourselves, our spirit will receive no benefit but may actually be harmed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should rather stop our prayer and continue reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>PRACTICING TO PRAY BY TOUCHING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>IN THE SPIRIT AT ALL TIMES</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The only prayers that touch God are those offered in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only through such prayers can we receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should pray in this way, not only in the morning when we contact God but also in our time of prayer during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should always feel the watering, anointing, and divine presence while we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if we feel dry and void of God while we pray for a particular matter, we should stop praying and change the direction or subject of our prayer until we touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we can continue praying.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way we can remain in the spirit while we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to practice praying in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we learn to pray in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>May we have prayers that touch and absorb God.</S>
