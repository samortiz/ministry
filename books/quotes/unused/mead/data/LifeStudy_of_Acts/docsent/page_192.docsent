   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Righteous and the Unrighteous</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 24:15 Paul speaks of the resurrection: Having hope toward God, which these themselves also look for, that there is about to be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The resurrection of the righteous will occur before the millennium at the Lord s coming back 1 Cor 15:23; 1 Thes 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It will be the resurrection of life John 5:28-29a; Dan 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The resurrection of life is the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the coming back of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, it is called the resurrection of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also the resurrection of reward Luke 14:14 , when God will reward the saints Rev 11:18 at the Lord s return 1 Cor 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The resurrection of the righteous, which is the resurrection of life, also includes the first, or the best, resurrection Rev 20:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Revelation 20:5 and 6 speak of the first, or the best, resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first resurrection is the best one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not only the resurrection of life, but also the resurrection of reward, the ex-resurrection, that is, the extraordinary resurrection for which the apostle Paul sought Phil 3:11 , the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers so that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only the resurrected overcomers, such as the man-child in Revelation 12:5 and the later martyrs in Revelation 15:2, but also the raptured living ones, such as the firstfruit in Revelation 14:1-5, will have part in the first resurrection Rev 20:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Philippians 3:11 Paul refers to the first, or best, resurrection as the out-resurrection: If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from among the dead at the Lord s coming back 1 Thes 4:16; 1 Cor 15:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the overcoming saints will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is called in Hebrews 11:35 the better resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To arrive at the out-resurrection means that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God first resurrected our deadened spirit John 5:25; Eph 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then from our spirit He proceeds to resurrect our soul Rom 8:6 and our mortal body Rom 8:11 , until our entire being spirit, soul, and body is fully resurrected out of our old being by and with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a process in life through which we must pass and a race for us to run until we arrive at the out-resurrection as the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the out-resurrection should be the goal and destination of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can reach this goal only by being conformed to the death of Christ Phil 3:10 , by living a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the death of Christ we are processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have pointed out that in Acts 24:15 Paul says that there will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The resurrection of the unrighteous will occur after the millennium Rev 20:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will be the resurrection of judgment John 5:29 and of shame and everlasting contempt Dan 12:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This resurrection of judgment will be the resurrection of the perished unbelievers after the millennium Rev 20:5, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the thousand years to be judged at the great white throne Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, it is called the resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation 20:12 the word standing indicates the dead have been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the resurrection of judgment for eternal perdition upon the unrighteous after the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the resurrection concerning which the apostle Paul warned unrighteous Felix in Acts 24:25.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the unsaved will be in the resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because they will be condemned to eternal perdition, their resurrection will be of shame and everlasting contempt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul, in his wisdom, mentioned this resurrection as a warning to Felix.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul s word implies that Felix should prepare himself to face the coming resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we shall see, later on Paul spoke directly to Felix concerning the coming judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul s Exercise to Have a Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>without Offense</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 24:16 Paul said to Felix, In this I also exercise myself, to have always a conscience without offense toward God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul uttered a similar word when he defended himself before the Sanhedrin: I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day 23:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have seen that for Paul to conduct himself in all good conscience before God was a great return to God from man s fall.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul spoke such a word to vindicate himself before those who accused him of being a lawless and even a reckless person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul s testimony in 23:1 and 24:16 concerning his conscience showed his high standard of morality in contrast to the hypocrisy of the Jewish religionists and the crookedness of the Roman politicians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As we continue on in Acts 24, we shall see more concerning the corruption of Roman politics.</S>
