   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being according to the Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not according to Religious Rituals</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord s grace in us is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, since we have not been adequately trained and lack exercise and practice, we are accustomed to attending worship services and sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From an early age I went to Sunday worship services with my mother.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we entered the chapel, we would simply sit down.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christianity requires believers to sit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was in elementary school, all the students were required to dress neatly on the Lord s Day and then go to school to wait for the teachers arrival.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once the teachers arrived, they led us to Sunday school to sit in small pews and then to the big chapel to sit in large pews.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was truly a suffering to me because I wanted to play soccer, but instead I had to go and sit in a pew.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today we are under this influence to sit whenever we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sitting does not require any learning or practice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is common for Christians all over the world to attend and sit through a service, because we have not been trained to meet according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, in large gatherings two young brothers lead the singing of hymns and the reading of the Bible from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, the singing and the reading are very orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, why is it necessary for them to be on the podium?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a religious ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Can they not simply rise from their seats and read?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They can surely rise from their seats and say, We will read Acts 2:42.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This would be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, it is also possible to turn a practice of not going to the podium to sing hymns and to read the Word into a religious ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must realize that religious rituals are part of our very constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The only way to be delivered from religious rituals is to be according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In our spirit we know whether or not we are meeting according to religious rituals because things of religion cannot enliven people or gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every time we meet, we should stand against our religious constitution; instead, we should do everything according to the spirit, including singing, praying, and testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we can grasp this principle and practice it, our small groups will definitely have a future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let me give another example.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose a brother who has not met for a long time comes back and says, I have not met for twenty years, but I have a favorite hymn, Jesus loves me, this I know.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although he has called a hymn, it is not in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Should we say, This hymn is not in our hymnal, so let us not sing it ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we did this, he would be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to exercise our spirit because there are many situations in the small groups that can never be handled by applying regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather than saying anything to the brother, we also could be silent, using the excuse that since there is no leader or responsible one in the small group, we should do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This would be like throwing cold water on him, and it would not be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Again, we should exercise our spirit and pray inwardly, O Lord, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have had this experience; when we look to the Lord, He will lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps He may give someone the leading to say, Those of us who know this hymn can sing together, and those of us who do not know it can learn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will comfort the brother s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although Jesus loves me, this I know is a very shallow hymn, it will be very sweet, and the brother will be recovered if everyone sings in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If no one knows this hymn, someone can say, Brother, if you tell us the first stanza, we will follow along.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This hymn can be like a drop of dew that brings in a river.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After singing, someone can follow with a prayer: Lord, we thank You!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You love our brother, and You love every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today we are enjoying Your love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although this is a small matter, it can turn into a flow of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although I have written outlines concerning the small group gatherings, all of these are merely principles; the practice is entirely a matter of being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fellowship in the small groups must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From this fellowship we can know a brother s situation, problems, and burdens so that everyone can intercede and share the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our responses must always follow the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not necessarily need to shed tears every time we hear someone s problems.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even the expression of our love must be a matter in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All that I have written in the outlines and spoken in this meeting is in the nature of fellowship; when the time comes, we must do everything according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Singing Hymns and Praying</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The content of the small group gatherings also includes singing hymns and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Christian meetings there will be singing and praying, but we should not treat these as rituals or forms.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Christians meet today, they sing, then pray, and at the conclusion they sing and pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These are all religious rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In our Christian meetings we also sing and pray, but sometimes we do not sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, it is rare when there are no prayers, because we have a spirit that needs to breathe, and prayer is our breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It would be difficult to meet for one to two hours without any prayer; this would suffocate us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Prayer may be in the form of thanking, praising, extolling, or petitioning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In any case, whether we are singing or praying, there should be no regulations or rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the small group gatherings we do not need to wait for everyone to arrive in order to call a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This indicates that our singing is a ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In large meetings in Christianity arrangements are made beforehand to have Pastor So-and-so call a hymn and Doctor So-and-so lead the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must not allow the singing and praying in our small groups to follow this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If three or five persons are gathered and have a genuine burden to sing hymns, they should sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Singing hymns should be according to inspiration and the mood of the gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If there is no inspiration or mood to sing, there is no need to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The same principle applies to praying.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should not turn singing and praying into rituals.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, we can offer praise and thanks to God for His many answers to prayer since the group last gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At the same time that we are giving thanks and praise to the Lord, we can let our requests be made known to God, and there can be prayers related to the execution of God s will and the accomplishment of the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If the Spirit moves and leads us in this direction during our gatherings, we should follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These matters are not rituals.</S>
