   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first selection resulted in twenty-two thousand people leaving.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Second Selection</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The selection this time was based on a very small matter, that of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A small matter always exposes what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In those days both the Jews and the Arabs carried their luggage on their backs when they traveled.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There were two ways to drink water along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One was to put down the luggage and kneel, bowing down to the ground to drink with the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The other was to leave the luggage on the back and drink by putting the hand to the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The latter was done for the sake of saving time for the journey and also for guarding oneself from robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Among the ten thousand, nine thousand and seven hundred drank with their mouths directly to the water, while three hundred drank by putting water in their hand to the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who drank directly with their mouths were eliminated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who drank by bringing water in their hand to the mouth were selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A person who has the chance to indulge himself but who will not do so is one who has been dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This kind of person can be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God can only use those who are willing to be unconditionally dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The three conditions by which God selects the overcomers are: 1 being absolute for God s glory, 2 being afraid of nothing, and 3 allowing the cross to deal with the self.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One can judge for himself if he is an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God will test us, and we will be exposed as to whether or not we are overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only those who know the victory of the cross will be able to maintain the victory of the cross.</S>

   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Individual victory is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Gideon and those three hundred men moved together and acted in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All of their flesh was cut off, so they could be one.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is the oneness in the Spirit and a living in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The record in the New Testament is a record of meetings rather than a record of working.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Result</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The three hundred men fought the battle, yet the whole congregation chased the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The three hundred labored, yet the whole congregation reaped the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When we overcome, the whole body is revived.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>To stand at the bottom of the river is not for ourselves, but for the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I...fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church Col 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>To be an overcomer, we also have to suffer the murmurings of the people, in the same way that Gideon suffered the murmurings of the men from Ephraim.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Gideon not only defeated the Midianites from without but also defeated the Midianites from within.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Only this kind of person can continue to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>They were weary yet pursuing Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>8:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Afternoon, January 29</S>
