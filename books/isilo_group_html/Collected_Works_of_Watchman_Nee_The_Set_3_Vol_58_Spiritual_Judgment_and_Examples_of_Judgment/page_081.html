H.</h2><p>In myself, I find nothing worthy of a testimony; there is nothing but corruption in me [weeping as she testified]. I was born in 1909 and almost died the day I was born. My family put me on the floor and called for a doctor. They placed me in a tub of hot water. My parents prayed for me the whole night. After fifty days I became well. When I was a child, I consecrated myself to the Lord in a gospel church. After I grew up, I decided to study medicine. I graduated from Peking Medical College. Others considered me a saint in school because I was both the leader of the Bible study group and the superintendent of the Moral Department. When others asked if I was saved, I would retort arrogantly, "Are you more saved than I am?" Later someone else asked me the same question. I was convicted, for I was not clear about my salvation. In time someone showed me the book Why Did He Come? After I read it, I became clear about my need for salvation. I accepted the Lord but still had many questions. When Brother Nee came, I presented these questions to him. Later I began to cover my head and was baptized. I also had a desire to go to the inland regions to preach the gospel. Three years after I was saved, I married a brother. Later I went to Yunnan, Kunming, and worked in a hospital through the Lord's arrangement. I had one son who died soon after he was born. I have often grieved over this.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>Your words today show that you are not yet free from your past feelings. Some of the events, like your son's death, happened seven or eight years ago. These feelings should have faded after so many years. You should have been dealt with in your emotion already. Of course, the death of a dear son is a great thing to a mother, but if you have indeed experienced God's dealing, this should have been set aside already. If your present state still reflects your past feelings, it means that you need more dealings. If your emotion is truly dealt with, your feelings today should not be so entangled with your emotion. You should only be slightly affected now. Any dealing that you have is reflected in the degree of intensity of your feelings.</p><p>Apparently, the dealings our sister experienced were very cruel. Even though she cried, her crying was not bitter enough. Although she was sad, she was not sad and heartbroken enough. Although she was sorrowful, her sorrow did not make others sorrowful. Please forgive me for saying such a strong word. A man's spirit is like a camera; it must be in focus. If the focus is proper, the pictures are clear. If the focus is not proper, one can still identify the shapes, but he cannot know who is in the picture. If your spirit is calibrated to the Spirit of God's Son, your spirit will also be calibrated to others' spirit. In order for your spirit to make an impact on others' spirit, it must aim accurately. If your spirit is without emotional mixture and if your scars are deep enough, it will easily reach others' spirit. But if your spirit is mixed, it will not be easy to direct it toward others' spirit. The mixture of emotions will reach others first. They will not be able to feel what you feel. They will not be able to sense the problems you are facing, because your spirit will be contaminated by your emotion.</p><p>It is the Lord's wonderful arrangement that you have a very emotional husband. Although your emotion is strong, your husband's emotion is even stronger. A joyful spirit can make everyone joyful, and a wounded spirit can touch others' spirit. This is not like shaking hands with gloves on. If your spirit is without any mixture, everyone will respond with an amen when you speak; that is the ministry of the spirit. If the Lord has operated on you once, whenever He is released through your spirit, there will be an impact on others' spirit. It will be like touching some with ice or scalding others with hot water. Let me say a cruel word to you again. If you contact others in your present condition, they will never feel your pain. Although you have experienced some dealings from the Lord, your spirit has not broken through; it is not released enough. A man with a strong spirit will release his spirit as soon as he testifies, and the spirit of others will be revived. They will feel as if they are taking a cold shower in the hot summer. If your emotion is dealt with seriously, you will no longer be able to return to your former feelings. If you can return to your former feelings, it means that the dealings you have received are not deep enough. If your emotion is truly dealt with, you will forget about the feelings you had a few years ago. They will seem as if they are the feelings of someone else. The apostle Peter denied the Lord, but a month later, he was able to forget everything and rebuke the men of Israel, saying, "But you denied the holy and righteous One" (Acts 3:14). In Greek the word deny is the same word that is used when Peter denied the Lord. Peter was a man with feelings. Yet he put the greatest denial in the whole world, which he himself committed, behind him. His denial was more serious than that of the people of Israel. Therefore, you have to ask the Lord to deal with your emotion in a strict way. You have to ask Him to deal with you to such an extent that you become absolutely free from your past feelings. Then you will live in an entirely different realm.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 81</div><br></body></html>
