   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, we must not consider this book to be merely "a book of symbols."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Though it has more than thirty symbols, half of them have been interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the whole book has only twenty-two chapters, it averages out to no more than one symbol per chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How can we say that this is "a book of symbols"?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are two kinds of prophecies in this book: direct and indirect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because some think that Revelation is only on symbols, they end up with many passages that they do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although this book has many indirect symbols, they are not altogether left in the dark without explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reader should not feel completely at a loss simply because of the many symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, he should distinguish between the explained ones and the unexplained ones and find out their meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the style of this book includes symbols, we should not spiritualize the book in its entirety.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One thing to remember is that Revelation is an "open" book Rev 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not like Daniel which is a "sealed" book Dan 12:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, this book is called Revelation; everything recorded is open revelation and is for man to know.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the entire book is a literal account based on facts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can understand it by its literal meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moreover, what was recorded at the end of this book are literal signs: resurrection, rapture, descension, etc. Therefore, what was recorded at the beginning of this book must be literal punishment because this is a book in which the end matches the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Earlier we have said that Revelation is also a book of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is said that the Old Testament contains one hundred nineteen prophecies concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How were all these prophecies fulfilled?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were fulfilled literally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, prophecies such as the virgin birth, the place of Bethlehem, the escape to Egypt, and the thirty pieces of silver were all fulfilled literally.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this book, except for some symbols, God speaks in plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We admit that the book has spiritual meanings and lessons, but its facts are all explained literally.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, after the seventh seal is opened, the seven angels will sound the trumpets.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The hail, fire, blood, mountain, sea, stars, sun, moon, etc., in the seventh trumpet must be explained literally.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, we can also derive much spiritual meaning and lessons from them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must not consider only the spiritual significance of Revelation and disregard the fearfulness of the literal punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here we see the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He conceals the spiritual significance inside the clear letters so that those who have been taught more by God can see deeper lessons apart from the letters of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the same time, the ordinary believers may learn directly from the book the actual condition of the coming tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word of the Lord is revealed to infants Matt 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the word is as hard as most people say, how can the babes understand?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We praise the Lord because, even though Revelation has some difficult passages, the babes in the Lord can still understand it, for many places can be taken literally, and all who can read can understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We further praise the Lord that although the word is simple enough for an ordinary believer to understand, at the same time the best minds in the world can find much material for their research.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our God is truly God!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The nature of Revelation is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the beginning to the end it shows forth God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not easy for us to find God's grace in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even towards the church, the words are extremely strict.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is truly a book of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In it we see the Lord's judgment upon the church, the Jews, and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This book reveals the Lord Jesus and speaks of His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because the nature of this book is different from the other books of the New Testament, most people consider it too hard.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, it is not hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church had already failed, and the only recourse the Lord had was to judge her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, the record in chapters two and three is the precursor of the Lord's judgment at His judgment seat 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Except for chapters four and five, which record the things in transition, what is recorded from chapters six through nineteen are events in the last week, that is, the seventieth week referred to in Daniel see the subsequent section "The Seventy Weeks in Daniel" .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The seventy weeks in Daniel are all in the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The age of grace is the interval between the sixty-ninth and seventieth week.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, when the age of grace comes to an end, the seventieth week begins, which will still be in the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the things mentioned in chapters six through nineteen are things within the age of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No wonder in nature it is so righteous!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because Revelation is righteous and of the law, it carries much Jewish character.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church here is different from the church in Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even though Revelation was written in Greek, a number of Hebraic words and expressions were used, such as "Abaddon," etc. The titles of our Lord also bear much Jewish character, such as Jehovah God, etc. The Gospel of Matthew quotes scriptures from the Old Testament about ninety-two times.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The book of Hebrews quotes about one hundred and two times.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Revelation quotes approximately two hundred and eighty-five times.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This substantiates the fact that God will go back to the realm of the Old Testament to deal with the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Salvation is of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The saints of the Lord should learn how to love the Jewish people and not to show displeasure toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should love them as the Lord's chosen people.</S>
