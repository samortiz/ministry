<P>God created us without the element of holiness, but He intended to make us holy. In order to make us holy, God had to take a second step after the first step of the old creation. God had to take a second step to make the new creation out of the old creation. Before I was saved, I was a part of the old creation of God. God was not in me. But one day when I was nineteen years old, I turned to God and opened up myself to Him. At that moment God sowed Himself into me. God planted Himself as a small seed into my being. The holy nature of God came into me as a small seed, and that seed is organic.</P><P>I would like to give a testimony as an example of the growth of God's holy nature within us. When I was young, I was fond of playing soccer. A few years after I got saved, I was playing soccer, and the ball came to me. When it reached me, I stopped. I could not kick the ball. Something within me turned away, so I walked off the playing field. People wondered what happened to me. They may have thought I was sick, but I was not sick. The living, holy seed of the divine nature had been growing within me, and this living, organic divine nature did not agree to kick the ball. I wanted to kick the ball, but another element within me, another person within me, would not go along with me. Instead, I had to go along with Him, so I walked off the playing field. This is the Christian life.</P><P>The Christian life is not a matter of outward regulations. We live the Christian life by something organic growing within us. By the growth of the seed of holiness within me, I was sanctified from playing soccer. From that day, when I walked off the playing field about sixty years ago, I never played soccer again. There is not a verse in the Bible that says Christians should not play soccer. But the One who was growing in me would not play soccer. I wanted to play, but He did not. This was the growing of the holy God within me. This is something precious.</P><P>Ephesians 1:4 says that God chose us to be holy, and verse 5 says that in choosing us, He predestinated us unto sonship. Why did God predestinate us? Why did God put a mark on us to indicate that we belong to Him? This is because God wanted not only to make us holy as He is but also to make us His sons. How could God make us His sons? God made us His sons not by adopting us but by begetting us. He made us His sons by sowing His seed, His divine life, into our being. His divine life was sown into our being along with His nature. This divine life, after getting into us, begets us to make us the sons of God. We were not adopted by God, but we were begotten by Him. Because of His begetting, we all have become sons of God.</P><P>Now what is within us? For holiness, the nature of God is within us. For sonship, the life of God is within us. I had been reading Ephesians for many years, but I did not see this until recently. One day I saw that Ephesians 1:4 and 5 show the dispensing of God's holy nature into us and the dispensing of God's life into our being. We are human beings, but we have the divine nature and the divine life. We all need to declare, "Hallelujah! I have the holy nature of God, so I am holy. I have the divine life, so I am divine. I am a divine son of God with His divine life and His holy nature!"</P>
