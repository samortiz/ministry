   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the time He walked on earth in disguise, men did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God was disguised among men, and men did not recognize Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It takes God's Spirit to open men's eyes before they can recognize this Jesus as the Son of God and the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible, in a way, is like Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Humanly speaking, it is a book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps it is a little more special than other books.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But when God's Spirit opens a man's eyes, he will see that this is no ordinary book; it is God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It reveals God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just as Jesus of Nazareth is the living Son of God, this book is a revelation of the living Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we only see this book as a book, we do not know God's Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who do not know God's Son do not know Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the same way, those who do not know God's Son do not know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who know Jesus know God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same way, those who know the Bible should know that the Lord Jesus is God's Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They should know the very Son of God spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This book the Bible reveals God's Son; it reveals Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not an ordinary book.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Lord Jesus was walking on earth, His contemporaries had many things to say about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They criticized Him in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some said that He was Jeremiah; others said that He was one of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some said this and some said that.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Lord Jesus asked the disciples, "But you, who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What did the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Knowledge of the Lord Jesus does not come from flesh and blood, but from the revelation of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Following this, the Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church" Matt 16:15-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without such a revelation there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The whole church is built upon this foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When a man recognizes that the historical Jesus is God's Christ and Son, this seeing becomes the foundation upon which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some people lament, saying, "I was born two thousand years too late.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I had been born two thousand years earlier, I could have gone to Jerusalem and could have seen the Lord Jesus face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Jews did not believe Jesus was the Son of God, but I would have believed."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But even if these ones had been able to live, walk, and work together with the Lord Jesus every day, they still would not have known Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They would have known the man Jesus only; they would not have known who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord was on earth, men conjectured much about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They realized that He was quite special, that He was different from other men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peter, however, was a man who did not have to guess about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He saw Him and he knew Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How did he know Him?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First God shone His light on him and showed him that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without God's revelation, a man can follow the Lord everywhere and still not see.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if a man followed the Lord to Caesarea Philippi, he still would not know who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A man can be with the Lord every day and still not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is not known through outward acquaintance but through revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The knowledge of the Lord Jesus is something that comes from revelation, not from acquaintance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do not have revelation, you may live with Him for ten years without knowing who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You will only know Him as the Christ and the Son of God when you have God's revelation, when He speaks within you, and when He unveils your inner eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Your outward acquaintance of Him is not a true knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The same thing can be said of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's Word is a person, and God's word is also a book.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God's Word is Jesus of Nazareth, and His word is also the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need God to open our eyes before we can recognize Jesus of Nazareth as being the Word of God and the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same way, God has to open our eyes before we will recognize the Bible as being the word of God and a revelation of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who were acquainted with the Lord Jesus and who lived with Him for many years did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the same way, those who are acquainted with the Bible and who have read and studied it for many years do not necessarily know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is the need of God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only that which God reveals to us through revelation is living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The story of the healing of the woman with a flow of blood in Mark 5 shows us that many people were pressing upon the Lord Jesus, but no one touched Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Among them all, only the woman with the flow of blood touched the garment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She thought that if she could only touch the Lord's garment, she would be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She had faith, and she was sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She came to touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As soon as she touched Him, she was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord immediately asked, "Who touched My garments?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the disciples heard this, they said, "You see the crowd pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The disciples complained about the crowd that was pressing upon Him all around and wondered how the Lord could even ask who was touching Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet as soon as someone touched the Lord, He knew it, and He could feel it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many people pressed upon Him, but nothing happened to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But the one who touched Him experienced an immediate change.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today, even if the Lord were to stand right next to you, He would do you no good if you were only pressing upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Jesus of Nazareth is not known by pressing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Those who pressed against Him did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only the one who had faith and discernment touched His garment and knew who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This man was Jesus of Nazareth, yet He was also the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Many people pressed upon Jesus of Nazareth, but they did not touch the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Many people touch the outward Jesus, but they do not touch the Son of God.</S>
