   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Washing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word of God also washes us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It washes our being organically and metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When God s word enters into our fibers organically, it washes us metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, the word of God builds us up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As members of the church, the Body, we all need to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because we are peculiar, it is difficult for anyone to deal with us, much less to build us together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the word of God can touch us inwardly and make it possible for us to be built up in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because we are peculiar in ourselves, we cannot be built up in this way unless the word of Christ inhabits us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the peace of Christ arbitrates within us, it is not the peace which builds us up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The peace keeps us in the proper situation for the building work to be done by God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because it is the word of Christ which builds us up, I bear a heavy burden to release God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more the word of God is released among us, the more building up there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Completing and Perfecting</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word of God also completes and perfects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Elsewhere we have pointed out that a baby is complete in organs, but not in functions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order for a child s bodily organs to function properly, the child needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perfection always comes by the way of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more a child grows, the more his functions are completed and perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The same is true in spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As members of the Body, we all should function.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we would function, we first need to be perfected by the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because God s word nourishes us, we have growth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then through the growth, the functions come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The nourishment we receive from the word of God completes us and perfects us as members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, we say that the word of God perfects us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Edifying</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The last function of the word of God we shall consider in this message is its function of edifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a difference between being built up and being edified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Being built up is related to the church corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being edified involves being built up individually, primarily in the matter of virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all need to be edified, or built up in a personal way, for we all lack certain virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, we may be short of such virtues as patience, wisdom, humility, or kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word of God truly edifies us in the matter of virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we have of the word of God, the more virtues we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our kindness, patience, wisdom, and humility will all be increased by the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of us need to be edified in virtues through God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some of us are characterized by quickness and others, by slowness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In certain situations quickness is a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a group of brothers need to hurry to be on time for an important appointment, quickness is a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But in taking care of someone who is very ill, slowness may be a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to be edified so that we may be able to act either quickly or slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In certain situations we need to speak in a free, bubbling way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in other situations we should be very restricted in speaking, even silent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the right situation speaking in a bubbling way is a virtue, but in other situations it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The same is true of quietness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In matters such as these we all need edification.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only the word of God can edify us and cause us to be properly balanced, discerning, and moderate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Concerning quickness and slowness, we need to be moderate.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should be moderate even in our love.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some saints love others according to their emotional tide.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the tide of love is high, they love others excessively.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But when the tide is low, they do not show love for anybody.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They seem to be like statues, altogether without feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>First we need to be edified personally in the matter of virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we shall be built up together with others in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have seen that the word of God enlightens, nourishes, quenches our thirst, strengthens, washes, builds up, perfects, and edifies.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What a great need we have for the word of God!</S>
