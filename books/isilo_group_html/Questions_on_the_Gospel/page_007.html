If so, what is the difference?<h2 class=head1>ANSWER</h2><p>There is a difference, and this difference is related to the forgiveness of sins and justification. The word blessed in verse 7 refers to a negative aspect; whereas the word blessed in verse 8 is speaking of a positive aspect. Verse 7 says that God forgives man&#8217;s iniquities and covers his sins, while verse 8 says that God works to such an extent that a man can be regarded as though he had never sinned: &#8220;by no means account sin.&#8221; This is to be justified.<p>What then is the difference between forgiveness and justification? Forgiveness means that even though you have sinned, God has forgiven your sins. Justification means that you are regarded as a righteous person that has never committed a sin. Suppose a man is judged by the court and found guilty; therefore, he should receive a punishment. Later, he may be granted amnesty and released by the court. This is receiving forgiveness. But being justified is like going through the court and being declared not guilty. This is being justified.<p>The Lord saved us not only to forgive us but also to justify us. This is grace! The shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus has completely solved our problem of sin. Since we were resurrected together with Him and in Him, God sees us as if we had never sinned. God, in Christ, has worked to such an extent that we are as complete as Christ. Colossians 2:10 says, &#8220;And you have been made full in Him.&#8221; God sees us the same way He sees Christ, and He loves us the same way He loves Christ. God sees us as being complete in Christ.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Questions on the Gospel &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
