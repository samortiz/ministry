   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE CHURCH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PILLAR AND BASE OF THE TRUTH Scripture Reading: John 1:17; 8:32; 14:6, 17; 17:17; 1 Tim 3:15; 2 Tim 2:15 TRUTH BEING NOT DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BUT A PERSON WHO IS REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word truth is used repeatedly in the two Epistles to Timothy 1 Tim 2:4; 3:15; 4:3; 6:5; 2 Tim 2:15-18; 3:8; 4:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many Christians think that truth is simply doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in verses such as John 1:17; 8:32; 14:6; and 17:17, it is clear that the word doctrine could not be used in place of truth, which is sometimes rendered reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to see the difference between truth and doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Truth is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:17 gives a comparison between the law and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse says, The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The law was given, but reality came.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A thing is given, but a person comes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The word law indicates a large portion of the Old Testament, which is called the Law and the Prophets Acts 13:15; Matt 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Law is the first section of the Old Testament, from Genesis through the Song of Songs; the Prophets is the second section of the Old Testament, from Isaiah through Malachi.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The law was given as a shadow, figure, or type, just as a photograph of a person may be sent before the person comes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law is the picture, and the reality is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us consider a few examples of the types in the Old Testament and the reality in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 1:26 says that man was made in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reality of the image of God is Christ Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ came as the real image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Genesis 2:9 mentions the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ came as the reality of the tree of life John 14:6; 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Genesis 3:15 prophesies that the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reality of the seed of the woman came when Christ was born of the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the real seed of the woman who bruised the head of Satan Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Exodus 12:3-10 describes the Passover lamb that was slain for the salvation of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When John the Baptist saw the Lord, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The lamb in Exodus 12 is a shadow, a picture, of the real Lamb, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such pictures are found throughout the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Exodus 25 through 30 God gave Moses the pattern for the Israelites to build the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>John 1:14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ in the flesh was the real tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the reality of all the things mentioned in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Leviticus describes all kinds of offerings the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the offerings are shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ came, the reality of the offerings came.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the real burnt offering, the real meal offering, the real peace offering, the real sin offering, and the real trespass offering for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The offerings in the Old Testament are only shadows; Christ is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the real light and the real life John 8:12; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is also the real power, holiness, righteousness, kindness, love, humility, longsuffering, endurance, submission, and every divine attribute and human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Truth is not doctrine but reality, and the reality of every positive thing, even human beings, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without Christ we are empty, having no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we receive Christ, we are no longer empty, for we have the reality, which is Christ, as our real person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul says, To me, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To him, to live was not Paul, which would have been empty, but Christ, who is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Doctrine Being the Description of the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Doctrine is the description of the truth, and it conveys the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The truth is the reality of what is described in the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The doctrine of God s image is in Genesis 1:26; the reality of God s image is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Apart from Christ, God s image in Genesis 1:26 is merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Justification by faith is the main doctrine of the Lutheran Church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I knew a pastor of a Lutheran congregation in China who strongly preached justification by faith but who had not been justified himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although he preached justification by faith, he was secretly smuggling opium.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then a Norwegian missionary went to China to preach not the doctrine of the gospel but the reality regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever she finished speaking a gospel message, she would stand by the entrance as the audience went out and ask each one, Have you been regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One day she visited the town of that Lutheran pastor, and after preaching a message on regeneration, she asked the pastor in front of several members of his congregation whether he had been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When he replied that he had, she said that she could tell by looking at his face that actually he had not been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He was greatly offended by this and began to hate her.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That night he planned how he might kill her.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While he was planning, the Holy Spirit said to him, Look, how evil you are!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You are planning to kill a lady evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Have you been regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was enlightened and immediately repented.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The next day he came to the meeting to make a public repentance and a testimony of what he had experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By hearing his testimony, many others were led to be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The doctrine of regeneration and the reality of regeneration are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to be saved not according to doctrine but according to the truth, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not have the doctrine of something yet miss the reality.</S>
