<p>I am looking to the Lord that this outline with this short fellowship can be a controlling vision to us for our direction and goal until He comes back. We want to see the most marvelous, excellent, mysterious, and all-inclusive transformations of the eternal and Triune God in His becoming a man. God is complete, perfect, and unchanging, but He has had many transformations. In my youth I was taught that the Lord Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Heb. 13:8). But after I got into the intrinsic depths of the Scriptures, I found out that merely to say this is not adequate in the interpretation of the deep mysteries concerning Christ, because the Bible shows us that God has been transformed. God became a man. Is this not a transformation? All of His transformations are marvelous, excellent, mysterious, and all-inclusive.</p>
