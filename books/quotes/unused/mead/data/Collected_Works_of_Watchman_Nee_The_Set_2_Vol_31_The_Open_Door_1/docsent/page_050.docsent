   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3 The post office no longer accepts large packages of printed materials, so once this publication is printed, we will send one or two copies by the quickest method to each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we will send a large number of copies to the responsible brothers in each locality and ask them to pass them out to all the brothers and sisters in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we will send them out according to the subscription lists.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, some localities do not accept wired money any longer; nor do we know where some of the brothers and sisters have moved to.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, we ask God to care for the brothers and sisters in tribulation in these difficult times on the one hand, and we hope that the brothers and sisters who have news would send the details to us by airmail or express mail on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there are offerings or letters, please send both to Brother Lan Tsi-yi or Miss Ruth Lee, P. O. Box 84, Hankow.</S>
