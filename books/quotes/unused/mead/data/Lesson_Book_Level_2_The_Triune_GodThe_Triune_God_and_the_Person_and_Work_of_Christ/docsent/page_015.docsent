   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD BEING TRIUNE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Often in the Old Testament the one God refers to Himself as "Us."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Genesis 1:26 He says, "Let us make man in our image."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This clearly declares that God is plural; but here, in verse 26, the Hebrew word used for the "image" of God is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God is "us," plural, the "image" of "us" is singular, one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, this also means that God is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From Genesis 1, we go to Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After man's fall, God again uses the plural pronoun for Himself: "The Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil" Gen 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Genesis 11, men had become so rebellious against God that they built the tower of Babel and the city of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then God said, "Let us go down" Gen 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Again God uses the plural pronoun in referring to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we can see clearly that when God uses the plural pronoun in speaking about Himself, it is always in His relation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When God created man, He used the plural pronoun for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God took care of fallen man, He used the plural pronoun again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And when God came to deal with rebellious man, He also used the plural pronoun.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the Triune God is for God's dealing with man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis 1, when God was creating all the other things, He never used the plural pronoun for Himself though the word "God" is triple in number.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems that to all the other creatures, God was just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But whenever God is related to man, He is Triune.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, THE GOD OF ISAAC,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>AND THE GOD OF JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Exodus 3:6 the Lord said to Moses, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This passage reveals that God is threefold when related to His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With the God of Abraham the emphasis is on the Father; with the God of Isaac the emphasis is on the Son; with the God of Jacob the emphasis is on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we can see something of the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, with Abraham we see one who was called out of a godless background to participate in God's blessing and purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This reveals the Father's calling 1 Cor 1:9; Eph 1:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Second, Isaac was the son promised to Abraham who was later required to be offered up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This reveals to us the Son who was promised to us from God and was offered back to God through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Last, in Jacob's experience we see the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jacob was a person always under God's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He tried so hard to make things work the way he wanted, yet God always arranged the environment to cause Jacob to trust in God rather than in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This represents the transforming work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah for our God!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the One who called us into His wonderful purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the One who is our promised portion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the One who is transforming us into His very image.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
