   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWTH IN LIFE AND BUILDING BEING INSEPARABLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's purpose in coming into us in the form of food to be mingled with us as our life and to grow in us is to build a temple, which is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, in the Scriptures we often see that growth and building are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nearly all of the verses listed at the beginning of the chapter refer to both growth and building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 3:9b says, "You are God's cultivated land, God's building."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As God's cultivated land, we need to grow; as God's building, we need to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, growth is building, and building is growth; these two things cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, Ephesians 2 says that this spiritual house, this dwelling place of God, is built up by growing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>21-22 , just as our body reaches its full stature by growing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, 1 Peter 2 says that having been saved and having put away sins, we need to long for the spiritual milk so that we may grow vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Following this, it says that as living stones we are being built up as a spiritual house v. 5 . Ephesians 4:12-13 says, "Unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at a full-grown man." Without growth, there is no building up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more we grow, the more we are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are fully grown, then the building will be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, God's growth and mingling in us are God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THERE BEING NO BUILDING WITHOUT THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brothers and sisters, this principle is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today many in the church are short of the building mainly because they do not have enough growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Too many Christians are without adequate growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We often meet some brothers and sisters who have the life of God in them, yet there is no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes when we meet such a one, we even wonder if he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet he truly has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has confessed that he is a sinner and has received the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Indeed, his sins have been forgiven, and he has the life of the Lord in him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, he has no growth, no progress.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today he is exactly the same as he was five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We sometimes refer to someone being an "old child."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is an "old child"?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A child who is one year old is not an "old child," but after ten years he still looks like a one-year-old, then he is an "old child."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And after twenty years if he is still so small, then he is an "old child" even more.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are too many "old-child" Christians among the brothers and sisters!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes we see a believer who looks like a newly saved one, but when we inquire a little bit, we are surprised that he has already been saved for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is as immature as he was twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such a one is an "old-child" Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One thing is certain Christians who have no growth have never been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you met such a one twenty years ago, he was either blaming this brother for being wrong or criticizing that sister for being improper.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, twenty years later, when you see him again, he still has no other topic except the mistakes and defects of others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This proves that he has not grown one bit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a result, we cannot see any building in him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Such a person who is without growth and building is surely a peculiar member in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You sense that he is not a stone built into the house but a stone lying beside the house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is individualistic, secluded, and unable to be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, he is a member who is detached from the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, in the church he is as round, shiny, and slippery as a marble and therefore cannot be blended with others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I surely have met brothers and sisters like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This condition is due to the lack of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Experience tells us that as long as you have a little growth in life, you can love the brothers and sisters and bear with them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way you will be able to be with others in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If in your eyes none of the brothers are good or lovable, this shows that you lack the element of God within you and are short of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This also shows that you have not been eating, drinking, and enjoying God for a prolonged period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE BUILDING BEING WITH THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank God, however, that although man has so many difficulties, God still will do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may refuse to grow, but God has a way to make us grow.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, someone may suddenly be hit by a car and knocked to the ground while riding a bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This accident may result in an injury that is not too serious but not insignificant either.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a result, while this person is lying in the hospital, he will begin to have a desire for God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At this moment spontaneously he will open his inner being a small crack to let God in. On his bed he will pray and ask for the Lord's forgiveness, thus restoring his fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He may be sorrowful and even weep while he prays, yet within he will also feel sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As this is happening the element of God within him will increase a little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At that time, not only will he love God, but he will also love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>While he is lying on the hospital bed, he will look forward to seeing the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If some brothers and sisters come to visit him, instead of feeling disgusted with them, he will feel that all of them are lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All of them will be blended and become inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Dear brothers and sisters, we have to see, therefore, that the real building comes from growth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more growth there is, the more building there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Worldly people form associations and join themselves together, but this is absolutely not what we mean by being built together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our being built together is altogether by the life we have in common.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When this life grows in you and also in me, then we grow together with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The more you grow in this life, the more you will love your brothers and sisters and be joined to them, even glued together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you and your brothers and sisters are glued together, it will be impossible to be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, building comes from growth.</S>
