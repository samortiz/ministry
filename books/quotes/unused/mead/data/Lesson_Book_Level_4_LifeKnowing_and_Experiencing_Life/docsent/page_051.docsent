   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Knowing and dealing with the world is very important in the initial experience of our Christian life; therefore, we shall study it carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIN AND THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The contamination of sin and of the world differ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The contamination of sin is savage, rough and ugly, while the contamination of the world is cultured and refined, often appearing beautiful in the sight of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The contamination of sin is like a splash of mud or black ink on a white shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the contamination of the world is like a colorful pattern printed on the white shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world appears better than sin, but when related to purity, both are contaminating and require dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The damage caused by sin and the world upon man differ greatly: sin contaminates man, whereas the world both contaminates and possesses man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is far more serious for man's life to be possessed by the world than to be contaminated by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sin is the primitive, superficial, and initial step of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The world is the final, serious and last step of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people stress only victory over sin, but the Bible stresses even more the overcoming of the world 1 John 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need even more to overcome the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we desire to grow in life and be gained by the Lord, we must make an effort to deal with the world that enslaves us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE FORMATION OF THE WORLD A. Man's Need</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible divides man's needs into three main categories: provision, protection, and pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to maintain his existence, he needs not only the various provisions, such as clothing, food, etc., but also a means of defense to protect himself from being hurt and a form of amusement for his happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the entire need for human living is included in these three all-embracing categories.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Prior to the fall, God was responsible for providing for these three needs of man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First, before man was created, God had made provision for all necessities of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Adam was in the garden of Eden, various kinds of fruit and vegetables, water, air, sunshine, and a place for shelter were provided.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second, protection or defense was also God's responsibility in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, man needs self-protection and self-defense, but in the beginning God Himself was his defense and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When man is under God's care, he can escape any attack or danger.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Third, pleasure was also God's responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people think that amusement is sinful, but this concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Happiness is essential to human life and is found in amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food'' Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All the trees in the garden of Eden not only bore fruit for food, but were also pleasing and enjoyable to the eye, making one happy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God not only prepared this happy environment; at the same time He Himself was the joy of man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If man has God as his enjoyment, then man's joy is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the beginning these three great needs supply, defense and amusement were planned and prepared for by God.</S>
