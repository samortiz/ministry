Then he was established by God as king with his kingdom exalted for the sake of God's people Israel (vv. 6-25). David's care for God's habitation on the earth is seen in his taking care of the habitation of the ark of God (ch. 6) and in his wanting to build a house for God (ch. 7). Chapters eight through ten are concerned with David's conquest over his enemies for the strengthening of his kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. OVER THE PHILISTINES</H2><P>David struck the Philistines and subdued them, taking control of the chief city out of the hand of the Philistines (8:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. OVER MOAB</H2><P>David struck Moab, putting their grown-up ones to death and keeping their younger ones alive. The Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute to him (v. 2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. OVER ZOBAH AND SYRIA</H2><P>In his conquest over Zobah and Syria (vv. 3-8), David struck Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, and took from him 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers. When the Syrians of Damascus came to help the king of Zobah, David struck 22,000 men among the Syrians. The Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. From this we see that "Jehovah preserved David wherever he went" (v. 6b).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_134.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_136.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Samuel &nbsp; pg 135</div><br></body></html>
