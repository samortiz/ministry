<h2 class="head2">F. The Means of Renewing</h2><h2 class="head3">1. By the Renewing Spirit</h2><p>We are renewed by the Spirit (Titus 3:5). Renewing is by the renewing Spirit mingling with the believers&rsquo; regenerated spirit indwelt by Christ as one spirit to spread into the believers&rsquo; mind (Eph. 4:23) to renew their entire being as a member of the new man.</p><h2 class="head3">2. By the Believers&rsquo; Walking in the Newness of Life</h2><p>We, the regenerated saints, as parts of the new man and as God&rsquo;s new creation should walk in the newness of the divine life in resurrection (Rom. 6:4).</p><h2 class="head4">a. Putting Off the Old Man</h2><p>In order to be renewed by the mingled spirit, the renewing Spirit mingled with the believers&rsquo; regenerated spirit, the believers need to put off their old man, that is, renounce and deny their old self (Eph. 4:22; Matt. 16:24). To deny the self and bear the cross is to apply the cross to the self.</p><h2 class="head4">b. Putting On the New Man</h2><p>The believers also need to put on the new man, that is, apply what Christ has accomplished in creating the new man, by living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Eph. 4:24; Phil. 1:19-21). Whereas the cross is for the putting off of our old man, the Spirit is for the putting on of the new man. To put on the new man we need the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Through Consuming</h2><p>Renewing takes place through the consuming by the believers&rsquo; environmental suffering (2 Cor. 4:16). This suffering kills the believers&rsquo; outer man and renews their inner man day by day. Human life is more a life of suffering than a life of enjoyment. Much of the believers&rsquo; environmental suffering is related to their family life, to their daily life with their spouse, children, and relatives. Our environment is according to God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, and we cannot escape it. God arranges our environment so that little by little and day by day our outer man will be consumed and our inner man will be renewed.</p><h2 class="head2">H. The Believers Needing to Be Renewed</h2><p>The believers must be thoroughly and absolutely renewed that they may be practically the genuine new creation of God and for God (Gal. 6:15).</p><h2 class="head2">I. To Be as New as the New Jerusalem</h2><p>The believers should be renewed to be as new as the New Jerusalem since they all will be the consummating part of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). Nothing of the old creation can be brought into the New Jerusalem. Since the New Jerusalem will be constituted with the believers, they need to be thoroughly and absolutely renewed.</p>
