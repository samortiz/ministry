   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Rest in the Enjoyment of Christ's</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Riches in Life 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ceasing from Labor and Resting</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in the Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of Christ's Life</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we come to the heart of my burden in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 11 says, "Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all must bind our donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I hope that this saying will become a proverb among us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible a donkey is an animal used for transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The prophet Balaam traveled by means of a donkey Num 22:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem shortly before His crucifixion, He also rode upon a donkey Matt 21:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the Bible, a donkey is always used for traveling toward a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To tie a donkey to something indicates that the journey is over, that you have arrived at your destination, and that you have reached your goal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To bind a donkey is not a negative thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Any donkey would be happy to be bound to a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A donkey's labor is to travel to a certain destination with a certain goal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What a meaningful picture we have in 49:11!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the worldly people today are donkeys traveling, striving, laboring, and journeying to reach their goal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without one exception, all Christians are also journeying, striving, and laboring donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I certainly used to be like this when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was striving to overcome sin with the goal of one day becoming an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That was my destination, my goal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I continued my striving until the day I saw the vision of binding my donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I saw that there was no need for me to labor or travel to reach my destination because I had already come to my destination and I had already reached my goal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our destination is the vine, the living Christ who is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must bind our donkey to this vine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we must cease our labor and our striving and rest in Christ, the living One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose a brother tells you of his desire to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Holiness is his goal, and the holy country is his destination.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He tells you that he is striving and endeavoring to reach this goal; he is laboring to be filled with holiness and to dwell in the holy country.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What would you say to this brother?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should say, "Brother, bind your donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no need for you to labor and strive to reach the goal of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is the vine, the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is so rich in life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Bind your donkey to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that you must cease your striving and rest in the rich, living Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose another brother, recently married, says to you, "Brother, as one in the Lord's recovery, I want to live a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My wife is a great test to me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Day and night I am striving to keep from being angry with her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My goal is never to lose my temper with my wife."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What would you say to this brother?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Firstly, you must be one who has had the experience of binding your donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After you have experienced this yourself, others may come to you with their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When they do, you should say, "You need to bind your donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Cease from your labor and your striving.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is no need for you to strive, because Christ has won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The scepter, the kingship, and the kingdom all belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You simply need to rest in Him as the vine."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How often have you heard that you must cease from your striving and simply rest in Christ, the source of life?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe that many of us have done this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But I hope that in the recovery we shall have a new proverb to help us in this matter: Bind your donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This proverb is a proverb of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sisters, why are you still striving?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You need to bind your donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>People used to bind their donkeys to stakes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But we do not bind our donkey to a lifeless stake; we bind it to a vine that is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Just recently I have seen a clear vision concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, hundreds of times in the past I bound my donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I stopped my journeying, ceased my striving, gave up my goal, and forgot my destination.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I could give up my goal because I had already reached it, and I could forget my destination because I had already arrived at it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Holiness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The power to overcome our problems with our wives is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are already in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How foolish it is to continue journeying, striving, and endeavoring!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All such labor is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When I saw this vision, I bound my donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When many young brothers first come into the church life, they are striving donkeys.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the meetings they even compete with the others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But whenever you strive, endeavor, and compete, you are not at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Instead of striving and competing, you should tie your donkey to the vine, which is Christ, the source of life, the One who is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ is not only the vine, but even the choice vine, the very choice source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must stop our labor and rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now we must see how to bind our donkey to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In gaining the victory over the enemy, Christ is the lion.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But to us He is the vine for our satisfaction and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is through His victory that He can be the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If Christ had never won the victory, He could never be the vine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But because the victory is Christ's, He is our vine full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thus, we must cease our labor and be tied to Him and rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As some read this message, they may think that I have gone too far in interpreting these figures to apply to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But if you do not interpret verse 11 in this way, how do you interpret it?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What does it mean to bind your donkey to the vine?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some may say that this is a reference to the riches of the tribe of Judah, that it is a figure showing that the tribe of Judah was so full of wine that even the laboring donkeys could be bound to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But remember that verse 11 is also a picture and an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have seen that according to Revelation 5:5 Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Based upon the principle of interpreting the lion in verse 9 as the victorious Christ, we may say that the significance of binding our donkey to the vine is that we cease our labor at Christ who is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is not an imaginative interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is a proper, genuine, and sound interpretation according to the principle of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We thank the Lord for giving us this proper interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Hallelujah, we have the vine to which we can bind our donkey!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Are you still laboring?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Are you still striving and journeying to reach your goal?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Even the young ones among us must say, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I don't need to labor, strive, or journey.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I simply need to bind my donkey to the vine."</S>
