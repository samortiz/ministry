   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE REPORT OF THE PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BASED UPON THE REVELATION OF JEHOVAH A. The Report of the Prophets and</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>the Revelation of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Isaiah 53:1 says, "Who has believed our report?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>/ And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first half of this verse speaks of a report, and the other half speaks of a revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The revelation equals the recounting in the preceding verse, 52:15.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isaiah's word in 53:1 indicates that the prophets preached the New Testament gospel in the New Testament economy, but no one believed their report.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their report was based upon God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God revealed to them the arm of Jehovah, who is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jesus is the real arm of Jehovah.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a sense, to preach the gospel is an easy thing; actually, however, it is the most difficult thing on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To convince people to believe what we preach concerning Jesus is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we go to speak to people concerning Jesus, we often feel that it is difficult to present such a One to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The preaching of Jesus is in the New Testament economy; it is altogether in God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, there is the need of the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Concerning Christ, the Servant of Jehovah</S>
