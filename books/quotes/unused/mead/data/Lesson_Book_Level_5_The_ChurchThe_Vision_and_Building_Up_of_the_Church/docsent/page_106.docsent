   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HOW TO MEET A. Being Gathered Into the Lord's Name</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 18:20 says, "For where are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most crucial thing in the believers' meeting is to be gathered into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that we have to meet in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since we are the Lord's and were saved by His name, we should gather only into that name and meet in that name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must not gather into and meet in any other name, whether it is the name of an individual, of a corporate body, of a mission, or of a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we meet in His name, we are meeting in His person, because the name denotes the person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So, to meet in His name means to call on His name and to be in spirit where His Spirit dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Meeting with the Basic Factors and Elements The Word, the Spirit, Praying, and Singing</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In all of our meetings there should be four basic factors and elements: the word, the spirit, praying, and singing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we handle these four elements in a proper and living way, there will be a rich display and expression of Christ in all of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word is the holy word revealed in the Scriptures, either the constant Word or the instant word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we are going to be the speaking ones in our meetings, we must let the word of Christ dwell in us richly Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The riches of Christ are in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us that it may operate and minister these riches into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then our speaking of the word in the meetings will be an exhibition of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we refer to the spirit, we are following the apostle Paul to denote our spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the New Testament, the divine Spirit and our human spirit are mingled together as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He that is joined to the Lord, who is the Spirit, is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a regenerated person, the divine Spirit and the human spirit are no longer two separate spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit of the Lord and the spirit as our inward being are one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Christian heritage today is in two things the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have the Word without and the Spirit within, and these two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Word is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I have the Word in my hands it is the Word outside of me, but when I pray-read the Word, it gets into me and becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I speak the Spirit out to you, the Spirit becomes the word, and when you receive this word into you, it becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As I am speaking the word, you are receiving the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the strangest thing is this we are supposed to be the speaking people of the speaking God, yet we do not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to learn how to handle the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My intention and my burden is that the saints would learn how to speak forth Christ properly, to speak in the Spirit and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another basic factor and element in our meetings is prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to learn to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word and the Spirit must issue in our praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our meetings there should be many prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, our church meetings need to be full of spontaneous and living prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We offer too many religious, duty-fulfilling prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our prayers are not that spontaneous, real, genuine, or true.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are not that much in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not plan what to pray ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our prayers should come out of us spontaneously in the way that we breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our meetings are dead because we are short of these living, spontaneous prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Another basic factor and element in our meetings is singing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both speaking and singing are the issue of the infilling of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are filled in our spirit something will flow out of us in speaking and singing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Ephesians 5:18-19, Paul tells us to "be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.''</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The meetings of the church are crucial to God, the church, ourselves, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without the meetings, there can be no practical expression of the church, and the Lord's speaking is restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the meetings, the economy of God is not carried out and the church is not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we must give ourselves to the Lord to be in every meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should never excuse ourselves from the meetings, regardless of the reason; otherwise, we may excuse ourselves from the church life and the kingdom reward.</S>
