<li>JOY OF SALVATION<br /></li>2. "No condemnation!" precious word!<br />36. Redemption, center of my faith<br />84. Jesus, Lord, Thou art my shepherd<br />101.	I know not why God's wondrous grace<br />106.	The saints have heard His words of love<br />111.	By Thee, O God, invited<br />115.	A mind at perfect peace with God<br />116.	O Jesus, Lord, 'tis joy to know<br />120.	Redemption! Oh rejoicing sound<br />124.	Now we are resting in the Lamb<br />147.	Once I was bound by sin's galling fetters<br />160.	Why should I worry, doubt, and fear?<br />181.	I belong to Jesus<br /><br /><li>SPRINGS OF THE VALLEY OF BACA<br /></li>35. In nothing be anxious; the Lord is at hand<br />54. Truth is sacrificed too often<br />80. The battle is not ours to fight<br />81. In some way or other the Lord will provide<br />83. As I am fighting for my Lord<br />86. Amid the trials that I meet<br />87. When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed<br />91. His promises indelible<br />95. O soul, are you weary and troubled?<br />123.	Keep up the song of faith<br />127.	O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore<br />129.	He faileth not, for He is God<br />130.	Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name<br />138.	I'll sing of the wonderful promise<br />139.	God hath not promised skies always blue<br />140.	Lord, it belongs not to my care<br />145.	The cross that He gave may be heavy<br />150.	Pressed out of measure, pressed beyond all length<br />152.	O doubting, struggling Christian<br />153.	There's a little word that the Lord has giv'n<br />154.	Hark! a voice from heav'n proclaiming<br />164.	My will is weak, my strength is frail<br />170.	Weary pilgrim on life's pathway<br />175.	My faith looks up to Thee<br />182.	Though we waver as the seasons<br /><br /><li>UNION WITH CHRIST<br /></li>28. Joined to the Christ victorious<br />29. Lord, Thou hast shown the mystery<br />34. Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too<br />45. Though Christ a thousand times<br />46. O Golgotha! Good Golgotha!<br />47. I am crucified with Christ<br />77. Crucified with Christ my Savior<br />79. Crucified was my Lord Jesus<br />102.	One with Thee, Thou Son eternal<br />146.	Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine<br /><br />
