<h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to our dear Sister X:</p><p>We have received special mercy from the Father and are in a peaceful situation. Whenever we think of the brothers who are fleeing from the war, we can only pray desperately for them before the Father. May the Father of mercies, the God of grace and mercy, shorten the days for the sake of His chosen people so that His children might be kept safe and at peace, living their lives in godliness. We enclose a money order from the Communication Bank for X dollars. Please distribute X dollars for us to the brothers and sisters who are in need. X dollars are for your personal use. The remaining X dollars are for Mr. X. May the Lord repay you for your labor. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Fang-ching, Chai Gi-chen,<br />Hsie Tse-shun on behalf of the brothers<br />meeting in the Lord's name in Swatow<br />January 20</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Here is a postal money order for X dollars. Please acknowledge the receipt. This was offered by a Christian to the Lord. The offerer's prayer was written on the envelope. It clearly said that it should be sent to P. O. Box 84, Hankow. We are just obeying the Lord's will and doing what the offerer prayed in sending the entire amount to you. Please distribute it in the Lord according to different needs. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Chen Fang-ching, Chai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun on behalf of the brothers meeting in the Lord's name in Swatow.<br />February 1<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Chungshan, Kwangtung Province</h2><p>Greetings to Sister Lee:</p><p>By the Lord's grace I am still in Chungshan learning to serve and draw near to Him. The brothers and sisters here need edification. You know deeply that I have always lacked spiritual power. May God change me for His own glory and His great mercy's sake so that I will have the boldness to go on. Please pray for me and give me advice. Thank the Lord for using Sister Kuo to help me. My natural man is not completely dealt with yet, so there is still much friction. I really want the Lord to hold me tightly and to tie me up. My future and the time I will return to Hong Kong are all in the Lord's hands. I am waiting for the Lord's clear leading and arrangement. Please greet Miss Chang and Miss Wang for me. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little sister,<br />Ro-chen<br />January 22</p>
