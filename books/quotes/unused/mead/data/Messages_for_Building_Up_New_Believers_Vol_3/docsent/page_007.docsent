   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Choosing the Recreation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That Matches One s Disposition</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Seventh, recreation has to do not only with physical fitness but also with one s disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a person is doing what he likes to do, he tends to be more mentally relaxed and psychologically happy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Doing something that you do not enjoy doing is a labor; it is not a recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some sisters love flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you ask them to water flowers for half an hour, they show no sign of fatigue, even though the same task may tire others out.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before they do it, they may be quite tense, but after they work, they feel relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, if you ask a person who has an aversion for flowers and who hates gardening to water for half an hour, this will be a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, recreation is related to disposition as well.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In choosing a certain form of recreation, you must choose the kind of activity that will relax your nerves and calm your mind, like the examples we have just mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Everyone has some kind of recreation that suits him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Gardening is a recreation to some; to others, it is not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some like dogs and cats, while others are nervous and fearful when they are around them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must find something we like.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These things will enhance our work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Asking me to go to the sea would not be recreational to me, but a river does provide recreation to me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some brothers are different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The stronger the waves, the better it is for them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are happy to see a boat tossing back and forth in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These are things they like, and they are happy when they do them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such activities refresh their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This has to do with disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must choose the kind of recreation that matches your disposition so that it will restore your physical strength.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you choose something which goes against your disposition, you will feel tired and will not want to continue with it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>H. Taking Note Not to Stumble Others</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eighth, as Christians, we must be an example to others in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not want to be a stumbling block to others even in the matter of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We live for the Lord as well as for the brothers; we do not live for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must not care just for ourselves and neglect others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not complain saying, Why must they look at me?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who will they look at if they do not look at you?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, they will look at you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a city is built on a hill, who will not see it?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, others will see it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No matter what our conviction is, we must take care of our influence on the young brothers when they see us doing what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must ask whether the things we do will stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are children of God; we have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must have sensitive feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must realize that we are responsible to God as well as to many young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not pose a problem if someone thinks that he can eat meat, but if his eating stumbles a brother, he should not eat.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not wrong for him to eat meat, but it is wrong if his eating stumbles others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same way, it is not wrong to have recreation, but it is wrong to stumble the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must consider what the weak ones will think about the many things that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not want to be a stumbling block to the weak ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord did not say that we should not be a stumbling block to the strong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, He said we should not be a stumbling block to the weak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are many whose conscience is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They think that they should not go to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to take care of the weak conscience of the brother, I will not go to the temple, even though I know that idols are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the light of this principle, we should not engage in any recreation that will stumble a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What should you do if you are peaceful in your conscience about something, but someone else is not?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You must take care of more than the peace in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must remember that someone else s conscience will be bothered by your action.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You must refrain from the things that stumble him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not enough to say that you will not be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Remember that others may be stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not enough to say that your conscience is at peace; you must remember that someone else s conscience may not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not say, This will not lead me to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Remember that others could sin because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You may not have any problem with this matter, but others may have a problem with it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to turn away from many kinds of recreation for the sake of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must see that many things are lawful but not all things are expedient.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, we must be very careful with our conduct, the more careful the better.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must always learn to take the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must learn to walk carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We allow our brothers and sisters to have some recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Recreation is permissible, but sometimes this recreation may stumble others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If this happens, it is better not to do such things at all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must be careful especially with those who easily come under bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some are easily affected; they easily come under bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must be careful with them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people fall easily.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we are a little careless with them, they will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is why we must pay attention to this matter.</S>
