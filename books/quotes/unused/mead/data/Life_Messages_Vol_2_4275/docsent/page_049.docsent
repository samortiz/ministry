   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MYSTERY ONCE HIDDEN NOW REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The mystery of the universe, Paul tells us, has been hidden "from the ages" Eph 3:9 and was not made known "in other generations" 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that it was hidden from eternity the ages and from the earlier generations of time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even the angels did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nor did Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, or even the wise Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah and the other prophets were in ignorance of this mystery too, as was John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This mystery was hidden in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He alone knew about it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not insignificant that today this mystery has been made known.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know about it from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet, sad to say, even many Christian teachers and scholars do not see this mystery, in spite of their having read through the Bible perhaps a good number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is possible to see the black and white letters without seeing the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul uses a variety of terms to convey what this mystery, now revealed, is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He refers to it as economy, dispensation, purpose, will, pleasure, desire, and intent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To say that Christ is the mystery of God is to say that He is God's definition and explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is unknown, but Christ is His expression and embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yes, Christ is God; He is also God's description and embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apart from Him we cannot find God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the problem of our Jewish friends.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They put Christ aside, yet insist they have God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They do not have God, because He can only be realized in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE TRINITY A MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Trinity has been a puzzle to Christian scholars since the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in the first chapter of Genesis we find the Trinity hinted at.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word God in Hebrew is in plural number, not singular.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in verse 26 the three pronouns referring to God are plural: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How could the one God refer to Himself as "us"?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why does He use a plural possessive "our"?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This problem has bothered the scholars for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Threefold Name</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us come to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day after His resurrection, just before He ascended to the heavens, the Lord Jesus met with His disciples on a mountain in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There He charged them to go and "disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Notice that the Three are here, yet "name" is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is something of a mystery about this name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</S>
