<h2 class="head1">FIVE MATTERS IN LEADING THE YOUNG PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In our fellowship concerning how to lead the young people, we need to look at five matters. First, the serving ones should focus on the material and skills needed in the work with the young people. We should study and discuss the material to use in the young people&rsquo;s meeting and whether the material that we used in the past is appropriate and practical. If a businessman wants to manufacture a good product, he must conduct substantial research in order to have the proper skills to make a product. Similarly, we need to study and find the most effective way to work with the young people. This cannot be worked out in a short period of time. We need to study together and experiment in various places to see whether a particular way is practical and effective. Then we should follow up with more study and improvement.</p>
<p>Second, we need materials, including outlines, sections, and lines of study. We hope that the serving ones will consider the matter of materials thoughtfully and use them in a flexible way after digesting and assimilating them. Third, the serving ones must learn some hymns, because there is a need to lead the young people to sing in the meetings. Hence, the serving ones must familiarize themselves with the hymns that the young people sing. Fourth, the serving ones must pray much for the young people. Fifth, the serving ones must learn to blend together in spirit. When we come together, we should not behave as if we were sitting in a meeting of a secular academic organization, waiting for others to speak and taking notes. Every meeting should be an opportunity to fellowship and blend in spirit. We should be free to open our spirit and fellowship our feelings and problems. When we pray, we should release our spirit without hesitation. We should learn these five matters in order to lead the young people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BRIEF HISTORY OF<br />
THE YOUNG PEOPLE&rsquo;S WORK AMONG US</h2>
<p>The young people&rsquo;s work among us began in 1935 or 1936. Before 1936 there was not much work with the young people. In 1932 Watchman Nee went to Tsinan, the capital of Shantung Province, and preached the gospel to a group of medical students at Cheloo University, and many were saved. Shortly thereafter, a group of believers began to meet in Tsinan. This was the first time that there was a work among the young people. However, the scope of the work was not big, because it was limited to the medical school in Tsinan.</p>
<p>In 1936 we began to work more aggressively with the young people in Beijing. Before the Japanese army invaded China, the top educational center was in Beijing, where the largest number of students and the best universities were located. At that time the Lord opened a door to some of the best universities in Beijing. The first door opened to us was at Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). At that time, PUMC was a renowned medical school in the world. Many of the nurses there were sisters, and some students and doctors also began to meet with us. At the same time two very good national universities, Tsinghua and Yenching, were also opened to us by the Lord. From that time onward, I began to bear a substantial burden for the young people&rsquo;s work. Later the work continued to spread among the young people. However, the work was mainly among vocational nursing schools, and there were quite a number of nurses among us who were sisters. In Tientsin, Tsinan, Shanghai, Nanking, and Soochow, nursing students were the main target of our work among the young people.</p>
<p>From 1946 through 1948 the young people&rsquo;s work in Shanghai expanded and became more solid. At that time there were quite a number of young brothers studying in Chiao-tung University. In addition to this school, there were students at Shanghai Medical College and the National Defense Medical Center in Shanghai. The Lord also opened the door to Central University, and many were brought to salvation. In this way we gained experience and knowledge concerning how to choose the right material and how to apply the proper skills.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE YOUNG PEOPLE&rsquo;S WORK<br />
HAVING A BRIGHT FUTURE</h2>
<p>After we came to Taiwan, the brothers began to work with the young people. In the beginning I was with the brothers in their fellowship. As I became busy with other matters, however, I was not involved in the young people&rsquo;s work very much. In recent years the young people&rsquo;s work in Taipei has developed, and the burden for the work has increased greatly. Therefore, the elders feel that we should consider the needs in this work.</p>
<p>Whenever I go abroad, whether to Manila or Hong Kong, and wherever there is a large local church, I encourage them to pay more attention to the young people&rsquo;s work. In recent years many young people have been gained by the Lord in Manila. The situation in Hong Kong is also good. During this past winter, the number in the young people&rsquo;s meeting in Hong Kong reached nearly three hundred. The church in Hong Kong is smaller than the church in Taipei; nevertheless, they have gained over two hundred fifty students. The church in Hong Kong continues to preach the gospel to young people because gaining students has a long-term effect. Once a student is gained, the growth can be endless. When a student is gained, he can gain two or three of his fellow students, and these two or three can gain some as well. Thus, the number can continue to multiply. Furthermore, when young people are gained by the Lord, they also affect their families.</p>
<p>All the serving ones know that there is a bright future in the young people&rsquo;s work. The young ones who are fifteen years old now will be very useful in ten years. Then after another ten years, some who are thirty-five will be ready to be elders in the church. The future is unlimited. The Chinese have a saying that the young generation holds a vast potential for greatness; this is surely true. The saints who are in their fifties are often set in their ways; it is not so easy for them to change. The young people, however, can be raised up relatively quickly to be productive. This is the reason we should pay attention to the young people&rsquo;s work.</p>
