   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JAMES MESSAGE THREE PRACTICAL VIRTUES OF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION 3 Scripture Reading: James 1:13-27 A BALANCED VIEW OF THE EPISTLE OF JAMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After studying Paul s writings and all the Life-study Messages on these writings, we shall no doubt be influenced to receive the light concerning God s economy and to be strongly for it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But there is the possibility that we may be careless in our behavior or that we may neglect the matter of practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we need the balance provided by the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Luther said that the Epistle of James was an epistle of straw.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In saying this, Luther was both unfair and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to realize that after the revelation in Paul s writings concerning God s economy, God put in the book of James, one of the seven books of the New Testament that was not fully recognized until the council of Carthage in A.D. 397.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Prior to that time, there was uncertainty whether this Epistle should be considered part of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, the book of James was recognized as part of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A Balancing Word</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A striking characteristic of the Epistle of James is that it indicates that we may be very strong in God s economy, yet may not be complete and entire in our Christian behavior in our personal daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of us can testify that we have seen the vision concerning God s economy and that we are absolutely for this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, we still need to pay attention to our behavior in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A brother may easily become angry with his wife, or a sister may not have the proper attitude toward her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such a case, both the brother and the sister are neither complete nor entire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is an illustration of the fact that we need the balancing word found in the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Strong Warning</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In addition to providing balance, the Epistle of James also serves as a strong warning that it is possible to be very godly and yet not be clear concerning the vision of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to church history, James was noted for living a godly life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One account says that James spent so much time kneeling in prayer that his knees became calloused.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>James certainly was a godly man, a man of prayer, and prayer is emphasized in his Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, James may not have had a clear view concerning the distinction between grace and law; that is, he may not have had a clear view regarding God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In his writings there are hints that this was the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, his Epistle is notable and remarkable concerning Christian conduct and emphasizes practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this reason, in 1:4 James indicates that the believers should be complete and entire, lacking in nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is only fair to point out that in the book of James we have both a balance and a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need this book.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, there would be a gap, a lack, in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is important that we do not have an unbalanced view of the Epistle of James.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, we need to see that this Epistle indicates that James may have lacked a clear view of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, this book points out the need for practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, fourteen were written by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Epistles of Paul are concerned with God s economy, God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This economy is vital and crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in order to carry out God s economy, we need practical Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we should not be careless in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may use a soldier in the army as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The main responsibility of a soldier is to fight for his country.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in order to be a good fighter, a soldier needs to be proper in his personal daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, although we may be soldiers, fighters, for God s economy, we still need to be complete and entire in our daily Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Position of James</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The place of the book of James is indicated by its position in the arrangement of the books of the New Testament: it comes immediately after the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Epistles of Paul from Romans to Hebrews all cover the major subject of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may liken these Epistles to the main entrance to a building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We then may liken the Epistle of James to a little door near this entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the entrance of Paul s Epistles is crucial, we still need the door of the Epistle of James.</S>
