The living that the Lord Jesus had while He was on earth was the living of the divine life mingled with the human life. Although this wonderful Jesus had His human life, He did not live by that human life; rather, He lived by God as His life. When this man spoke, He did not speak by His own life but by God&#8217;s life (John 7:16-17; 12:49-50; 14:24). When this man worked, He did not work by His own life but by God as His life (5:17, 19; 10:25; 14:10b). The first few books of the New Testament reveal a wonderful, real man living on this earth not by His own life but by God as His life. This is the living of Jesus, which is the fifth main item mentioned in the four Gospels.<p>The entire Gospel of Matthew shows us that with the living of Jesus there was the kingdom of God and the real submission to God. The kingdom of God was brought in to exercise God&#8217;s authority because there was a person who was completely submissive to God&#8217;s authority.<p>The Gospel of Mark shows us the living of Jesus as one who was fully obedient to God.<p>The Gospel of Luke shows us the living of a very proper, normal man. Such a man was absolutely separated, holy, toward God; He was righteous with Himself, being wrong with others in no way; and He was always peaceful, kind, and good toward others.<p>In the Gospel of John we see the living of Jesus as the living of a human life mingled with the divine life. Man and God, God and man, are mingled together to live, to walk, and to work as one.<p>In summary, the Gospel of Matthew shows us a living which brings in the exercise of God&#8217;s authority and causes people to submit to His authority in a full way. In the Gospel of Mark we find a person who lives a life in absolute obedience to God to serve God&#8217;s will and His purpose. Luke&#8217;s Gospel presents the Lord Jesus as a proper, normal person who is wrong in no way with God, with Himself, and with others. Jesus could be such a perfect man because He had this kind of living. The Gospel of John shows us a human life mingled with the divine life. These two lives live, walk, work, think, and do things together. In everything, these two lives are one.<h2 class=head1>THE MASS REPRODUCTION OF THE GOD-MAN</h2><p>Such a wonderful God-man, a man with God living in Him, needs to be duplicated and reproduced. This is the sixth major item in the New Testament. For this purpose, He needs to impart Himself into many others. In this way, Christ may be likened to a stencil for copying. Everything of the Lord is composed as a stencil in order to be duplicated and reproduced. Such a man with such a wonderful life and living must be duplicated in the way of mass reproduction.<h2 class=head2>One Grain Becoming Many Grains</h2><p>This man with such a living is likened to a grain of wheat that is multiplied (John 12:24). The way in which this grain of wheat is multiplied is by death and resurrection. By His death and resurrection, Christ imparted Himself into all His believers (20:22; 1 Pet. 1:3). The one grain of wheat after death and resurrection became many grains. This is the imparting of Christ into us. At the beginning of the four Gospels Christ was the only begotten Son of God (John 3:18), the one grain of wheat, but at the end of the Gospels Christ became the Firstborn among many brothers (20:17), the first of many grains. The one grain became many grains because He imparted Himself into many others.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
