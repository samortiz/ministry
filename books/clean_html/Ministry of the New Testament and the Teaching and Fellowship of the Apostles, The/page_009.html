<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>All the Above Teachings Are God's Speaking<br>in the Son at the Last of These Days,<br>Which Should Be Universally Taught<br>Everywhere in Every Church in the Same Way</H2><P>All the above teachings are God's speaking in the Son at the last of these days (Heb. 1:2), which should be universally taught everywhere in every church in the same way (1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Excluding:</H2><P>However, we need to be careful because in the universe not only God speaks, but another one, Satan, who is competing with God, also speaks. Therefore, we must know what is excluded from the teaching of the apostles as God's speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teaching of Judaism</H2><P>The teaching of Judaism should be excluded from the teaching of the apostles in the New Testament (Gal. 1:6-9; 1 Tim. 1:3-8). The speaking of God in the Old Testament concerning the law is good, but we should not include this speaking in the New Testament. Eventually, the teaching of the law became an "ism"&#151; Judaism. In the Old Testament Moses spoke very much concerning the law, but in the Epistles of the New Testament the teaching of the law is prohibited.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teaching of Gnosticism</H2><P>The teaching of Gnosticism also should be excluded from the teaching of the apostles (Col. 2:4, 8). Gnosticism was a mixture of Jewish, oriental, and Greek philosophies. The Gnostics attempted to bring their philosophy into the church and mix it with the teachings of the New Testament. Thus, Gnosticism became a mixture of three elements: Judaism, Christian teaching, and heathen philosophy. It is very strongly prohibited and condemned by the apostles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teaching of Asceticism</H2><P>The teaching of asceticism is included in Gnosticism. In the New Testament the teaching of asceticism also is prohibited (Col. 2:16-18, 20-23). These three "isms"&#151;  Judaism, Gnosticism, and asceticism&#151;are very strongly excluded by the apostles in their writings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Holy and Divine, as the Old Testament Is</H2><P>The teaching of the apostles in the New Testament is holy and divine, as the Old Testament is (2 Pet. 3:15-16). The Old Testament was considered by God as holy and divine, and God charged His people in the Old Testament not to speak His word in a wrong way (Deut. 18:20). God's people were to consider His speaking in the Old Testament as the holy word, the divine speaking, and God's oracle.</P><P>After Paul wrote his fourteen Epistles, Peter in his second Epistle charged the churches to regard Paul's writings as the holy and divine writings of God, just as the Old Testament writings are. In 3:15-16 Peter said that Paul's writing is full of wisdom and that some twist Paul's writings, "as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction." Here Peter appreciated Paul's writings, saying that they are equivalent to "the rest of the Scriptures."</P><P>For Peter to make such a commendation of Paul's writings is not a small thing, for it was he who was rebuked to his face by Paul regarding the New Testament faith (Gal. 2:11-21). It is difficult to find one Christian who would appreciate someone who has rebuked him. For this reason, many saints have learned to be "wise" in not rebuking others for their mistakes. Including the elders, very few in the church life today speak the truth concerning others' mistakes. Thus, many things in the recovery are still in darkness because no one dares to rebuke anyone. In contrast, Peter and Paul were very frank and strict.</P><P>Paul became an apostle after Peter did. Peter was a top apostle while Paul was still Saul, persecuting the saints and blaspheming Jesus. Later, Paul was saved and was brought by Barnabas to fellowship with the apostles at Jerusalem (Acts 9:27). Shortly after that, Peter received a vision from the heavens three times, in which a great sheet full of unclean animals descended from heaven, and the Lord charged him, "Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!" (10:9-16). Peter responded, "By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common and unclean." Then the Lord said to him, "The things that God has cleansed, do not make common." The meaning of this vision was that at that time God annulled the Old Testament regulation prohibiting His people from contacting the Gentiles. Based on this vision, Peter began to have contact with the Gentiles. First, Peter went to Cornelius, a Roman centurion of an Italian cohort, to preach the gospel to him and his relatives and intimate friends, all of whom were Gentiles (vv. 17-48). Then, in Galatians 2 Peter was eating with the Gentile believers in Antioch. But when some came from Jerusalem, from James, Peter shrank back and separated himself, fearing those of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews and also Barnabas joined him in his hypocrisy (vv. 12-13). Paul saw this and rebuked Peter to his face in front of all the disciples (v. 14). When I read this, I was very concerned for Peter. I thought that from that time onward Peter would never be happy with Paul. But in my early days of reading the Bible I found out that in 2 Peter 3:15-16 Peter highly appreciated Paul's writing, even charging the saints to regard Paul's writing as holy and divine as the Old Testament.</P>
