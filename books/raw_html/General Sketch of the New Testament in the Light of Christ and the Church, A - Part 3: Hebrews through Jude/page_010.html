<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>CHRIST’S NEW COVENANT SUPERIOR TO THE OLD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Heb. 8:1-3, 6, 10-12; 9:14-17; 10:19-25</h1><p>As we have seen, Hebrews is not easy to read and understand. In these messages we will present the most important points. This will help us to understand and realize the proper meaning of this book.<h2 class=head1>A COMPARISON BETWEEN CHRIST AND JUDAISM</h2><p>Hebrews deals with the difference between Judaism and Christ. Judaism is a religion which was established and ordained by God in order to present a set of types, pictures, and shadows to illustrate the real, heavenly, spiritual, and eternal things. These spiritual matters are difficult for the human mind to comprehend, so we need pictures to help us. When children are taught in kindergarten, a teacher often displays pictures and drawings to help them see what they are being taught. Judaism is a set of pictures, shadows, and types set up by God to illustrate the heavenly, eternal, spiritual, and mysterious things.<p>God’s purpose in these spiritual, heavenly, eternal, and mysterious things is twofold. On the negative side, God ordained Christ to be the very One to take away all our sins and redeem us back to God. On the positive side, this very Redeemer by His death, resurrection, and ascension has been wrought into us as our life. By Him, in Him, and with Him we sinners are not only forgiven and redeemed but also related to God by being joined to God and mingled with Him. By this relatedness, this union and mingling, heaven is related to earth and has even been brought into man. Now we are one not only with God but also with the heavens. The is the main thing that God has purposed to do. All the things of Judaism are the shadows, pictures, and types of this, while Christ Himself is the very reality of all these things. The difference between Judaism and Christ is that Judaism is only the shadows and pictures, not the real item. Christ Himself is the real item.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE REALITY OF GOD AND A GENUINE MAN</h2><p>Hebrews 1 tells us that Christ is the very God. He is the expression of God, the mouthpiece of God, the effulgence of God’s glory, and the impress of His substance. Christ is the reality of God. Then, chapter two tells us that this very God was incarnated as a man. By being a man, He uplifted the standard and position of man. He brought God into man by incarnation and brought man into God by resurrection and ascension; that is, by His incarnation, resurrection, and ascension He brought divinity into humanity and humanity into divinity, uplifting humanity into divinity. He is God, the reality of God, and a genuine man.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE APOSTLE SENT BY GOD TO US</h2><p>In chapter three, Christ is the One who was sent by God to us to care for us and bring us out of our fallen condition, just as Moses was sent by God to deliver the children of Israel from their fallen situation in Egypt. Christ also builds us together as God’s house by transferring us from the soul into the spirit. By enjoying Him as our rest and good land in spirit, we are built up together as God’s dwelling place.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE HIGH PRIEST ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHISEDEC</h2><p>Hebrews goes on to tell us that Christ is the High Priest going from us to God. With the high priest there are two aspects because there are two different orders of priests, the order of Aaron and the order of Melchisedec (5:4, 6, 10). Aaron as the high priest typifies Christ as the High Priest for us on the earth. Before His resurrection and ascension, Christ is typified by Aaron the high priest, taking care of our case on the earth. Aaron was the type of Christ as our High Priest to offer sacrifices for us, redeem us from sins, and reconcile us to God. This was the work Christ accomplished while He was on the earth. After His resurrection and ascension to the heavens, however, Christ is still our High Priest but no longer according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchisedec. As such, He has no beginning and no end; He is the eternal One and the One in the heavens (7:3). This is something not on the negative side but very much on the positive side.
