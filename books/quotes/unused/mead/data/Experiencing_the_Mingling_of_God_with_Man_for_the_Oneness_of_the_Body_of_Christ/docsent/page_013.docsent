   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE NEED FOR A LOVING HEART</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND A RECEIVING SPIRIT TO EAT THE LORD Scripture Reading: Matt 5:8; Psa 73:1; Matt 15:8; Psa 51:10; 1 Cor 2:16; Phil 2:5; 2 Cor 3:15-18; Eph 3:16-17, 19b; 2 Cor 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mingling is a very basic concept in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s ultimate intention is to be life and everything to us so that He may mingle Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the time of creation man was made according to the image of God but did not have the life of God Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We were made as vessels of God so that He could be our content, our life, and our everything Rom 9:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must realize that we are merely containers and that the Lord Himself must be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, immediately after man was created, God offered Himself to man in the form of the tree of life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God did not ask, demand, or command man to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, He only intended that man would take Him as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>EATING VERSUS DOING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today there is a concept within us that is absolutely contrary to the thought of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever we think about God, we have the concept that we must do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We think that we have to worship Him, fear Him, do His will, and do good things to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the basic thought of God in the Scriptures is that we would take God as our life in the same way that we take food.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After God created man, He immediately brought up the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time God did not tell Adam to do many different things; instead, He advised Adam to take care of his eating vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God told Adam that he had to eat the proper thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our concept is not one of eating but of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are doing and working Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord s intention, though, is that we would be eating Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should be those who eat and drink, not those who merely do things and work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we eat properly, we will be the proper people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not eat properly, we will not be the right people and will be unable to do what is right.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that God s intention is that we would take Him as food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, we must eat and drink of Christ as our spiritual food and drink John 6:57; 4:10, 14; 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we feed on Christ and drink of Him, He will be everything to us, and we will be the proper people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, we must first pay attention to the matters of eating and drinking, not the matters of doing and working.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If someone came to the Lord, asking, What shall I do? the Lord might answer, You must eat Me and drink Me. I am like a piece of bread; I am the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He who eats Me shall live because of Me John 6:35, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not a question of what we should do but a question of what we should eat and by what we should live.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a matter of doing and working but a matter of eating and living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must eat the Lord in order to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we take the Lord as our food, He can live through us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May we all have a change in our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One time after I had given several messages on this subject, a brother came to me, saying, Brother Lee, the messages have been wonderful, but now that we know that we have to do the Lord s will, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I clearly told him that it is not a matter of doing or working but a matter of eating, drinking, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our responsibility is to eat Christ, drink Christ, and live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible tells us that the Lord is the bread of life and that he who eats Him will live because of Him John 6:48, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, we must eat the Lord and feed on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are also told that the Lord is the living water, the water of life 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, we must also come to Him and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, the Lord is our life, and it is no longer we who live but the Lord Himself who lives within us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to live in the Lord, by the Lord, and for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May we all have a real change in our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must forget about our doing and working and instead deal with our eating, drinking, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once a sister came to me, saying, Brother Lee, I know that as a sister, a wife should submit to her husband, but to tell you the truth, I simply cannot submit to my husband.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Can you tell me what I should do?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I feel so helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I said, It is good to feel helpless.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more helpless you are, the more you are unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who are helpless and dead cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You must forget about doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She said, But what should I do when I go back home?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Again, she was raising up the matter of doing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After some consideration, I said, Let us kneel down and pray together, and when you go back home, the first thing you must do is kneel down to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>She said, Brother Lee, I cannot kneel down and pray to the Lord, because I know that He wants me to submit to my husband, but I do not want to.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How can I go to the Lord and pray to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I said, Just go to the Lord and tell Him what you have told me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Tell Him, Lord, I know that You want me to submit to my husband, but I do not want to.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As soon as this sister contacted the Lord, there was a willingness within her to submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was not her doing; this was the issue of her eating.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She contacted the Lord and was strengthened by Him and satisfied with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because she ate the Lord, she received a little more mingling with the Lord and was able to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the basic thought of the whole Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all must learn to practice eating and drinking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only by eating and drinking the Lord can we take the Lord into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we go to the Lord, contact Him, feed on Him, and drink Him, wonderful things will happen as an issue of our eating and drinking Him.</S>
