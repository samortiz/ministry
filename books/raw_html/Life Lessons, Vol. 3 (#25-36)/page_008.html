 <h2 class="head1">II. THE CONDITIONS<br />
FOR EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Abiding in Him</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;He who abides in Me and I in him...&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:5).</p>
<p>The first condition for experiencing Christ abiding in us is our abiding in Him. We must abide in Him, giving Him the time and space so that He may be able to abide in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Remaining in the Co-crucifixion with Him</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>Moreover, the experience of our co-crucifixion with Christ is also a basic condition for our experience of Christ. Since we are abiding in Him, we are surely remaining in our co-crucifixion with Him, that is, in His all-inclusive death, which nullifies our existence, so that it is no longer we who live. Thus, we allow Christ to live in us that we may experience and enjoy Him as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Loving Him and Keeping His Word</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:23).</p>
<p>Loving Christ and obeying His word are also conditions for us to experience Christ abiding in us. If we love Him and keep His word, He and the Father will come to abide with us that we may enjoy all the blessings of the Triune God abiding with us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Strengthened into the Inner Man</h2>
<p><strong>1) The Father &ldquo;would grant you...to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts...&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:16-17).</p>
<p>Our being strengthened by God with power through His Spirit into our inner man (our spirit) is the condition for our experiencing Christ making His home in our hearts. This experience of Christ is deep, and therefore its condition, which is that our whole being be strengthened by God into our spirit, is weighty.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Having All Boldness</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;With all boldness, as always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:20).</p>
<p>In order to magnify Christ, we must have boldness in all things, not caring for whether we live or die. This is the highest condition for our topmost experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE MEANS OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;For me this shall turn out to salvation through... the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:19).</p>
<p>We do not experience Christ by our ability or by our endeavoring, but through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, who participated in the incarnation, human living, and crucifixion of Jesus and the resurrection, ascension, and glorification of Christ. This Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit, the Spirit who is the ultimate expression of the Triune God. This bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit is the power and means for us to experience Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE ISSUE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Christ Being Formed in Us</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...until Christ is formed in you&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 4:19). The first issue of our experience of Christ is that Christ is formed in us. This refers to Christ growing and maturing in us unto a full stature (Eph. 4:13) that He may be fully expressed through us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. We Becoming God&rsquo;s Full Expression</h2>
<p><strong>1) &ldquo;...Christ may make His home in your heart... that you...may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth [the unlimited dimensions of Christ]...that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:17-19).</p>
<p>The second issue of our experience of Christ is that we become God&rsquo;s full expression. This refers to Christ making His home in us that we may apprehend with all the saints His unlimited dimensions, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God to be the corporate expression of God.</p>
