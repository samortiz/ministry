   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to experience the Lord, we also must be a consecrated person, because the time it takes to grow is long.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Between the time we are regenerated till the time we are matured, we will face many situations that we may not be happy about.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are not clear about consecration and are not consecrated, then we may not be able to finish the course like the apostle Paul 2 Tim 4:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are supposed to run the race, we may run away from situations instead of experiencing life to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we must be properly consecrated in order to go on and grow properly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a normal condition these two experiences, salvation and consecration, are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A saved person should be a consecrated person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once a person is saved, he should consecrate himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be saved without being consecrated is a very abnormal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our gospel work must be done strongly to such an extent that people will immediately consecrate themselves as soon as they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I. THE BASIS OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On what basis must we consecrate ourselves to God?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On what basis does God require us to consecrate ourselves to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to have a basis for whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, when we move into a house and live in it, it is because we have paid a price and rented or bought it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This renting or purchasing is the basis upon which we live there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our God is one who is most legal and one who acts most reasonably.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All His doings are legal and have a basis.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He cannot obtain something in the universe without paying a price, and He also cannot demand something from us without a basis.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God, therefore, demands that we consecrate ourselves to Him, it cannot be without a basis.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this matter, He has a very solid basis, that is, His purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He has already bought us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He can, therefore, demand that we consecrate ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians 6:20 says, "You were bought with a price.''</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our consecration is based on this purchase of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has bought us with none other than the precious blood shed by His beloved Son on the cross 1 Pet 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God used this precious blood as the price to buy us, that we may belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Galatians 4:5 says, "That he might redeem them that were under the law.''</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we became sinners, we fell under God's law and were kept and retained by this law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God, therefore, wanted to release us from under His righteous law, He must pay the full price to satisfy the demand of His law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This price is the precious blood shed by His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Formerly we belonged to the law, but now we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The right of ownership over us has been transferred from the law to the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is on the basis of this transfer of right that God demands that we consecrate ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are clear about the right of ownership, we would consecrate ourselves to God immediately and continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will never dare to think, speak or do things that are not of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We will refresh our consecration every morning and every day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It does not depend on our mood, it is based upon the fact of God's purchase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Each time something occurs that causes us to argue with God, we must bow before Him and say, "Lord, I am the slave You bought.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My right of ownership has been purchased by You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I here and now declare Your right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even in this matter I will let You be the Lord and decide for me.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every time we depart from the position of consecration, we should feel that we are in a state of rebellion similar to that of Onesimus, the slave who fled from his master, Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many of us may still be runaway slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must repent to the Lord right now and consecrate ourselves to Him again or for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we do this, right away we will experience life and grow.</S>
