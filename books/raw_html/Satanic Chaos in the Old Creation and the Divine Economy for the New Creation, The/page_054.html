<P>In chapters one and two, we saw the divine economy and the satanic chaos in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. Then in chapter three we saw the overcomers. We all should say, "If I am a man, I have to be a Christian. If I am a Christian, I have to be an overcomer. If I am an overcomer, I have to prophesy, to speak for the Lord. If I prophesy, I have to open up my mouth. If I open up my mouth, I have to exercise my spirit. If I open up my mouth and exercise my spirit, I speak forth Christ." To speak forth Christ is to exhibit Christ. We all need to fan into flame the gift of God which is within us (2 Tim. 1:6) to be those who speak for the Lord. We should not be those who are hot for only a short time. We need to be burning in spirit all the time (Rom. 12:11). Our burning should be eternal. In order to be the overcomers, we need to cooperate with the Lord to speak Him forth for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:4b).</P><P>After seeing the revelation concerning the overcomers, we saw the truth concerning God's economy in chapter four. In this chapter we want to see the church life in God's economy. The preceding chapters in this book are all directed toward this goal --the church life in God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STANDING OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Many have opposed us because of our stand for the truth that there should be only one church in a locality (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11) as a local expression of the one Body in the universe (Eph. 4:4). There are many so-called churches today, and it seems that people feel the freedom to start a church in the same way that someone would feel the freedom to open a restaurant. But we need to practice the church life according to God's way as revealed in the New Testament. Acts 8:1 speaks of the church in Jerusalem. At that time there were thousands of believers in Jerusalem. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were added to the church there (2:41). Later, five thousand more were added (4:4). Eventually, James told Paul that there were tens of thousands of believers in the city of Jerusalem (21:20). According to Acts 8:1 these myriads of believers were the one church in Jerusalem. Regardless of how many believers there are in a city, they are still the one church in that city. When the church life spread to Antioch, the believers there met as the church in Antioch (13:1).</P><P>Revelation 1:11 says, "What you see write in a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea." John was told to send what he wrote to the seven churches. To the seven churches equals to seven cities --to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. The first to, to the seven churches, equals the seven tos, to the seven cities. This indicates that a church in a certain city should be equal to that city. The practice of the church life in the early days was the practice of having one church for one city, one city with only one church.</P><P>When we say that we are the church in a certain locality, such as the church in Los Angeles, this is not a name but a description of a fact. We are just the church. The church does not have a name just as the moon does not have a name. Once in the Far East, someone was so impressed with the United States that he said even the moon was bigger there. But there is no such thing as an American moon or a Chinese moon. Just as there is one moon, there is only one church. When the moon appears in London, it is the moon in London; when it appears in Los Angeles, it is the moon in Los Angeles. Regardless of where the moon appears, it is still the same moon. Just as there is the moon in Los Angeles and the moon in London, there is the church in Los Angeles and the church in London. There is one church, and this church is manifested or expressed in different localities.</P><P>In the degraded situation today, however, there are many so-called churches. There are churches denominated according to race, such as Chinese churches and Korean churches. There is an Anglican church, an Episcopalian church, in Anaheim, and there are churches representing Taiwan in Anaheim. There are also churches named after the street on which they meet. This shows us the situation of division and confusion today. Even the unbelievers wonder why there are so many divisions among Christians. They may ask, "Since you all have the same Christ and read the same Bible, why are there so many different denominations?"</P><P>I grew up in a city called Chefoo in mainland China. I was educated there and worked there. At a certain point, I gave up my job to serve the Lord full-time. Within a short period of time, the Lord used me to gain a number of people, and I spoke the truth to them concerning the church. There were a number of missionaries in Chefoo at that time, and they were surprised that my preaching was attracting so many people. They were also concerned about my speaking regarding the church being one and the denominations being divisions. I used the illustration of the moon as I did above, pointing out that there is only one church, one Body, expressed in different cities.</P>
