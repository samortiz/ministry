   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>One</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One is the number of God, as Deuteronomy 6:4 says, "The Lord our God is one Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy 2:5 also says, "For there is one God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One is the number that is independent and unique; it does not depend on a second person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This signifies the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One is the number for sufficiency; there is no need for another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This signifies the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One is also the first of all numbers and is the number of the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This signifies God's greatness, that He is the source of all creation and that He is the head of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can get much help by looking at the usage of one in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Exodus 12:2 says that the Passover is in the first month of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This denotes God's way of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The redemption at Golgotha is the beginning of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the first day of creation, light was created; this is God's great power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first book of the Bible is Genesis which speaks of God's power and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Exodus 22:29 says that all the firstborn sons of the children of Israel should be given to Jehovah because they are sanctified unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Exodus 23:19 says that the first of the firstfruits of the land shall be offered to the Lord because the Lord deserves our foremost service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is pitiful that many of God's children still do not know that God is one nor do they consider Him as one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should let Him have the first place in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every word that is mentioned only once in the original text of the Bible is crucial and important.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One also has the meaning of agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Genesis 41:25 says that the dream of Pharaoh is one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This denotes identity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One also has the meaning of peace, as in John 17:11, "They may be one."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This signifies association.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Putting all the aforementioned items together, we can see that one is the mother of all numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, it is the number of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All numbers originate from one, and God is the beginning of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One is the unit that unifies all the numbers; by God all things subsist in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No number can surpass one and be before one, so one represents the absolute God in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the numbers also have their negative meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although the number one primarily refers to God, when it refers to man, there may be some negative connotations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, it refers to man's loneliness and helplessness, or that he is a merciless autocrat, a stiff-necked person, or one unwilling to submit to and depend on others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is three-one and also one-three.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this three-oneness, the Son is the Second.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, two is the number of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It also implies incompleteness and being short of consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord is the second man from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has two natures divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His work is also divided into two sections suffering and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we read Leviticus, we see that when a man commits a sin, he should take two pigeons or two turtledoves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One is for a sin offering and the other is for a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sin offering is for sin; the burnt offering is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This also has two sides God forgives sin and He accepts man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many other records of two pigeons and two turtledoves in Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They signify the Lord Jesus' salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Two is also the number for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus, the Second of the Godhead, is the Savior of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Two also means strengthening, support, and fellowship, as it is written in Ecclesiastes 4:9-12: "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When two different persons testify, their testimonies are true.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please read Deuteronomy 17:6 and 19:15; Matthew 18:16; 2 Corinthians 13:1; and 1 Timothy 5:19.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's testimony to man is incorporated in two Testaments the Old and the New.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The names of the disciples were recorded two by two Matt 10:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the disciples went out to testify, they went out in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The tablets of the testimony of the law are of two pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the great tribulation, there will be two witnesses Rev 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Second of the Godhead is the Word of God Rev 19:13 , the faithful Witness Rev 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In addition, the number two means separation, antithesis, and variance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>For example, the work on the second day of God's creation was to separate the waters from the waters Gen 1:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the unclean beasts entered the ark, they went in two by two Gen 6:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a woman gave birth to a daughter, she was considered to be unclean for two weeks, twice as long as when she had borne a son Lev 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Two has still another meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Two is the number for reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is the first number after something is added to one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, two is not a complete number; it needs the addition of other numbers before it can be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Father and the Son are not a complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They need the Holy Spirit to be added to Them to become three-one and to be the complete God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When a husband and wife become one flesh, in God's eyes, they are not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only when they bear sons and daughters are they a complete family.</S>
