<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Into the Kingdom of God</H2><P>The Lord Jesus said that if you are not born anew, you cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:5). Man cannot enter into the animal kingdom to fellowship with the animals and understand them, because man was not born with the animal life. The animals were born into the animal kingdom. God also has a kingdom. We cannot understand the things of God if we are not in His kingdom. The only way to enter into His kingdom is to be born into it. In our first birth, we were born into the human kingdom. Only man knows the things of man in the human kingdom. The animals cannot know us or understand us. In like manner, how can we understand the things of God in the kingdom of God? The only way is to be born into His kingdom with His life. Now we have been born into the kingdom of God, so we can know God. According to Genesis 1, all of the animals were created according to their kind. But we men were created by God according to God's kind. A "kind" is a kingdom. Later, we were reborn into God's kingdom, into His kind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Washing Away the Filthiness<br>of the Old Nature of Their Old Man</H2><P>Titus 3:5 speaks of the washing of regeneration. Regeneration is a washing. It washes away the filthiness of the old nature of our old man. This washing away is to put off our old man and put on the new man. It is also a kind of reconditioning. We all have been regenerated, reconditioned, with the divine life. Regeneration is very deep. I like this word recondition. Charles Wesley used the word reinstate in stanza 4 of hymn #84 &#151;"Reinstate us in Thy love." We lost our state, our position, so we needed to be reinstated. But we also needed to be reconditioned. Our nature, our essence, and our entire being needed to be reconditioned. Nothing can do this except regeneration. To be regenerated is to be reborn, reconditioned, with the divine life.</P>
