   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Interpretation of the Woman and the Beast</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 7 says, And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast who bears her, who has the seven heads and the ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The picture of the harlot riding on a beast depicts the union of the Roman Catholic Church with the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is religion united and mingled with politics.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 8 continues, The beast that you saw was and is not and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And those who dwell on the earth, those whose name is not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life, will marvel when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will be present.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we have previously seen, the beast is one of the Roman Caesars.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That the beast formerly was, means that before the time of the writing of Revelation inA.D. 90, the beast had been on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By the time this book was written, however, he was not; that is, he already had died.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in the future, he will come up out of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After this one died, his spirit was captured by the enemy, Satan, and kept in the abyss, which is not the same place where the spirits of the dead are presently kept.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, verse 8 says that he will go into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After a certain time, he will perish in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verses 9 and 10 say, Here is the mind which has wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The seven heads are the seven mountains where the woman sits and are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain only a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have wisdom, we can understand that verse 9 refers to the city of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>History tells us clearly that Rome was built on seven mountains; it is even called the city of seven mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time the writer of this book, the apostle John, was not free to write about Rome and the Caesars in plain words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He had to write this book in symbols so he would not be in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The seven heads are the seven mountains, and they are also seven kings, that is, seven Caesars of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>History tells us that there had been twelve Caesars by that time, but verse 10 does not speak of twelve; rather, it speaks of seven particular Caesars.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Fallen in verse 10 is a negative word Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3:25; 2 Sam 1:10, 25, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These seven Caesars had died, or were yet to die, in an unnatural way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first five of them were Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote this book.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sixth, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when this book was written.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, it is said of him that he is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The other, that is, the seventh, had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Revelation 17:11 says, And the beast who was and is not, he himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, the beast is the eighth, but on the other hand, he is out of the seven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This requires wisdom, and students of the Bible have spent much time to find the secret to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the seventh Caesar comes, he will remain a short time and then be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We conclude this from 13:3, which says of the beast, One of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to this verse, Antichrist will be slain and resuscitated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In that resuscitation the spirit of Nero the fifth Caesar will come out from the abyss and enter into the body of the seventh to make him the eighth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, the beast is the eighth, but on the other hand, he is a combination of the body of the seventh and the spirit of the fifth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since 17:11 says that the beast was and is not, and because the number of the name of the beast denotes Caesar Nero 13:18 , we know that Antichrist will be resuscitated by the spirit of Nero, the fifth Caesar, who will enter into the body of the seventh Caesar, thus producing the eighth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the beast is not an ordinary person; he is very extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, he goes into perdition 17:11b ; that is, he will be thrown into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way to put together Revelation 13 and 17, just as we would put together a difficult jigsaw puzzle to get the whole picture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Students of the Bible have spent much time to find out these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>About thirty years ago, D. M. Panton, a good student of the Scriptures, received this light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, he made a big mistake, saying that Mussolini was the seventh Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He even published two photographs together, one of Mussolini and the other of Nero, showing people how much alike they looked.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not try to make predictions such as these.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 12 speaks of ten horns, which are ten kings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are lesser kings which at that time had not received a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the future, they will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast v. 13 . These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them at the battle of Armageddon, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings v. 14a . They who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful, will also overcome them v. 14b . These are the followers of Christ, the ones who have been raptured, who fight the battle against the Antichrist and his army at Armageddon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 15 concludes by interpreting the many waters in verse 1: And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Destruction of the Harlot by the Beast</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verses 16 to 18 say, And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For God has put it into their hearts to perform His mind and to perform one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>During the last three and a half years of this age, the ten kings and Antichrist will agree together to destroy the Roman Catholic Church, the great harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That will be the end of the Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to history, the great city in verse 18 is Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Chapter seventeen is the record of the fall of religious Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The fall of political, material Babylon is seen in chapter eighteen.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to Revelation, the Roman Catholic Church will flourish and prevail until the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 1929 Mussolini signed an agreement with the pope to give the Vatican to the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At that time the Vatican became an independent, religious nation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This helped the Roman Church to become more powerful and more involved in political affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today she is truly flourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is a strong sign and a confirmation that Communism will not prevail throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Communism and Catholicism are the strongest of enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If Communism were to prevail, Catholicism would be ended.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is against the prophecy of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, we should not believe the lies of Communist propaganda.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to prophecy, Catholicism will prosper until Revelation 17 at the end of this age.</S>
