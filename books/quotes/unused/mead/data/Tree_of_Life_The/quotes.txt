[1]  On the sixth day, God created a man in His own image and then committed man with His own authority v. 26 . Image means the expression.
[2]  God created a corporate man in His image to express Himself, so man is the very image, the very expression of God.
[3]  God has an enemy in this universe and on this earth, and this earth has been usurped from the hand of God, robbed away from God.
[4]  The Lord does not want us to consider how to serve Him, how to worship Him, or how to glorify Him, but He wants us to consider Him as our food.
[5]  I hope that the Lord would change your concept from doing to eating.
[6]  If you would become not merely a doing Christian but an eating Christian, that would be wonderful.
[7]  According to the full context of John 4, the Lord s meaning is that to drink of Him as the living water in verse 14 is to worship Him in verse 24.
[8]  The best way to worship the Lord is to drink of Him, to feed on Him, to enjoy Him, to take Him in.
[9]  You have to learn how to take Him in, how to enjoy Him, how to feed on Him, how to drink of Him, and even how to breathe Him in. There is only one way for you to do this learn to open yourself.
[10]  If we would feed on the Lord properly and adequately, drink of the Lord richly and deeply, and breathe the Lord all the time from the depths of our being, we will be so strong in the expression of the Lord and in the representation of the Lord.
[11]  May the Lord bring us into His intention, that is, into the enjoyment of Himself as our life and life supply that we may express Him in His image and represent Him with His authority on the earth.
[12]  OF THE TWO TREES Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7-9; 3:2-7; 4:16-22; 6:3, 5; 7:17-24; 11:1-9; 1 Cor 6:17; Matt 16:22-25; Rev 20:10, 14-15; 21:2; 22:1-2
[13]  It would be a great help to us to see a brief picture of the tree of life throughout the entire Bible.
[14]  On the positive side, there is another line in the New Testament, the line of the mingling of God with the spirit of man.
[15]  We are charged to walk in the spirit, to live in the spirit, to do things in the spirit, to pray in the spirit.
[16]  We have seen that after God created man, He put him in front of the tree of life.
[17]  God s intention was that man would partake of the tree of life, which signifies God in Christ through the Holy Spirit as life to us in the form of food.
[18]  Man did not contact the tree of life, however, because the enemy of God, Satan, came in to seduce man from the tree of life and deceive him to take another source, the tree of knowledge.
[19]  Remember that the entire Old Testament tells us one thing that God first presented Himself as the tree of life to us that we may partake of Him as food and that we may enjoy Him as our life and everything.
[20]  The psalmist says, I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever v. 6 . The temple is not only the dwelling place of God but also a dwelling place to us, God s seeking ones.
[21]  John 14 reveals that the Son is the Father and then goes on to reveal that the Son is the Spirit.
[22]  The Lord tells the disciples that He will ask the Father to give them another Comforter and that this Comforter is the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you v. 17 . The Lord continues in verse 18, I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.
[23]  The very He who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17, becomes the very I who is the Lord Himself in verse 18.
[24]  In John 20 the Lord Jesus came to His disciples after His resurrection, breathed into them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 . The breath out of the Lord is the very Holy Spirit.
[25]  Because we have received Christ, we have been born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God v. 13 . As many as received Christ were born of God.
[26]  Forgive me of all my sins and come into me to be my life, the living air, the breath of life, the Holy Spirit, the very reality of the Triune God incarnated as a man, comes into this person to make his deadened spirit alive and impart the Triune God into his spirit.
[27]  CHAPTER FOUR THE FATNESS OF THE LORD S HOUSE Scripture Reading: Psa 23:6; 36:8-9; 27:4; 84:3, 10; 90:1; S. S. 2:3 GOD S INTENTION FOR MAN TO ENJOY HIM AS FOOD
[28]  When we partake of food, that food becomes a part of us.
[29]  This is the very intention God has toward us, that we may take Him as food so that we can be mingled with Him to express Him in this universe.
[30]  The first mentioning of something in the Scriptures is always a governing principle, a principle which governs all the Lord s dealings with us.
[31]  The basic principle of the Lord s dealings with His people is that they would enjoy Him as their food, their life supply.
[32]  The Gospel of John tells us that one day this very God, who in the beginning presented Himself to man as food, was incarnated as a man.
[33]  God in the form of a man presented Himself to man again as food, as the heavenly bread of life 6:35, 57 , that man may partake of Him.
[34]  Psalm 36:8 says, They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
[35]  We may say that we are satisfied with the Lord, but do we have some experience of being abundantly satisfied with the fatness of the Lord s house?
[36]  Whenever you experience the Lord in such a way as life and as light and as the sweet savor of incense in your prayer to God, you will immediately sense the need of the building up of the Body, of the Lord s house, of the corporate church life.
[37]  When you get into the church life, into the Lord s house, the house of the Lord will bring you back to all the many experiences of Christ and will enrich and strengthen these experiences.
[38]  Today s religious system has distracted us from the enjoyment of Christ.
[39]  Religion has teachings, rules, and rituals for people to worship God, to serve God.
[40]  In today s Christianity there are many teachings and gifts, but the sad thing is that the central thought of God revealed in the Scriptures has been greatly missed and even lost.
[41]  We have to partake of Him and enjoy Him, not just to know Him with a certain amount of objective knowledge but to know Him in our subjective experience.
[42]  CHAPTER FIVE THE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 6:35, 57, 63; 7:37; 8:12; 9:5; 11:25; 1 Cor 15:45 CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE
[43]  The first picture in the entire Bible is that God offered Himself to man as the tree of life in the form of food, that man may take Him in, eat Him, and have Him as his life.
[44]  Yet the Lord Jesus as the bread of life said, My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink v. 55 . The Lord Jesus as the bread of life indicated that He was a continuation of the tree of life for man s nourishment.
[45]  THE ITEMS OF CHRIST IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
[46]  In Him was life, and this life is the light of men v. 4 . He is the One who is received by His believers and gives them the authority to be the children of God v. 12 . He is the One incarnated as a man, the Word who became flesh who is full of grace and reality v. 14 . He is the One who is declared and testified to us to be the very Lamb of God v. 29 . Ultimately, He is the heavenly ladder who joins the earth to the heaven and who brings heaven to the earth v. 51 .
[47]  Christ is the door, not only for God s elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others, in the Old Testament time before Christ came; but also for God s chosen people, such as Peter, John, James, Paul, and others to come out of the fold of the law after Christ came.
[48]  The Spirit is the transmission of the Triune God, as revealed in 2 Corinthians 13:14 which says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[49]  Such a wonderful Triune God offered Himself to us as our enjoyment in many items.
[50]  Therefore, the unbelievers who are going to receive Christ do not need to go to heaven to bring Christ down v. 6 or go to the abyss to bring Christ up v. 7 . The reason is that Christ, the living Word, is near them, in their mouth and even in their heart v. 8 . If they would exercise their mouth to call, Lord Jesus, Christ as the all-inclusive breath would come into them.
[51]  CHAPTER SIX THE TREE OF LIFE FOR TRANSFORMATION Scripture Reading: Lev 2:7-10; 7:14-15 OUR NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE BIBLE
[52]  WITH DIVINE INSIGHT IN AN INNER AND LIVING WAY
[53]  The entire sixty-six books of the Bible are the Holy Spirit s revelation John 16:13 and are the speaking from God by men borne by the Holy Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 .
[54]  The entire Bible was inspired by the one Spirit and was written with a definite purpose to show us God s heart s desire.
[55]  The Lord told them that they did not know the Scriptures nor the power of God v. 29 and He answered them in this way, But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living vv.
[56]  In Exodus 12, the children of Israel enjoyed the shedding of the blood of the Passover lamb to fulfill the righteous requirement of God.
[57]  The robe is Christ as our righteousness to dress us, to clothe us, according to God s righteous requirements that we may be justified in the eyes of God Jer 23:6; 1 Cor 1:30; Phil 3:9 .
[58]  If we know how to eat Him, how to feast on Him, we will be transformed into precious materials to be built up as the temple 1 Cor 3:12 , as the house of the Lord, and within this house we will enjoy the Lord more and more richly.
[59]  If we enjoy Him by the way of eating, this will turn us from outside the Lord s house to the inside, and this will transform us from pieces of clay into precious stones good for God s building.
[60]  THE TREE OF LIFE IN US Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 15:45; John 14:1-6, 10, 16-20, 23; 20:22
[61]  First Corinthians 15:45 says, So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
[62]  Second, Christ was made not only a Spirit but also a life-giving, life-imparting, Spirit.
[63]  First Corinthians 15:45 does not specifically say that Christ, the Son of God, or that Jesus became a life-giving Spirit.
[64]  In Him was life v. 4 . How could this life which was in Him be ours? In Him was life, but this life was not in us.
[65]  In John 20 after His death and resurrection, this man came back to His disciples in the form of the Spirit and breathed into the disciples, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 . The Holy Spirit is the Spirit that gives life 2 Cor 3:6 . With this Spirit, life comes into us; with this life we have light; and with this light we have all the riches of what this God-man is.
[66]  With this Spirit, there is redemption, the released life, and the overcoming resurrection of Christ.
[67]  Whenever someone opens himself to the Lord Jesus to receive Him as his Savior, this Spirit immediately comes into him with the redeeming power and with the imparting power, redeeming him from all the negative things and imparting into him all the positive things.
[68]  When we believed into Jesus as the Savior, this all-inclusive Spirit came into us, delivering us from all the negative things on the negative side, and grafting us into Christ so that we might become a branch of Christ on the positive side.
[69]  God s desire for the temple, the dwelling place, the universal building for God to rest in, can be realized by our eating of the Lord, by having the Lord mingle Himself with us.
[70]  Finally, in these seven epistles, the Lord Jesus told us that if we have an ear to hear His voice and open the door, He will come in not to teach us but to dine with us, to feast with us, so that we can enjoy Him and He can enjoy us.
[71]  TO THE TREE OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 3:22-24; Heb 4:12, 14-16; 10:19-20 THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD S GLORY,
[72]  Genesis 3:22-24 says, And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever: therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
[73]  God s desire was still that man would enjoy Him as the tree of life, but His glory, His righteousness, and His holiness kept fallen man away from the tree of life.
[74]  When Christ s flesh was crucified, this veil was rent Matt 27:51 , thus opening the way for us who were excluded from God, signified by the tree of life Gen 3:22-24 , to enter into the Holy of Holies to contact Him and take Him as the tree of life for our enjoyment.
[75]  HOW THE GOD-MAN WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO US
[76]  Now we need to see how this God-man could be made available to us.
[77]  OF THE TREE OF LIFE WITHIN US Scripture Reading: Matt 13:3, 8; John 3:5; Luke 17:21; Gal 5:22; Psa 34:8; 1 Pet 2:2-3; 3:7; 2 Pet 1:3-4; Acts 5:20; Rom 5:10, 21 FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD S GLORY,
[78]  God s intention is to work Himself into us as our life in the form of food by our eating of Him.
[79]  If you are going to pass the outer court, you have to fulfill the requirements of God s righteousness; if you are going to get into the Holy Place, you have to fulfill the requirements of God s holiness; and if you are going to get into the Holy of Holies, you need to fulfill the requirements of God s glory.
[80]  With the kingdom of God, the church of Christ, the Christian living, and the Christian ministry, there is a seed.
[81]  In Luke 17 the Lord Jesus told the Pharisees, The kingdom of God is among you v. 21 . The Lord Jesus revealed that the kingdom of God is the Savior Himself, who was among the Pharisees when He was questioned by them.
[82]  Furthermore, the Christian service, the Christian ministry, must be the overflow of the inner life.
[83]  We are not merely working, but our work is the overflow of the divine life from within us.
[84]  Regardless of what gift we have or of what kind of gift we are to the Body, we have to realize that our work, our ministry, must be a work and ministry with Christ as the seed sown into us to grow up within us and to flow out from within us in order to minister Christ into others.
[85]  May the Lord help us to realize what it means to have Christ as the seed in the kingdom, in our church life, in our daily walk, and in our work.
[86]  The grace of life is God as life and life supply to us in His Trinity the Father as the source of life, the Son as the course of life, and the Spirit as the flow of life, flowing within us with the Son and the Father 1 John 5:11-12; John 7:38-39; Rev 22:1 .
[87]  CHAPTER ELEVEN HOW TO FEAST ON THE TREE OF LIFE
[88]  THROUGH THE WORD Scripture Reading: Matt 15:21-28; 22:2; 1 Cor 10:21; 11:24-26; Rev 19:9; Psa 23:5; John 6:63; 2 Cor 3:6; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 3:16; John 1:1; 4:24
[89]  We have pointed out that the tree of life, the matter of life, is the very seed, the very root, of all the things related to God s purpose, especially in four main areas.
[90]  First, the inner life is the seed of the kingdom of God.
[91]  The kingdom of God is something that grows up and grows out of this seed of the inner life.
[92]  The Lord is the living Word, and the Bible is the written Word.
[93]  If we consider the written Word to be something different from the living Word, the written Word will be dead knowledge to us.
[94]  Before we go on to see how to feed on the Lord and how to drink of the Lord by prayer, we need to see some more passages showing us what our concept should be regarding the Word of God.
[95]  Our concept concerning the Word of God is that the Word is merely composed of teachings and instructions, but the divine concept concerning the Word of God is that the word from the Lord is food for us to feed on for our nourishment.
[96]  Verses 18 through 22 say, And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father; being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[97]  PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT WITH THE PRAYER OF CHRIST
[98]  James 5:17 says, Elijah was a man of like feeling with us, and in prayer he prayed that it should not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
[99]  As we pray in this way, we will drink of Him, feed on Him, and breathe Him in to have a deeper mingling with Him, and we will be strengthened, nourished, and refreshed by Him.
[100]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE NEED TO BE POOR IN SPIRIT AND
[101]  We want to see how we have to deal with our heart and our spirit in order to experience the tree of life.
[102]  First Thessalonians 5:23 strongly indicates that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.
[103]  There are many other passages in the Scriptures showing us that man is a tripartite being see The Parts of Man published by Living Stream Ministry .
[104]  The three parts of the soul are the mind, the knowing part Psa 13:2; 139:14 , the emotion, the loving part 1 Sam 18:1; S. S. 1:7 , and the will, the deciding part Job 7:15; 6:7 . The mind is for us to think, to know, and to consider; the emotion is for us to love, to hate, to be happy, or to be sorrowful; and the will is for us to decide or to choose.
[105]  We have seen that the Lord s intention is to sow Himself as the seed of life into us.
[106]  The spirit is enclosed by the heart, so if the Lord is going to come into us, our heart has to be opened.
[107]  After we got saved it may have been that gradually our emotion became closed to Him, our will became closed to Him, our mind became closed to Him, and our conscience became closed to Him.
[108]  FULFILLED IN TRANSFORMATION Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-12; 1 Cor 3:9, 12; John 1:42; Heb 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18; Rev 22:1-2; 21:18-21
[109]  As we have seen, the tree of life is the central subject, the central thought, of the entire Scripture.
[110]  In the beginning God created the universe and He created man as a vessel to contain Him.
[111]  God presented Himself to man as man s enjoyment that man may take Him in. By man s eating of the tree of life, the very Triune God could come into man and mingle Himself with man to make Himself one with man.
[112]  After our birth we continue to enjoy Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as our food, our drink, our air, and even as our abode, our dwelling place, day by day.
[113]  We have to eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him in. This living Christ within us will transform us and sanctify us in our disposition through our enjoyment of Him.
[114]  Feast on Him, drink Him, breathe Him in, abide in Him, praise Him, adore Him, and behold Him.
[115]  God s way is to put Christ into us for us to enjoy Him by eating Him, drinking Him, breathing Him in, abiding in Him, and letting Him be everything to us.
[116]  This city is the counterpart of Christ and the dwelling place of God for God to rest in. As the counterpart of Christ, the holy city satisfies Christ, and as the dwelling place of God, the holy city satisfies God.
[117]  BEHOLDING AND REFLECTING HIS GLORY Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:3, 6, 17-18 GOD S INTENTION TO MINGLE HIMSELF WITH US
[118]  In the Scriptures a wonderful, mysterious, and glorious fact is revealed, that is, God s intention is to mingle Himself with us human beings.
[119]  The first illustration of God s intention in the Scriptures is the tree of life, which is to be taken as food into our being.
[120]  The tree of life typifies the Triune God with the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow that we may partake of Him as our food.
[121]  He is presented to us in the form of food that we may take Him in. Then He will be mingled with us.
[122]  When we eat the Lord as the tree of life, He will be one with us and He will be mingled with us.
[123]  He imparts Himself into us by our drinking Him, eating Him, and breathing Him in. To eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him in is to allow Him to write Himself into us, to inscribe Himself into us, by our beholding Him.
[124]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN GOD S ULTIMATE INTENTION REALIZED Scripture Reading: Rev 21:2-3a, 10-14, 18-23; 22:1-5; 2:7; 7:14-17; 21:6; 22:17
[125]  We have seen that God presented Himself to us as the tree of life for our enjoyment in the form of food that we may eat of Him.
[126]  Throughout the whole Bible God s unique intention is that we would take Him into us and enjoy Him within as our life and everything.
[127]  John 1:1 and 4 say, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[128]  THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE RIVER OF LIFE
[129]  Upon the throne is the Lamb, the Lamb is the lamp, and God is the light within the lamp v. 23 . One throne for both God and the Lamb signifies that God and the Lamb are one.
[130]  All the redeemed ones are the tabernacle to God for God to dwell in, and God Himself is the temple to us for us to dwell in. Eventually, God will dwell in us, and we will dwell in God.
