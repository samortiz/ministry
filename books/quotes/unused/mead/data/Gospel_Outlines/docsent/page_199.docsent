   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject One Hundred Ninety-eight JESUS IS THE PROPITIATION FOR OUR SINS Scripture: 1 John 2:2; 4:10 Sin separates man from God Man s sins violate God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s heart draws Him toward man in love, but God s righteousness has forced Him to forsake man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, His love cannot reach sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus propitiates for us The Lord Jesus bore man s sins according to the requirements of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus propitiated the very matter which formerly prevented God s love from reaching man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God provides in love The Lord Jesus as our propitiation is the provision of God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because God, in His love, wants to be gracious to man while at the same time God s righteousness puts requirements upon man, God provided man with the Lord Jesus as the propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Note: The point is not that God was angry and would not forgive man, and that the Lord came to propitiate God s wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The One who conciliates the situation is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s heart causes Him to deal with man in love, but God s righteousness puts requirements upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore God Himself provided man with the Lord Jesus as the propitiation to propitiate the contradictory situation between God s love and God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How to obtain the propitiation of the Lord Jesus</S>
