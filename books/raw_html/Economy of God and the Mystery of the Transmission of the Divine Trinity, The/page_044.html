<h2 class=head2>Apprehending the Breadth, Length, Height, and Depth of Christ</h2><p>Once the Lord has made His home in our hearts, Paul continued to say, the result is that we are “full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are” (Eph. 3:18). Here the breadth, length, height, and depth refer to the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe. Who can tell how wide is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth of the universe? We all know that many, many solar systems constitute one galaxy, and many, many galaxies constitute the universe. The universe is boundless, and its breadth, length, height, and depth are also limitless. These dimensions are the dimensions of Christ; Christ is such an unlimited One. When Christ makes His home in our hearts for us to experience and enjoy, we find that this Christ, into whom we believe and whom we enjoy, know, and experience, is boundless and unsearchable.<h2 class=head2>Knowing the Knowledge-surpassing Love of Christ in Our Experience</h2><p>Verse 19a says, “And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ.” According to the context, this means that due to the Lord’s making His home in us, we can experience Him as the unsearchable One. Immediately we can also know His love; that is, we know that His love surpasses human knowledge and understanding. It is very strange that on the one hand, Christ’s love surpasses human understanding, but on the other hand, we can know it. Man can neither know nor understand this love, yet we who allow the Lord to make His home in us can know and experience it. According to our intellect, Christ’s love is knowledge-surpassing, and our mind can never understand it; according to our experience in our spirit, however, we can know it.<p>Once we experience Christ’s making His home in us, we can know how great the love of Christ is. That the Triune God would make us His dwelling place and would reside in us to be our life, our nature, and our content reveals the greatness of the love of Christ. What a love this is! How great a love this is! This is not only the love in His dying on the cross for us but also the love in His entering into us. How excellent the heavens are, and how beautiful the earth is! Yet the Lord is not satisfied; rather, He longs to dwell in us, making us His home, that He may be our life and nature and become our content. Can we imagine what kind of great love this is?<p>Throughout the centuries very few Christians have apprehended Christ’s love to such an extent. The majority of Christians know only the Lord’s love in dying on the cross for them; they do not know His love in His making His home in them. He loves us to the extent that He not only died for us but also considers us His dwelling place. Who are we? How uncomely we are! Yet He comes to make His home in us, to be our life, our nature, and our content, and to live and move in us. Hence, it is not until we allow Christ to make His home in us that we will be able to understand the extent of the Lord’s love toward us and to know His knowledge-surpassing love.
