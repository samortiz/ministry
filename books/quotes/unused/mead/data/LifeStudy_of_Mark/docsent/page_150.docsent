   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE THE RESURRECTION AND ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SLAVE-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND HIS UNIVERSAL SPREADING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THROUGH HIS DISCIPLES Scripture Reading: Mark 16:1-20</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapter sixteen of the Gospel of Mark covers three matters: the resurrection of the Slave-Savior vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1-18 , the ascension of the Slave-Savior for His exaltation v. 19 , and the Slave-Savior s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>DISCOVERED BY THREE WOMEN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 16:1-8 the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was discovered by three women Mary the Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome v. 1 . In verse 6 an angel said to them, Do not be amazed; you are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was raised!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is not here!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Behold, the place where they laid Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Slave-Savior s resurrection is proof that God is satisfied with what He accomplished through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is also a confirmation of the effectiveness of His redeeming and life-imparting death Acts 2:24; 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to verse 7, the angel said to the women, But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, even as He told you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the angel s message to the three women who discovered the resurrection of the Slave-Savior, the phrase and Peter is inserted only in Mark s record.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is probably due to Peter s influence on the contents of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In any case, this phrase indicates that Peter s intimate relationship with the Slave-Savior was particular, so that it was emphasized even by the angel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GOING INTO GALILEE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 7 the angel said that the Lord Jesus was going before the disciples into Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Just as the Slave-Savior began His ministry from Galilee of the Gentiles Matt 4:12-17 , not from Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jewish religion, so also after His resurrection He would still go to Galilee, not to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This strongly indicates that the resurrected Slave-Savior abandoned Judaism and was initiating a new era for God s economy of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL TO ALL THE CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 16:9-11 the Lord Jesus appeared to Mary the Magdalene; in verses 12 and 13, to two of His disciples; and in verses 14 through 18, to the eleven disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 15 He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This reveals that the redemption of God accomplished by the Slave-Savior through His death and resurrection is not only for man, the leading one in God s creation, but for all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, all things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to all creation under heaven Col 1:20, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Based upon this, all the creation expects to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God Rom 8:19-22 .</S>
