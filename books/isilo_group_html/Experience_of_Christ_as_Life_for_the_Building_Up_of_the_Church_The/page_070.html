First Corinthians opens in its first chapter by saying that Christ is both theirs and ours (v. 2) and that God has called us into the fellowship of this Christ (v. 9). He is the power of God and the wisdom of God (v. 24). Christ is our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future (v. 30). These points concerning Christ are presented mostly in a doctrinal way. But 2 Corinthians opens in a different way. In its first chapter Paul spoke of how he suffered in tribulation and had been comforted by God (vv. 3-6). This qualified him to comfort others. Because he had experienced the comfort of Christ through much affliction, he had this comfort with which he could comfort others.</P><P>In verses 8 and 9 Paul said, "For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living. Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead." Paul and his co-workers were pressed down beyond their strength. They had the response, the sentence, of death in themselves. To their consideration, they had to die. This led them to put their trust not in themselves but in God who raises the dead. Second Corinthians shows us how the ministry is produced. It is not produced by teaching or education. It is produced through all kinds of suffering.</P><P>In chapter four Paul said that he and his co-workers were troubled in every way (vv. 8-9). They were perplexed and cast down. Paul said that they were always being put to death and that in their body they bore the putting to death of Jesus (vv. 10-11). Through such sufferings the ministry is produced. A gift is produced quickly, but a ministry takes time to be produced. To gain a gift is easy. Balaam's donkey suddenly spoke a human language. That was a real gift obtained easily. But if we are going to have a ministry, it is not so easy. A ministry is produced in a person by his experience of the riches of Christ through sufferings.</P><P>An apple tree does not come into being overnight. The apples produced by the apple tree come from the growth in life, and the growth in life is experienced through sufferings. I would encourage all of us to pray-read Hymns, #635. This hymn tells us how the grapevine produces grapes through sufferings. That producing of the grapevine is its ministry. It is not a gift, but a ministry. A gift is some ability, some talent, you can get overnight, but a ministry is a lifelong matter.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of Christ as Life for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 70</div><br></body></html>
