   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE GOAL OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The goal of consecration is not to become a preacher for God or to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The goal of consecration is to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The result of consecration is service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the original language the word service means "to wait upon."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that a person is prepared to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must remember that the goal of consecration is to wait upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Waiting upon someone may not be strenuous work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To wait upon God means that you stand when He wants you to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He wants to shuffle you aside, you allow Him to shuffle you aside, and if He wants you to run, you run.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what it means to wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God requires that all Christians offer up their bodies to wait on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This does not necessarily mean that He wants you to stand at the pulpit or evangelize some remote land.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It means to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If God sends someone to the pulpit, that person has no choice but to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God sends someone to remote lands, he has no choice but to go.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All our time is for God, but the work that we do is flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone should wait on God, but the specific work that one should engage in is flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must learn to wait on God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The presenting of one's body is for serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as we are Christians, we have to serve God all our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as a person consecrates himself, he must realize that from that point on, the Lord's requirement comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Service to God becomes one's lifelong mission.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May God be gracious to us and show us that our service to Him is our rightful duty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should show every believer that henceforth we are those who serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that as Christians, we can no longer be loose in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not saying that we should not be faithful and committed to our career or that we can be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We still need to be faithful and serious in our vocation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But before God we must see that our entire life is directed towards our service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do everything for the purpose of obeying God's will and pleasing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the reality of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consecration is not how much we can give to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is being accepted by God and being granted the honor of serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Consecration is reserved for Christians alone; it is not for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only the saved ones, those who belong to the Lord, can consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Consecration means that we say, "Lord, You have given me the opportunity and the right to come before You and to serve You."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is saying, "Lord, I am Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>My ears were purchased by the blood; they belong to You.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My hands were purchased by the blood; they belong to You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My feet were purchased by the blood; they belong to You.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From now on I can no longer use them for myself."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We do not beg others to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, we tell them that a way is now available for them to consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is a way to serve our God, the Lord of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must be clear that we are here to serve the Lord of hosts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is grossly wrong to think that consecration is a matter of granting God a favor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The revelation in the Old Testament is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A man can only consecrate himself to God under His approval.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Testament also exhorts us to consecrate ourselves through the compassions of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God loves us so much; therefore, we have to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the most reasonable service.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not a request for favor; this is the most reasonable thing, the most natural thing, to do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Consecration does not depend upon our willingness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is because of God's abounding grace that we can consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must see that having the right to be God's servant is the greatest honor of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is a joyful thing for a man to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is a far more joyful thing for a man to have a part in God's service!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Who do we think our God is?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to see His greatness and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only then will we see the tremendous significance and honor of this service!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What a tremendous thing it is for us to receive His grace and be counted worthy of serving Him!</S>
