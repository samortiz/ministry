<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>HEBREWS—THE SPIRIT OF GRACE</h1><h2 class=head1>THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</h2><p>The Epistle to the Hebrews firstly shows us that the Holy Spirit is the speaking Spirit. Hebrews 3:7-8 says, “Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, ‘Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness.’” The Holy Spirit here is a very emphatic term; according to Greek, it is the Spirit the Holy. Therefore, the word spoken by the Holy Spirit here in Hebrews is different from the word spoken by the Spirit in 1 Timothy 4:1. What the Spirit says there in 1 Timothy 4:1 is not a quotation from the Old Testament but the sensation given to us by the Spirit in our spirit, whereas here in Hebrews the Holy Spirit speaks by quoting the words in the Old Testament.<p>Hebrews 9:8 says, “The Holy Spirit [lit., the Spirit the Holy] thus making this clear, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing.” You see again that the Holy Spirit uses a figure of the Old Testament. Whatever is spoken by “the Spirit the Holy,” whatever is purely the word spoken by God, is a quotation from the Old Testament. Hence, it is the objective Spirit speaking the Old Testament words objectively. However, the word in 1 Timothy 4:1 is a subjective word; it is the feeling given to us from within by the Spirit who is mingled with us as one spirit.<p>Hebrews 10:15-16 says, “And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after having said, ‘This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord.’” Again, this is a quotation from the Old Testament. This is the objective Holy Spirit, not the subjective Spirit, speaking an objective word. Thus, it is again a quotation from the Old Testament. In 1 Timothy 4:1, however, when the subjective Spirit speaks in us a subjective word, He does not quote from the Old Testament. Do you see the difference? Whenever the objective word is spoken, it is “the Spirit the Holy” who speaks to us. Whenever the subjective word is spoken, it is the Holy Spirit mingled with our spirit as one spirit—the subjective spirit—who speaks. That is a feeling that we have from deep within and not a word quoted or a figure taken from the Old Testament.<p>Unlike the other Epistles, the Epistle to the Hebrews does not tell us from the outset who the author is. Rather, it says that God spoke of old through the prophets and speaks now through His Son. Therefore, when it quotes from the Old Testament, it does not do so like the other Epistles by saying that it is a word spoken by Isaiah or by Jeremiah. Rather, it says that it is the Holy Spirit’s speaking. This is an amazing thing. The Epistle to the Hebrews does not indicate plainly the person who speaks but rather tells us that it is God who speaks, or the Holy Spirit who speaks. Thus, the Spirit in Hebrews is the speaking Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT OF GRACE</h2><p>Those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit. (Heb. 6:4)<p>By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace? (10:29)<p>These two verses show us that the Spirit in Hebrews has become the blessing of which we partake. The speaking Spirit has become the Spirit of grace for our enjoyment.
