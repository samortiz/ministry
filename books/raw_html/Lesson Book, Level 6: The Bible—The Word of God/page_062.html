 <h2 class="head2">C. The Result of Rebellion</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Satan Being Judged by God</h2>
<p>[Satan&rsquo;s rebellion brought in God&rsquo;s judgment. God cannot tolerate any rebellion among His creatures. Immediately after Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God declared His judgment on him.] He was cast down to the ground (Ezek. 28:15-18) and he shall be brought down to hell (Isa. 14:15).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Heavens and the Earth Being Judged</h2>
<p>The heavens and the earth are Satan&rsquo;s sanctuary which he has defiled. God rebuked Satan, saying, &ldquo;Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities&rdquo; (Ezek. 28:18). Therefore, the heavens and the earth were also judged by God. Under God&rsquo;s judgment the heavens did not shine and the earth was covered by darkness (Job 9:5-7; Gen. 1:2). This must have happened before Adam was created, because there is no record of such an event in human history; that is, in the six thousand years following the creation of Adam.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Rebellious Angels and the Demons<br />
Being Judged</h2>
<p>When God judged Satan and the universe under him, God also must have judged both the angels who followed him and the living beings on the earth during that age who joined him in his rebellion. After being judged, the rebellious angels became the spiritual forces of evil in the air (Eph. 6:12), and the living beings became the disembodied spirits, the demons, lodging in the water with which they were judged.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Execution of God&rsquo;s Judgment Upon Satan</h2>
<p>[Though Satan, the rebellious angels, and the demons were all judged by God, they are still moving and working today, because the judgment upon them has not yet been executed.</p>
<p>Today, Satan can still go to God to accuse God&rsquo;s people (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Rev. 12:10). He still walks about&quot; on the earth, &ldquo;seeking someone to devour&rdquo; (l Pet. 5:8), still working to blind the thoughts of people (2 Cor. 4:4), to deceive them by transfiguring himself into an angel of light (2 Cor. 11:14). We must not be ignorant of his thoughts (2 Cor. 2:11), neither give place to the Devil (Eph. 4:27). We must withstand him firm in the faith (1 Pet. 5:8-9). We need to put on the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against him (Eph. 6:11-17).</p>
<p>After Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God pronounced His judgment upon him immediately. But it takes a long time to execute God&rsquo;s judgment. The Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh that He might destroy the works of the Devil (l John 3:8). This was the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment. The Lord gave His disciples authority over all the power of the enemy (Luke 10:19). When the disciples cast out demons, Satan fell from heaven (Luke 10:17-20). Through His death on the cross, He destroyed the Devil (Heb. 2:14). He has bruised the head of the old serpent. Now we, as His Body, must continue this execution, to destroy the tail of the serpent. Through the church&rsquo;s executing work, the Devil will be cast to the earth, and his angels will be cast out with him (Rev. 12:9). He will later be bound and cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:2-3). Eventually, he will be &ldquo;cast into the lake of fire&rdquo; (Rev. 20:10). Then, the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan and his followers will be completed.]</p>
<h2 class="head2">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>[Satan was originally the highest of the archangels created by God. He rebelled against God because of pride and became God&rsquo;s adversary, God&rsquo;s enemy. The heavens the earth, and the universe were corrupted because of Satan&rsquo;s rebellion and fell under God&rsquo;s judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan is being carried out gradually until Christ comes again, when he will be bound and cast into the abyss for one thousand years. At the end of the one thousand years, he will be released from the abyss and will rebel for the last time. Immediately after this rebellion, he will be cast into the lake of fire to be punished for eternity. Thus, God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan will be completed.]</p>
