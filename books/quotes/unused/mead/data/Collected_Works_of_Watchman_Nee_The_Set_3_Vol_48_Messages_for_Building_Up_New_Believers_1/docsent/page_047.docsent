   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANNULLING OF CLASS DISTINCTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another intransigent relationship in human society is class distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not experience national distinctions too much unless we meet foreigners.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we come across the problem of class distinctions daily.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostle tells us that there is no class distinction between the free man and the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Christ, there is no free man or slave.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such distinctions no longer exist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our generation has probably never experienced the sharp class separation which exists between the free man and the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, Paul wrote his Epistles during Roman rule when the practice of slavery was at its zenith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time of the Roman Empire, there was a cattle market, a sheep market, and a human market.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This can be compared to the textile exchange, the commodity exchange, the stock exchange, and the gold exchange in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time in Rome, there was a human exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Romans fought many wars and captured many people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They put these captives in the market for sale.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a master felt that the children of a slave were eating too much, he could bring the children to the market and sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a practice was very common in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Human beings were bought and sold like goods.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Profitability was measured by the number of children one produced; those who produced more were sold for a better price.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time there was a great distinction between the free man and the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although the idea of democracy came from Rome, and although civil rights, suffrage, and voting began from Rome, these rights belonged to free men only; the slaves had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one killed a slave, he merely needed to negotiate the monetary worth of the slave with the master and pay accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The slave had no civil rights; he was not considered a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Killing a slave was like killing a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The most one had to do was pay for the cow; there was no need to pay for the life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Children of slaves were slaves automatically, and they belonged to their master.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For their whole life, they had no freedom of their own unless their master chose to release them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they ran away, they would be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This kind of class distinction is many times harsher than that between masters and servants, employers and employees, and bosses and subordinates of today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such distinctions no longer exist anywhere on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But long before the world abolished this practice, God's Word already had abolished such class distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the three Epistles to the Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians, Paul stated that there was no distinction between the free man and the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a distinction is abolished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the New Testament the book of Philemon speaks of a slave of Philemon by the name of Onesimus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Philemon was a co-worker of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Onesimus believed in the Lord, he too became a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When they were at home, Onesimus was the slave and Philemon was the master.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if Philemon brought Onesimus to the meeting of the church, one would call Onesimus Philemon's brother, not his slave.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church, relationships between masters and servants cease.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When they knelt down to pray together, Onesimus was Philemon's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when they rose up to do their work, Onesimus was Philemon's slave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Lord they were one, in the new man they were one, and in the Body they were one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please pay attention to this: In Christ the master-slave relationship does not exist, in the new man this relationship does not exist, and in the church this relationship does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Christ all class distinctions are totally abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no more class consciousness or class struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before God we must see that today we may be a servant, a subordinate, or an employee.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should take our stand in the workplace and learn to submit to our superior or master.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, when we come before God, we should not yield to someone just because he is our master or boss.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In our discussion over spiritual matters, we should not consider our master or our superior to be always right or his reasoning to be always correct.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we kneel down to pray or discuss spiritual matters, our status is changed, and there is no class distinction between us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot introduce any class relationship into the church, because such a relationship does not exist in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This fact is especially important when we come to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Recall how James condemned such a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said when a rich man comes, he is given a better seat, and when a poor man comes, he is told to stand or be seated at the footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>James condemned such an act as a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we come to the meeting to fellowship with God's children, we must be clear that our standing is in Christ, in the new man, and in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our standing is not based on any class distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Only Christians can break down all class distinctions, and only they can do it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only Christians can hold hands together and greet each other as brothers because only they have love.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only Christians those who are in Christ can remove all class distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A young person must realize that as long as he is a believer in Christ, his Christian boss is his brother and his Christian subordinate is also his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His Christian master is his brother, and his Christian slave is also his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The distinction between the free man and the slave is annulled entirely; this distinction no longer exists.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can only fellowship with our brothers and sisters based on the little that the Lord has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are all brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we do this, we will be greatly blessed by the Lord, and the church will be filled with the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Several Christians in Chungking once wanted to build a church for the government officials.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They came and asked me for my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I said, "What name are you going to give to this church?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I think you should name it The Church of the Civil Officers.'"</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If it is a church of officers, surely it is not something in Christ, because there is no such thing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is neither free man nor slave in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If a free man wants to be saved, he has to receive the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a slave wants to be saved, he also must receive the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is no difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We cannot add anything to Christ or subtract anything from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Man cannot build a church for officers, because there is no such thing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everyone has to learn to be a brother or a sister.</S>
