   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE FIVE STEPS TOWARD A NEW RELIGION Scripture Reading: Rev 1:12-18; 2:1-7, 12-21, 24-29; 3:1-6, 14-22; 17:4-5; 18:2, 4; 19:7-8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the Book of Revelation, where we also see many things concerning Christ versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must all realize that the Christ in this book differs distinctly from the Christ in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Gospels we see a Christ who is gentle, tender, and mild; but in the Revelation we see a Christ whom we may describe as fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Gospels, the Apostle could lean upon Christ's breast, but in the Revelation, when John saw Christ, he immediately fell to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Christ we see in Revelation is One whose eyes are as a flame of fire and whose voice is as the sound of many waters.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why is there this difference?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is because, when we come to the Book of Revelation, the age has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the aspect and attitude of Christ have also correspondingly changed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this Book of Revelation we have religion, but this religion differs from the religion in the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In all these books, the religion was the old religion, the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But here in the last book of the New Testament, religion takes on a new garb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is no more the Jewish religion, but the Christian religion, the religion of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, in the Book of Revelation, Christ is different and religion also is different.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the seven epistles of the second and third chapters of this book we get a clear view of the new religion, Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Christian religion has become a real religion, and it has become so by steps.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here in these seven epistles we see five steps toward this new religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only two churches among these seven, Smyrna and Philadelphia, have nothing to do with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the rest have very much to do with it, and with each there is a definite step taken towards its formation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are five churches with five steps which together form the new religion of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>WORK WITHOUT LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first step towards this new religion of Christianity is an abundance of work for Christ without an intimate and personal love to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may never have considered that an abundance of labor for the Lord could be something that would form a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have probably thought that there is nothing wrong with working hard for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is wrong with going to the mission field, teaching the Bible, helping people to know the Lord and be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord recognizes all the work, as He did that of the church in Ephesus, but there is a danger.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may labor diligently and accomplish much for the Lord without an intimate and personal love for the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the recovery of the church life we must all be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must work, we must labor for the Lord, but we must be careful that our work is balanced with intimate and personal love for our dear Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Indeed, we need to love Him more than we work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our love for Him must be more precious, more dear than the work we do for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must not be so concerned for what we accomplish for Christ as much as to what extent we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need an intimate and personal love for the Lord Jesus, and this love must be the first love, the best love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word translated "first" in reference to first love Rev 2:4 is the same as that translated "best" in reference to the best robe Luke 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, first love is best love, and this is the love we must maintain continually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may forget to work for Him, but we must never forget to love Him in the first and best way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is primarily not our Master, but our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must never lose sight of our Lord Jesus as our lovely, precious, and present Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To serve Him is secondary; to love Him is primary.</S>
