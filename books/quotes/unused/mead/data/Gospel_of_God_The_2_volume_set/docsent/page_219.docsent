   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is a big difference between punishment and discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's disciplining of His children is not His punishment upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even when God chastises them, this chastisement is not a punishment, but a discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Discipline is with a definite goal, which is that we may partake of His holiness, that we may not live foolishly day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a Christian believes into the Lord Jesus, although he will never lose his salvation, he may receive severe chastisement from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should never say that a Christian can do whatever he wants after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible clearly tells us that after a Christian is saved, even if he is defeated and fallen, he will not perish eternally and will not lose eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, he will receive God's chastising on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not make the mistake of thinking that because we are eternally saved, we can live loosely on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one can refute the fact that once a person is saved, he is eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a Christian unbridles his lusts, commits sins, falls into defilements, and does not have God's holiness, God will extend His hand and will discipline such a one through his environment, his family, his personal health, and his future plans.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He may encounter difficulties in his family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He may experience much illness and misfortune in his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The purpose of God in allowing these things to fall upon him is not a matter of punishing him; they are not there to give him a hard time, but to make him partake of God's holiness and to become worthy of the grace of His calling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the proper understanding of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One should not say that if a Christian does not do good, God will deny that he is a child of God and kick him out like a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If one would say such a thing, either he is blind to the work of the cross of Christ, or he thinks that the work of Christ is a very light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible shows us that salvation is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, the Bible also shows us that there are quite serious punishments among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we fail, there will be much punishment for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God wants us to partake of His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On this earth He wants us to live like sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He does not want to intimidate us with hell so that we will pursue holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be saved is totally of grace, but God has His way to lead us into His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He causes us to encounter many things in our families, in our bodies, in our career, and in our environment so that we will turn back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the purpose of discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ananias and Sapphira were believers; they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They committed the sin of lying to the Spirit, and they received a very severe discipline Acts 5:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At one time, I thought that perhaps Ananias and Sapphira were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By reading the Bible carefully, one has to acknowledge that they were saved because they were with the disciples at the time of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition, they also made an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They were only after some vain glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their sins were not as severe as one would think.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They did not get drunk or commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fact that they were taken from the world quickly proves that they were believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they were worldly people, they probably would have lived much longer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fact that they were removed quickly from the world proves that they were our brother and sister.</S>
