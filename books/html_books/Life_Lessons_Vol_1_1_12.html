The first two volumes cover different matters between a believer and God which he should know, understand, and practice immediately after his salvation. Then the last two volumes cover the full salvation which God has prepared in Christ for us who have believed into Him, the riches which we have obtained in Christ, the experience which we should have in Christ, the things which we should accomplish in Christ, and the goal which we should attain in Christ.</li><li>It is difficult to avoid certain terms which are relatively deep and hard for new believers to understand. There is no need for added explanation while reading these lessons in the meetings. As lesson after lesson is read, a thorough understanding of the terms will be acquired. Even if there is not such a thorough understanding at the time, this understanding will be gained gradually.</li><li>Knowledge is empty and the letter kills; only Christ is reality and only the Spirit gives life. Thus, there must be prayer, confession of sins, and the abundantly rich filling and saturation with the Spirit of Christ before reading these lessons. In reading, there should be the practice of depending less on the mind and more on the spirit, rejecting the old way of knowledge and emphasizing the new way of life. Sentence after sentence that is being read should be pushed out by the spirit with life that others&#8217; spirits may be touched for them to receive the life supply of the pneumatic Christ.</li><li>The Bible verses in these lessons are quoted in an economical and suitable way. Furthermore, their explanations are both concise and adequate, having no need for further explanation. The only need is to repeat what is read, to emphasize what is read, to read in a living way, and to pray-read. At times, the reading should be supplemented by hymns or testimonies. Never extend the meaning of the text or develop an understanding based on inference.</li><li>The Scriptures quoted in these lessons are from the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the King James Version of the Old Testament.</li><li>For these lessons to be beneficial to the home meetings, there is a great need for much prayer.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SALVATION</h2><p>Salvation refers to a person&#8217;s being saved before God, which includes being forgiven of his sins, being spared from perdition, being regenerated, having the eternal life of God, and becoming a child of God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PROOFS OF SALVATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Outward Proof-The Proof by the Bible Without</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved&#8221;</b> (Mark 16:16). This word was spoken by the Lord Jesus Himself.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&#8221;</b> (Rom. 10:13). This is the sure word of the Apostle Paul.</p><p>The two statements above prove that once a person believes and is baptized, calling upon the name of the Lord, he is immediately saved. This fact should be recognized and acknowledged immediately without dependence on human feelings.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;He who hears My word and believes Him [the heavenly Father] who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life&#8221;</b> (John 5:24). The Lord Jesus said this to us with full assurance.</p><p><b>4) &#8220;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God&#8221;</b> (1 John 5:12-13). This is a word testified by the Apostle John.</p><p>The two portions of Scripture above prove that once a person believes in the heavenly Father and believes into the name of the Son of God (the Lord Jesus Christ), he has eternal life (that is, the life of God). He will not come into judgment and perish, but has passed out of death into life. A person is saved in this way to have the life of God based on what the Bible says and not on his own feelings.</p><p><b>5) &#8220;But as many as received Him [the Lord Jesus Christ], to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born...of God&#8221;</b> (John 1:12-13). This is also a word testified by the Apostle John, indicating that the Lord Jesus gives to those who receive Him by faith, that is, to those who believe into His name, the authority to become children of God. This authority is the life of God, enabling those who believe into the Lord Jesus to be born of God, that is, to be regenerated to become children of God. This is also proven by the words of the Bible and not determined by human feelings.</p><p>The words in the Bible are trustworthy and can never be changed or annulled. Human feelings will fluctuate according to mood and environment and are undependable. Since the Bible clearly states that a person is saved upon believing in the Lord Jesus, this fact is then established regardless of human feeling. We should stand on the trustworthy words of the Bible and disregard our fluctuating feelings, believing strongly and knowing with assurance that we have been saved.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Inward Proof-The Proof by the Holy Spirit in Our Spirit</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The Spirit Himself [the Holy Spirit of God] witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God&#8221;</b> (Rom. 8:16).</p><p>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, receiving Him as our Savior, God gives His Holy Spirit to us, putting the Spirit into our spirit (Ezek. 36:27). This Holy Spirit is in us to be with us eternally (John 14:17). He witnesses in our spirit that we are the children of God, who are born of God. Every one of us who believes in the Lord likes to address God as &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; (Rom. 8:15). It is very natural for us to address God as &#8220;Abba, Father.&#8221; As we address God in this way, we feel sweet and comfortable within. This is because we are children who are born of God, with God&#8217;s life, and the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son has entered into us. This is the inward proof of our salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Proof of Love-The Proof by the Experience of Life</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God, and everyone who loves Him who begets, loves him who has been begotten of Him&#8221;</b> (1 John 5:1).</p><p>Once we believe that Jesus is the Christ, we are born of God. God is love (1 John 4:16), and the life of God is also the life of love. Therefore, everyone who is begotten of God loves God and loves him who has been begotten of God, him who is a brother in the Lord.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers&#8221;</b> (1 John 3:14).</p><p>This word states that, as believers, our love for the brothers in the Lord is a proof that we have God&#8217;s eternal life. Loving the brothers in the Lord is an experience in the eternal life of God after we have believed in the Lord to be saved. There is an inexplainable joy and feeling of dearness when a saved person sees a brother in the Lord. This kind of love toward a brother in the Lord is also a proof for us to know that we have been saved. It can be called the proof of love, the proof of our experience in the life of God.</p><p>Therefore, whether it is by the definite word of the Bible, by the witnessing of the Holy Spirit in our spirit, or by our experience of love in life, we may know assuredly that we are saved. Furthermore, the salvation that we have received is an eternal salvation (Heb. 5:9). Once we have received this salvation, we shall by no means perish forever, and no one can snatch us out of the Lord&#8217;s and the heavenly Father&#8217;s hands (John 10:28-29).</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE JOY OF SALVATION</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The joy of...salvation&#8221; (Psa. 51:12); &#8220;songs of deliverance&#8221;</b> (Psa. 32:7).</p><p>Salvation is a joyful matter, and God&#8217;s salvation brings us joy. Therefore, when we are saved, and especially when we know that we have been saved, joy will flood us and we will overflow with songs of salvation, singing forth the joy of salvation. This kind of joyful singing will spontaneously arouse our gratitude and adoration toward the very God who loves us and the very Lord who saves us.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Behold, God is my salvation...and my song... Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation&#8221;</b> (Isa. 12:2-3).</p><p>When we are saved and have obtained God&#8217;s salvation, we will not only sing for joy, but we will also draw water out of the wells of His salvation, receiving from them a continuous and endless supply. This becomes the very encouragement and strength to us Christians that we may be delivered from sins and lusts and overcome the Devil and the world.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON TWO</h1><h1 class="msg">THE NEED OF YOUR WHOLE FAMILY TO BE SAVED</h1><h2 class="head1">I. THE UNIT OF GOD&#8217;S SALVATION</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house&#8221;</b> (Luke 19:9).</p><p>This word of the Lord Jesus was spoken to a great sinner, Zaccheus the tax collector, confirming that a family is the unit of God&#8217;s salvation brought by the Lord. The Lord did not say that salvation had come to that person that day, but rather that salvation had come to that house. Undoubtedly, the Lord wanted Zaccheus&#8217;s entire household to believe in Him and be saved. The Lord&#8217;s word to Zaccheus was at once a suggestion and a notice to him!</p><p><b>2)&#8220;And leading them [the Apostles Paul and Silas] outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household&#8221;</b> (Acts 16:30-31).</p><p>This is the dialogue between the Philippian jailer and the two apostles. The jailer asked what he himself should do to be saved; however, the apostles answered that not only he himself but also he and his household would be saved. This proves that in the heart of the apostles, sent by the Lord to preach His gospel, the Lord&#8217;s salvation was for the individual, while its unit was the household. Again, the apostles&#8217; word to the jailer is both a suggestion and a notice that he should not only pay attention to his personal salvation, but also to that of his whole family!</p><h2 class="head1">II. CASES OF FAMILY SALVATION</h2><h2 class="head2">A. In the Old Testament</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The Whole House of Noah</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark&#8221;</b> (Gen. 7:1); <b>&#8220;In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah&#8217;s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark&#8221;</b> (Gen. 7:13).</p><p>Here the Lord God charged Noah to enter into the ark with his entire house to escape destruction by the flood. This proves that God&#8217;s desire is to take the family as the unit to which He applies salvation. We are also told that Noah brought his whole house, his wife, his sons, and his daughters-in-law, into the ark according to God&#8217;s desire and that, as a result, he and his entire family were delivered by God. Such is the pattern we should all follow today.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Houses of Israel</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house: and if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbor [also an entire family] next unto his house take it&#8221;</b> (Exo. 12:3-4).</p><p>When God was about to strike the firstborn of the Egyptians, He instituted the Passover for the Israelites to save them from the judgment of the destruction of the firstborn. What God instructed them to take was not a lamb for each person but a lamb for a house. This also strongly proves that the unit of God&#8217;s salvation is the family. Moreover, God charged that if a certain family was too small to eat a whole lamb, they should share one with their neighbor next door. Obviously, the neighbor was also counted as a family and not as an individual. This further proves that we should not only bring our own families to receive God&#8217;s salvation, but we should also lead our neighboring families to share in God&#8217;s rich and boundless salvation, which our family cannot exhaust.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Whole House of Rahab the Harlot</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness unto my father&#8217;s house, and give me a true token: and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death&#8221;</b> (Josh. 2:12-13). <b>&#8220;And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein...And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father&#8217;s household, and all that she had&#8221;</b> (Josh. 6:24-25).</p><p>This is the story of how Rahab the harlot and her household were saved when Joshua led the Israelites to destroy Jericho. She was willing to receive the Israelite spies and begged them to save her and her entire house from destruction. Joshua then fulfilled her wish. This also confirms that the family is the unit of God&#8217;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. In the New Testament</h2><h2 class="head3">1. The House of Zaccheus the Tax Collector</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And as He came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down; for today I must stay in your house. And he hurried and came down, and welcomed Him, rejoicing...And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house&#8221;</b> (Luke 19:5-6, 9).</p><p>This is the story of the salvation of Zaccheus the tax collector. In this story, what the Lord did was to stay in Zaccheus&#8217;s house, and what He said was that today salvation had come to this house. This is evidence that the family is the unit of the salvation brought in by the Lord.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The House of Cornelius</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Send to Joppa and send for Simon who is surnamed Peter, who will speak words to you by which you shall be saved, you and all your household&#8221;</b> (Acts 11:13-14). <b>&#8220;And Cornelius was awaiting them, having called together his relatives and intimate friends&#8221;</b> (Acts 10:24). <b>&#8220;While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word&#8221;</b> (Acts 10:44). <b>&#8220;And he charged them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ&#8221;</b> (Acts 10:48).</p><p>This is the story of the salvation of the household of Cornelius, who was a centurion in the Roman military, and of his intimate friends. This story also proves that a person&#8217;s entire family is the unit of the salvation applied by the Spirit upon men. Cornelius led not only his whole family but also his intimate friends to receive the Lord. This coincides with what was mentioned before, that is, that an entire Israelite household should share the Passover lamb with their neighbor.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The House of Lydia</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Lydia...who worshipped God, was listening, whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things spoken by Paul. And when she was baptized and her household...&#8221;</b> (Acts 16:14-15).</p><p>The story of this female believer and her house believing in the Lord and being baptized is also an example of the family as the unit of the Lord&#8217;s salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The House of the Philippian Jailer</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And they spoke the word of God to him together with all those in his house. And taking them with him in that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes; and he was baptized immediately, he and all his household&#8221;</b> (Acts 16:32-33).</p><p>The case of this jailer&#8217;s salvation bears an especially strong proof that the family is the unit of the Lord&#8217;s salvation.</p><p>Besides these cases, there is the house of the royal official in Cana (John 4:46, 53), the household of Crispus, the ruler of a synagogue in Corinth (Acts 18:8), and the household of Stephanas, another Corinthian believer (1 Cor. 1:16). The story of their salvation and of their entire households&#8217; salvation proves that the family is the unit of the Lord&#8217;s salvation. This is a delightful matter in the heart of the sinner-loving God and is the Lord&#8217;s goal in accomplishing redemption. We must imitate the ancient saints in taking care of God&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire to lead our whole family to salvation that the goal of the Lord&#8217;s redemption may be achieved.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE ISSUE OF SALVATION</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah&#8221;</b> (Josh. 24:15).</p><p>This is Joshua&#8217;s last declaration to the children of Israel before his death, which not only indicates that he and his entire house are the object of God&#8217;s salvation but also reveals the result of God&#8217;s salvation with the family as a unit, that is, that he and his house will serve Jehovah. May this also become the desire of each one of us before God and our declaration to the whole universe.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON THREE</h1><h1 class="msg">CLEARANCE OF THE OLD LIVING</h1><p>Since we had a change in our being and became a new man once we were saved, we ought to have a new start, a new beginning, to live a new life. Consequently, there must be a clearance of our old living.</p><h2 class="head1">I. FORSAKING THE IDOLS</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;You turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God&#8221;</b> (1 Thes. 1:9).</p><p>This verse refers to the believers in Thessalonica. Once they believed in the Lord, they turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God. God is a jealous God; He will not tolerate one who serves Him to bow down and worship before any idol (Exo. 20:5). This is because there are demons hidden behind the idols. Therefore, after we believe in the Lord and turn to God, we must leave and forsake idols in every size and shape, whether they are carved or fashioned out of gold, silver, brass, iron, wood, or stone. In the Old Testament, God demanded that His people smash and burn all idols (Deut. 7:5). We who belong to God should do the same, never preserving any idols in order to give them to others. This offends God and corrupts others. According to what is said in Deuteronomy 7:5, not only the idols themselves, but also all objects related to the idols must be smashed and burned.</p><h2 class="head1">II. DISCARDING THE EVIL AND UNCLEAN THINGS</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. So the word of the Lord grew mightily and was strong&#8221;</b> (Acts 19:19-20).</p><p>These verses describe the new Ephesian believers, who originally were worshippers of a great goddess in Ephesus (Acts 19:27). After they believed and turned to God, they brought the evil books in their possession and burned them before all. This case makes clear that after we have believed in the Lord, we should discard all evil and unclean things which have to do with idolatry and wicked works, such as books on fortune-telling and the horoscope, objects with the images or seals of a dragon, and all types of gambling paraphernalia. Things with dragon images and seals ought to be discarded because the dragon is a symbol of the Devil, Satan (Rev. 12:9). Since we are people who belong to God, who worship and serve God, what we wear and what we display and store in our homes must not show any traces of these evil and unclean things. On the contrary, our wardrobe, our ornaments, and our home furnishings and decorations should show people that we believe in the Lord and love God.</p><h2 class="head1">III. MAKING RESTITUTION</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much&#8221;</b> (Luke 19:8).</p><p>These are the words of Zaccheus the tax collector to the Lord when he received Him, which demonstrate the overabounding power of the Lord&#8217;s salvation. He was a tax collector who extorted from others and a money-lover. A great change occurred in him when he received the Lord; he volunteered to give half of his possessions to the poor and to restore four times the unrighteous money he had extorted from others. These actions were not conditions for salvation nor were they the instant requirement and commandment of the Lord, but they were the extraordinary issue of the Lord&#8217;s dynamic salvation which came to Zaccheus. Based on this case of salvation, as soon as possible after we have believed in the Lord, we also ought to return any unrighteous gain to those whom we have wronged. Only then will we have a testimony before men and peace in our conscience. If we obtained the unrighteous gain in secret without others&#8217; knowledge, including those whom we have defrauded, then we should exercise wisdom to make restitution and to return what we owe in secret to avoid causing problems and implicating others. We should only make our restitution known to those who have knowledge of our dark deeds.</p><p>According to the principle of making restitution, after we are saved, we should likewise exercise wisdom to deal with any immoral relationships with others. Only then are we worthy of being acknowledged as a sincere Christian.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FOUR</h1><h1 class="msg">PRAYER</h1><p>The most important thing for a baby at birth is breathing. In our spiritual life, prayer is breathing and is as crucial to a new believer as breathing is to a newborn babe. Hence, after we believe in the Lord and call upon His name to be saved, we must continue to pray and call on the Lord. Then we can receive the spiritual air, which is the Lord&#8217;s Spirit of life, that we may grow and be strong in the spiritual life.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PRAYER</h2><p>The real significance of prayer is to contact God in our spirit and to absorb God Himself. Prayer is the contact of the human spirit with the Spirit of God, during which man inhales God into himself. Therefore, the emphasis of prayer lies not in asking God for things but in contacting and absorbing God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE FACULTY OF PRAYER</h2><p>A person needs the proper faculty in whatever he does. We need our eyes in order to see, our ears in order to hear, and our spirit in order to pray.</p><p><b>1) &#8220;God is Spirit; and those who worship [including praying to] Him must worship in spirit and reality&#8221;</b> (John 4:24).</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Praying at every time in spirit&#8221; [that is, praying with the spirit]</b> (Eph. 6:18).</p><p>The above two verses tell us that God is Spirit, and to worship and pray to Him, we must be in our spirit, that is, we must use our spirit. Our spirit is the deepest part of our being. To pray in the spirit, or to pray with our spirit, is to use our innermost part to contact God. Therefore, we must pray not merely according to the thoughts in our mind, but according to the sense deep within our spirit. The faculty of prayer is not the mind but the spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE MEANS OF PRAYER</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus&#8221;</b> (Heb. 10:19).</p><p>To enter the Holy of Holies is to come before God in order to contact God and pray to God. This is by means of the redeeming blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross, which washes away all the sins that hinder our fellowship with God.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;That whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you&#8221;</b> (John 15:16).</p><p>Here we are told that we should pray to the Father in the name of the Lord Jesus. To be in the name of the Lord Jesus is to be in the Lord Himself. When we pray, we need to pray not only by means of the Lord&#8217;s blood but also by means of the Lord&#8217;s name, that is, by means of the Lord Himself. We cannot come before God to pray by depending on our behavior. Even if our behavior is good, it is like filthy rags in God&#8217;s eyes (Isa. 64:6). Neither can we depend on ourselves, because we also are filthy and unacceptable to God. Thus, when we come before God to pray to Him, we must rely on the Lord&#8217;s blood to wash away the filth in our behavior, and must depend on the Lord Himself to replace our filthy being, so that it is as if the Lord Himself is coming to pray before God. Only such prayers are acceptable to God.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. WHAT TO PRAY ACCORDING TO</h2><p>Prayer is not according to what your mind thinks, but according to what you sense in your spirit. You pray with your mouth whatever you sense in the spirit. When you come before God to pray, do not speak anything to God according to what you have decided on beforehand, but rather utter to God what you sense in your spirit at the time. Confess your sins if you feel in your spirit to confess, and praise the Lord if you feel in your spirit to praise. Do whatever the feeling in your spirit leads you to do.</p><h2 class="head1">V. PRAYING WITHOUT HINDRANCE</h2><p>Praying without hindrance requires a good conscience, that is, a conscience which does not condemn. Once there is offense or condemnation in your conscience, your prayers will be immediately hindered and even stopped.</p><p><b>1) &#8220;Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies... having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience...&#8221;</b> (Heb. 10:22).</p><p>Since we are sinful, we need to be sprinkled by the blood of the Lord Jesus from an evil conscience that we may come forward to the Holy of Holies to draw near to God and to pray to Him. Thus, whenever we pray, we must ask the Lord to sprinkle and cleanse us with His blood so that our conscience may be void of offense. We can then come to God boldly to pray from our spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. THE DEALING IN PRAYER</h2><p>The dealing in prayer is the confession of sins. When you come before God to pray, drawing near with a sincere heart and an open spirit, God, who is light, will shine in you to expose your real self and true condition. At this time, you must confess your sins. After you confess the first sin, you may sense another, and after you confess that, you may sense still another. You must thoroughly confess all your sins according to such feelings in your spirit. If you disregard the sense of condemnation within, surely your prayer will not touch God. It will be hard for you to pray because there is still the barrier of sin between you and God. Therefore, you must confess and deal with every sin. After you have dealt with all of your sins one by one, you should pray according to the sense in your spirit. Then you will surely touch God and absorb Him.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE BENEFITS OF PRAYER</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation&#8221;</b> (Matt. 26:41).</p><p>Prayer enables us to absorb God. Besides this, the main benefit of watchful prayer is that it keeps us from entering into temptation that we may not be tempted and seduced by the Devil to stray from the Lord.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Let us therefore come forward...to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help&#8221;</b> (Heb. 4:16).</p><p>The greatest benefit in praying before God and contacting God is that we receive mercy and find grace for timely help to meet our every need.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus&#8221;</b> (Phil. 4:6-7).</p><p>Another intimate benefit which we receive in coming before God to pray and make petition is that we will have the peace of God, which passes all understanding, guarding our hearts and thoughts from all anxieties. What an intimate blessing it is in the human life to be free from anxieties.</p><p>Besides this, according to the Bible, the benefits we gain from prayer cannot be fully told. May we who belong to the Lord never neglect prayer, but pray at every time (Luke 21:36), even unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). Then we shall surely enjoy God Himself and all His riches, and will be abundantly blessed by Him. He &#8220;is rich to all who call upon Him&#8221; (Rom. 10:12)!</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON FIVE</h1><h1 class="msg">READING THE BIBLE</h1><h1 class="msg">(1)</h1><p>A believer needs to pray; he also needs to read the Bible. Prayer is likened to breathing, and Bible reading, to eating. Both ought to be practiced daily by every believer.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221;</b> (2 Tim. 3:16). The origin of the Bible is God; it was God who breathed His words of revelation through His Spirit into and out of the writers of the Scriptures. What was breathed out was not only words but also spirit.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;But men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit&#8221;</b> (2 Pet. 1:21).</p><p>Since the Bible is God&#8217;s breathing of His words out of men through His Spirit, it is men&#8217;s speaking of the word of God from God as they were borne by the Holy Spirit. Hence, the Bible is out from God, written by certain Old Testament saints such as the prophets, leaders, and kings among the Israelites, as well as by various New Testament saints, such as the apostles, Mark, and Luke.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CONTENT OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>The content of the Bible is both extensive and inclusive; the two main aspects of this content are truth and life. Truth brings us revelation and knowledge of all the realities in the universe, such as the reality of God, the reality of man, the reality of the universe, the reality of the things of the present age, the coming age, and the eternal age, and in particular, the reality of the Christ appointed by God and the church chosen by Him. Life is God coming to be our life that we may be regenerated, grow, be transformed, and be conformed into the image of Christ, who expresses God, that we may become the expression of God.</p><p><b>1) &#8220;Your [the Father God&#8217;s] word is truth [reality]&#8221;</b> (John 17:17).</p><p>This word of the Lord Jesus indicates that God&#8217;s word in the Bible is truth; it reveals the reality of God Himself and of His economy for us to obtain.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Speak to the people all the words of this life&#8221;</b> (Acts 5:20).</p><p>This is what the angel spoke to Peter, charging him to preach God&#8217;s words of life. The words of life are the words of the Bible which the apostles preached. Since the words contain life, they are able to supply life, and this life is God Himself. This proves that the main content of the Bible is not only truth but also life.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE FUNCTION OF THE BIBLE</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;It is these [the Scriptures] that testify concerning Me [Christ]&#8221;</b> (John 5:39).</p><p>The first function of the Bible is to testify concerning Christ. Christ is the subject and content of the Bible, and the Bible is the explanation and expression of Christ. Christ is the living Word of God, and the Bible is His written word. Without Christ, the living Word, as reality, the written words of the Bible are but empty doctrines and vain letters. Yet without the written word of the Bible as His expression, Christ, the living Word, would be abstract and intangible. Therefore, we must read the Bible if we desire to know Christ.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;The sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus&#8221;</b> (2 Tim. 3:15).</p><p>On the one hand, the Bible testifies concerning Christ; on the other hand, it makes us wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus, revealing to us the method of God&#8217;s salvation in Christ and the way of man&#8217;s salvation through faith, that we may know how to be saved.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God&#8221;</b> (1 Pet. 1:23).</p><p>The living word of God in the Bible is the seed of life which enables us to have God&#8217;s life and to be regenerated.</p><p><b>4) &#8220;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation&#8221;</b> (1 Pet. 2:2).</p><p>The milk of the word here refers to God&#8217;s word becoming the nourishing milk. To the newly regenerated spiritual babes, God&#8217;s word in the Bible is the nourishing milk which causes them to grow.</p><p><b>5) &#8220;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God&#8221;</b> (Matt. 4:4).</p><p>According to its context, the words that proceed out through the mouth of God in this verse refer to the words of God in the Bible. The words of God in the Bible are not only our spiritual milk but also our spiritual food which nourishes us that we may grow and become mature.</p><p><b>6) &#8220;The entrance of thy [God&#8217;s] words giveth light&#8221;</b> (Psa. 119:130).</p><p>Once we enter into God&#8217;s word, it becomes opened (unfolded) to us, and it gives us light, shining upon us and giving us wisdom and revelation.</p><p><b>7) &#8220;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path&#8221;</b> (Psa. 119:105).</p><p>The word of God in the Bible not only shines inwardly over our hearts and spirits to give us wisdom and revelation, but it also gives light outwardly to our steps and pathways so that we would not be lost.</p><p><b>8) &#8220;All Scripture is...profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work&#8221;</b> (2 Tim. 3:16-17).</p><p>The words of the Bible have the diverse functions of teaching, reproving, correcting, and instructing people in righteousness that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.</p><p>Besides the various functions mentioned above, there are many other functions of the Bible which are not enumerated here.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE PRECIOUSNESS AND SWEETNESS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver&#8221;</b> (Psa. 119:72). <b>&#8220;More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold&#8221;</b> (Psa. 19:10).</p><p>These verses reveal the preciousness of God&#8217;s word in the Bible for which our desire is continually stirred up.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;How sweet are thy words unto my taste! Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth&#8221;</b> (Psa. 119:103). This shows the sweetness and loveliness of God&#8217;s word.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON SIX</h1><h1 class="msg">READING THE BIBLE</h1><h1 class="msg">(2)</h1><h2 class="head1">V. THE SECTIONS OF THE BIBLE</h2><p>The entire Bible is divided into two parts. The first part is called the Old Testament and the second part is called the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament</h2><p>This refers to the first part of the Bible, which is composed of thirty-nine books that are divided into:</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Books of Law</h2><p>These include a total of five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy and are called the books of law because in them are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which form the Law.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Books of History</h2><p>These include a total of twelve books from Joshua to Esther and record the history of the Israelites from their entrance into Canaan to their return from captivity. Hence, they are called the books of history.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Books of Poetry</h2><p>These include a total of five books from Job to the Song of Songs, pouring out the different spiritual experiences of the people of God through poetry.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Books of the Prophets</h2><p>These include a total of seventeen books from Isaiah through Malachi written by the prophets, the contents of which are mainly prophecies concerning the Israelites, the Gentiles, and Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The New Testament</h2><p>This refers to the second part of the Bible which is composed of twenty-seven books that are divided into:</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Books of History</h2><p>These include a total of five books from the Gospel of Matthew to the Acts of the Apostles, the first four being a history of the Lord Jesus and the last being the account of the move of the disciples on the earth after the Lord ascended into the heavens.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Epistles</h2><p>These include a total of twenty-one books from the book of Romans to the book of Jude, which are letters written by the apostles to either the churches or individual saints, especially speaking about the church and the proper condition in the spiritual life and living of the church and the saints.</p><h2 class="head3">3. The Book of Prophecy</h2><p>The only book of prophecy in the New Testament is the book of Revelation, the concluding book of the New Testament and the last book of the entire Bible. It contains prophecies related to the church, Israel, the world, Christ&#8217;s second coming, the destiny of Satan, the ultimate judgment, and the coming age and eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">VI. HOW TO READ THE BIBLE</h2><p>Since the Bible is the word of God, its nature is divine and spiritual. We must read it with every part of our being.</p><h2 class="head2">A. First, Reading It with Understanding</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Then He opened their mind [to which understanding belongs] to understand the Scriptures&#8221;</b> (Luke 24:45).</p><p>In reading the Bible, we must first use the understanding of our mind to comprehend its text, which was written in human language, and to know its meaning.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Then Reading It with Wisdom</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom...&#8221;</b> (Col. 3:16).</p><p><b>2) &#8220;God...the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him&#8221;</b> (Eph. 1:17).</p><p>These two verses mean that we need to understand with wisdom the word regarding the divine things revealed by God in the Bible. Ephesians 1:17 also shows us that wisdom is joined to our spirit. This wisdom is not what we have naturally but what we obtain through prayer. Such wisdom in our spirit is deeper and higher than the understanding in our mind. We understand the letter of the Bible with the understanding in our mind, and we apprehend the truth in the Bible by the wisdom in our spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Finally, Receiving It with the Spirit</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And receive...the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit&#8221;</b> (Eph. 6:17-18).</p><p>Here we are told to receive the word of God by praying in the spirit. This reveals to us that we also need to exercise our spirit when we read and receive the word of God. This is done, undoubtedly, through prayer. Therefore, in reading the Bible, after we have understood the meaning of the text by our understanding and have apprehended the truth of the text with our wisdom, we should use our spirit by prayer to receive the truths in the Scripture into the deepest part of our being, that is, our spirit. In other words, after we understand the text and receive the truth therein, we still must exercise our spirit to turn what we have understood and realized into prayer that it may be assimilated in our spirit, becoming our life supply and the basis of our spiritual experience.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Pray-reading</h2><p>Another simple, spiritual, and most beneficial way to read the Bible is pray-reading. We take the Bible text as prayer and pray-read with it. Not only do we read and pray simultaneously, or pray and read, read and pray; but also we directly turn the text we are reading into the very words of prayer to pray with. At times we may apply the text to ourselves through prayer. The more we repeat this kind of pray-reading, the more uplifted and released our spirit becomes and the greater, deeper, and richer the benefit is which we receive.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE TIME TO READ THE BIBLE</h2><p>We may read the Bible at any time and should do it whenever necessary. However, generally speaking, it is best to read in the morning before we contact any persons or things, and it is especially good to match reading with prayer. Such times should not be too long. The most suitable way is to pray for ten minutes and read for ten minutes. Sometimes reading and prayer can be mingled together.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON SEVEN</h1><h1 class="msg">KNOWING THE TRUE GOD</h1><p>God is the foremost item revealed in the Bible because He is the beginning of all things. Everything in the universe originated from Him and began with Him. God is also the main content of the Bible from its first book to the last. He created us and regenerated us and has everything to do with our life and our being. Thus, we should know Him first.</p><h2 class="head1">I. ALL IDOLS BEING FALSE GODS</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men&#8217;s hands. They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: they have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: they have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat...neither is there any breath in their mouths&#8221;</b> (Psa. 115:4-7; 135:15-17).</p><p>According to these verses, all idols are false and are not the true God.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. For if even there are so-called gods...even as there are many gods and many lords, yet to us there is one God&#8221;</b> (1 Cor. 8:4-6).</p><p>These verses clearly state that since God is the true God, the one unique God, all the idols are nothing and the so-called gods are not God.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity...of them that hate me&#8221;</b> (Exo. 20:5).</p><p>This verse also tells us that the one and only true God is a jealous God who hates all the idols and will punish the sin of idol worship.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE UNIQUE TRUE GOD</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;I am Jehovah, and there is none else, there is no God beside me&#8221;</b> (Isa. 45:5).</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Now to the King of the ages, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages&#8221;</b> (1 Tim. 1:17).</p><p><b>3) &#8220;How you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God&#8221;</b> (1 Thes. 1:9).</p><p>These three verses clearly and emphatically reveal to us how God is the unique Jehovah, incorruptible, invisible, and existing unto eternity. Besides Him, there is not another true God.</p><h2 class="head1">III. ELOHIM-THE FAITHFUL MIGHTY ONE</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&#8221;</b> (Gen. 1:1).</p><p>Here in Hebrew, the word for God is Elohim. This is the first divine title used in the Bible to reveal God, and it means the faithful mighty One. It shows that the true God, whom we worship according to the Bible, is not only mighty but also faithful. He is the mighty One; so He could create the heavens, the earth, all things, and mankind, calling what is not being as being. He is faithful; therefore, He is dependable, ever unchanging, and immovable. His works according to His faithfulness are as enduring as the sun and as established as the moon (Psa. 89:33-37).</p><h2 class="head1">IV. JEHOVAH-THE SELF-EXISTING AND EVER-EXISTING I AM</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM [THE SELF-EXISTING AND EVER-EXISTING ONE]...Jehovah God...this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations&#8221;</b> (Exo. 3:14-15).</p><p>Here God told Moses in plain words that His name is Jehovah. The name Jehovah is the second main divine title used by the Bible in revealing God. It means the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, the I Am who was, who is, and who is to come. It indicates that He is the I Am, and besides Him nothing is. Only He is, and He is the self-existing and ever-existing I Am, who was, who is, and who is coming. Thus, everything in the entire universe is vain and is not; only He is, only He exists forever, and only He is reality. He is everything to the people whom He created and who belong to Him. Whatever they need, He is.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness&#8221;</b> (Gen. 1:26).</p><p>The word God here is still Elohim. It is in the plural, denoting that this God, Elohim, is the very Triune God to be revealed later in the Bible. Hence, in this verse in Genesis 1, God called Himself &#8220;Us.&#8221; Several times later in the Bible God also called Himself &#8220;Us&#8221; (Gen. 3:22; 11:7; Isa. 6:8; John 17:21-22). These verses indicate that though God is uniquely one, He also has the aspect of three. He is the Triune God.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&#8221;</b> (Matt. 28:19).</p><p>After Christ resurrected and passed through all the necessary processes, it is shown here in plain words in this verse of the Bible that the unique true God is triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three and are distinct, they are one unique God. Although the name in this verse is of the Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, it is singular, indicating that the Three are still the one unique God despite the distinction between them.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;Except Him [the Son] who is from God, He has seen the Father&#8221;</b> (John 6:46). <b>&#8220;I [the Son] am from Him [the Father]&#8221;</b> (John 7:29).</p><p>In these two verses, Christ the Son of God says that He is from the Father. This proves that the Father is the source.</p><p><b>4) &#8220;I [the Son] am from Him [the Father]&#8221;</b> (John 7:29).</p><p>In the Greek text, the word &#8220;from&#8221; has the meaning of &#8220;from with.&#8221; This reveals to us that the Son is not only from the Father, but from with the Father. When He came to earth, He brought the Father and the Father came with Him.</p><p><b>5) &#8220;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#8221;</b> (John 1:18).</p><p>This verse clearly states that the Son who brought the Father is the manifestation of the Father. The Father is the source, and the Son is the manifestation. Therefore, &#8220;I [the Son] and the Father are one&#8221; (John 10:30).</p><p><b>6) &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you...and I in you&#8221;</b> (John 14:16-20).</p><p>This section shows us that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son to be the reality of the Son, coming to abide with the disciples and to be in them. His being in the disciples is the Son in them. Therefore, the Spirit is the reaching and entering in of the Son. This indicates that the Son and the Spirit are also one. The Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation of the Father, and the Spirit is the reaching and entering in of the Son with the Father. The Three are just one God, who was manifested from the source to come among men and who reached the disciples to enter into them. This signifies that God is triune for the purpose of working Himself into those who believe into the Son to be their life and everything and to become their divine enjoyment.</p><p><b>7) &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&#8221;</b> (2 Cor. 13:14).</p><p>This is the blessing of the Apostle Paul to the believers that they may enjoy the triune care of the Triune God in love, grace, and fellowship. The love of God the Father became the grace of Christ, God the Son, in the fellowship of God the Spirit, to be the daily blessing and enjoyment of the believers.</p><p><b>8) &#8220;But when the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father&#8221;</b> (John 15:26).</p><p>The word &#8220;from,&#8221; as we have mentioned before, means &#8220;from with.&#8221; The Spirit of reality sent by the Son from the Father is actually from with the Father. This proves that the Spirit is not only one with the Father but also one with the Son, who is one with the Father. This verse also demonstrates that all Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, coexist from eternity to eternity without succession.</p><p><b>9) &#8220;I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me&#8221;</b> (John 14:10).</p><p>This word shows us how the Father, the Son, and the Spirit not only coexist but also coinhere. Coexistence indicates distinction whereas coinherence signifies mingling as one. This confirms that despite a distinction among the Three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, They are still one God; They are Three yet one, and all three are one. This is strongly proven by the following verses:</p><p><b>1. &#8220;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The Father of eternity&#8221;</b> (Isa. 9:6).</p><p>This word clearly says that the Son is called the Father, proving that the Son and the Father are one.<p><b>2. &#8220;And the Lord [Jesus Christ] is the Spirit&#8221;</b> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p><p>This word also plainly shows that Christ the Son is the Spirit, proving that the Son and the Spirit are one.</p><p>Therefore, the Bible reveals that although the true God is uniquely one, He is three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit; and while the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, They are still the one unique God.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON EIGHT</h1><h1 class="msg">KNOWING CHRIST</h1><h1 class="msg">(1)</h1><p>Christ is the subject and center of the Bible and is the main content of the Bible from beginning to end. Even more He is the reality of our faith. We who have believed into Him and received grace must know Him in a thorough way.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE SACRED TITLES OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Jesus</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins&#8221;</b> (Matt. 1:21).</p><p>When Christ was incarnated to be a man, He was given the name Jesus by an angel. Jesus is equivalent to Joshua in Hebrew (Num. 13:16), which means the salvation of Jehovah, or Jehovah the Savior. Thus, He is the Savior, who will save His people from their sins.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Christ</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Mary, of whom was born Jesus, Who is called Christ&#8221;</b> (Matt. 1:16).</p><p>The second name of Christ is Christ, the equivalent of Messiah in Hebrew (John 1:41), which means the anointed One. This name reveals that He is God&#8217;s anointed One, being anointed by God with His Spirit to create and to redeem in order to fulfill God&#8217;s eternal purpose.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Emmanuel</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us&#8221;</b> (Matt. 1:23).</p><p>Jesus and Christ were names given by God. When men discovered that He was God, they called Him Emmanuel, which means God with us. This name reveals that Jesus, who is our Savior, and Christ, who is God&#8217;s Anointed, are actually God Himself coming to be with us.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class="head2">A. God</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever&#8221;</b> (Rom. 9:5).</p><p>This word simply and strongly declares that Christ is God, who is over all, the complete God blessed forever.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Son of God</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God&#8221;</b> (John 20:31).</p><p>We have already seen how God has the aspects of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. All Three-God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit-are God, even the one unique God. Since Christ is God, He is not only God the Father, but also God the Son, that is, the Son of God.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Man</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God...And the Word became flesh&#8221;</b> (John 1:1, 14).</p><p><b>2) &#8220;The Man, Christ Jesus&#8221;</b> (1 Tim. 2:5).</p><p><b>3) &#8220;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, who was manifested in the flesh&#8221;</b> (1 Tim. 3:16).</p><p>The three portions of the Word above clearly tell us that Jesus Christ, who is God, became flesh to be a perfect man with a human body and human nature. Therefore, He is God manifested in the flesh. He is God and He is man, a God-man, possessing both the divine and the human natures. As to His divine nature, He is completely God; as to His human nature, He is perfectly man. This is a great mystery.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Creator</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands&#8221;</b> (Heb. 1:10).</p><p>This tells us that Christ is also the Creator.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Firstborn of All Creation</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The Son of His love...Firstborn of all creation&#8221;</b> (Col. 1:13, 15).</p><p>This makes known to us that Christ is also a creature; He is the Firstborn, the first item, of all creation. As God, He is the Creator of heaven and earth; as a man, He is the first One of all creation.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE WORK OF CHRIST</h2><p>In being anointed by God to be God&#8217;s anointed One to fulfill His eternal plan, Christ accomplished and will accomplish the following great things:</p><h2 class="head2">A. Creating</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands&#8221;</b> (Heb. 1:10).</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Because in Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him&#8221;</b> (Col. 1:16).</p><p>These two verses tell us that the first great thing Christ did was to create the heavens and the earth, all things, and man. Hence, He is the Creator of all things.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Becoming Flesh</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality&#8221;</b> (John 1:14).</p><p>The second great thing accomplished by Christ, God&#8217;s Anointed, was that He as God became flesh; that is, He came to be a man in the flesh to be the tabernacle of God among men, bringing God to men to be realized as reality and to be received as grace. Reality is God known and contacted by man, and grace is God received and enjoyed by man. In the fleshly tabernacle which He became, Christ lived with man for thirty-three and a half years, thus fully bringing God to man to be his reality and grace.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being Crucified on the Cross</h2><p>To fulfill God&#8217;s eternal plan, Christ, who is God&#8217;s Anointed, brought God to men in His earthly tabernacle to be contacted by men. After thirty-three and a half years, He went to the cross to be crucified to accomplish the redemption in God&#8217;s eternal plan. This is the third great thing He did, solving, once and for all, the problem of everything that God had condemned in the universe, such as Satan, sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation. He did this for God and for those who are chosen by God, who will eternally inherit His salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being Resurrected from among the Dead</h2><p>Christ gave up His own life, and He Himself took it back by rising from among the dead (John 10:17-18). This is the fourth great thing He did, which accomplished the following three matters pertaining to us:</p><p><b>1) &#8220;Jesus...was raised because of our justification&#8221;</b> (Rom. 4:24-25).</p><p>The death of Christ accomplished redemption for us that we might be justified by God, yet His resurrection is needed to confirm the effectiveness of His death. Therefore, His resurrection is the evidence of our justification.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ...and raised us up together...in Christ Jesus&#8221;</b> (Eph. 2:5-6).</p><p>The resurrection of Christ released God&#8217;s life from within Him for us to receive, making us alive together with Christ and raising us up together.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;Who [God]...has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead&#8221;</b> (1 Pet. 1:3).</p><p>Since Christ resurrected to release His life into us, He regenerated us that we may be a born-again, new man.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON NINE</h1><h1 class="msg">KNOWING CHRIST</h1><h1 class="msg">(2)</h1><h2 class="head2">E. Ascending into the Heavens</h2><p>After Christ rose from among the dead, He ascended into the heavens. This is the fifth great thing done by Him as God&#8217;s anointed One, accomplishing the following two matters for us:</p><p><b>1) &#8220;Having ascended to the height [the heavens], He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men&#8221;</b>  (Eph. 4:8).</p><p>Those taken captive refers to us, who were captured before by Satan and death. Now Christ, in His triumphant resurrection, has captured us from the hands of Satan and death, bringing us to the heavens to make us God&#8217;s gift to Christ that Christ may give us as gifts to the church.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;And seated us together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus&#8221;</b> (Eph. 2:6).</p><p>The ascension of Christ also brought us, who have believed into Him and have been joined to Him to be one, to the heavenlies, that we may attain to a heavenly position and live in a heavenly atmosphere and state.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Fulfilling His Heavenly Ministry</h2><p>Upon His ascension into heaven, Christ proceeded to accomplish His heavenly ministry. He was anointed by God to do this sixth great thing, continually performing the following four matters on our behalf:</p><p><b>1) &#8220;But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry; inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant&#8221;</b> (Heb. 8:6).</p><p>After Christ enacted the new covenant (Matt. 26:28) through His death on the earth, He ascended to the heavens to be the Mediator of this new covenant, executing it upon those who believe in Him.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Who [Christ] sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle&#8221;</b> (Heb. 8:1-2).</p><p>Christ is also the Minister of the true tabernacle in the heavens today, ministering to His believers the heavenly life and the divine, heavenly supply.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God&#8221;</b> (Heb. 4:14).</p><p>Today, Christ is also our great High Priest in the heavens, interceding before God on our behalf that we may be saved to the uttermost (Heb. 7:24-26).</p><p><b>4) &#8220;And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He is a propitiation concerning our sins&#8221;</b> (1 John 2:1-2).</p><p>Christ in the heavens today is also our Advocate before the righteous God. If we sin after we are saved, based upon His being our propitiation, He pleads for us in order to recover the broken fellowship between God and us.</p><h2 class="head2">G. Coming Again</h2><p>When Christ completes His heavenly ministry, He will come back to accomplish the seventh great thing as God&#8217;s Anointed, which includes the following three matters:</p><p><b>1) &#8220;Because the Lord Himself...will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we who are living, who remain, shall be caught up at the same time together with them in clouds into a meeting of the Lord in the air; and so we shall be always together with the Lord&#8221;</b> (1 Thes. 4:16-17).</p><p>Here we are told that when Christ comes again, He will rapture all believers to the air, whether they are resurrected or living, to meet with Him, that they may always be together with Him. This is the first matter He will perform in His second coming.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written, The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob&#8221;</b> (Rom. 11:26).</p><p>This tells us the second thing Christ will perform in His second coming, that is, He will save all of Israel.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;But when the Son of Man comes in His glory... then He shall sit on His throne of glory; and all the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats&#8221;</b> (Matt. 25:31-32).</p><p>This portion of Scripture reveals to us the third matter the Lord will perform when He returns, that is, He will judge all the living unbelieving nations.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Establishing the Millennial Kingdom</h2><p>After Christ cleans up the earth at His coming, He will set up the millennial kingdom. This is the eighth great thing He will accomplish as God&#8217;s anointed One.</p><p><b>1) &#8220;The souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God...and they lived [were resurrected]...and shall reign with Him [Christ] a thousand years&#8221;</b> (Rev. 20:4, 6).</p><p>These verses show us that after Christ comes to the earth, He will establish the millennial kingdom and will reign with His overcoming believers in it for a thousand years.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Being the Center of the New Jerusalem in the New Heaven and the New Earth</h2><p>At the end of the millennial kingdom, the old heaven and the old earth will be abolished. Christ will be the center of eternity in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth to come. This is the last great thing to be done by Christ as God&#8217;s Anointed in fulfilling God&#8217;s eternal purpose. All those redeemed by God throughout the ages will then be with Him, enjoying the bountiful issue of God&#8217;s work throughout the ages in God&#8217;s eternal life forever and ever.</p><p><b>1) &#8220;And the city...the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb&#8221;</b> (Rev. 21:23).</p><p>This verse shows us that in the future in the New Jerusalem of the new heaven and new earth, the unlimited glory of God will shine forth as light with Christ as the lamp, signifying that Christ is the center of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for all eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON TEN</h1><h1 class="msg">KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1><p>The Holy Spirit is the One who brings in the Triune God for our experience and enjoyment. Therefore, we should also know Him that we may richly experience Him.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Baptizing them into...the Father and...the Son and...the Holy Spirit&#8221;</b> (Matt. 28:19).</p><p>In the divine Trinity, the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, is listed last, showing that He is the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE TRIUNE GOD REACHING AND ENTERING INTO THE BELIEVERS</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The Father...will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality&#8221;</b> (John 14:16-17).</p><p>It says here that the Holy Spirit is the Triune God reaching man, that is, the Triune God becoming the Spirit to reach man and be with him forever.<p><b>2) &#8220;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you...and I [the Son] in you&#8221;</b> (John 14:17, 20).</p><p>This word further shows us that the Holy Spirit, who reaches us with the Father and the Son, will also enter into us. This indicates that He is the Triune God entering into the believers. When He enters into us, the Father and the Son enter into us (John 14:23).</p><h2 class="head1">III. WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT IS</h2><p><b>1) The &#8220;Spirit of God&#8221;</b> (Gen. 1:2), participating in God&#8217;s work of creation.</p><p><b>2) The &#8220;Spirit of Jehovah&#8221;</b> (2 Chron. 20:14), participating in God&#8217;s relationship with man (Gen. 2:7).</p><p><b>3) The &#8220;Holy Spirit&#8221;</b> (Luke 1:35), participating in Christ&#8217;s incarnation to sanctify man unto God.</p><p><b>4) The &#8220;Spirit of Jesus&#8221;</b> (Acts 16:7), participating in the birth, the living, and the sufferings of Jesus.</p><p><b>5) The &#8220;Spirit of Christ&#8221;</b> (Rom. 8:9), participating in the resurrection of Christ and the impartation of life.</p><p><b>6) The &#8220;Spirit of Jesus Christ&#8221;</b> (Phil. 1:19), participating in the birth, living, and death of Jesus, as well as in the resurrection of Christ and the impartation of life, with a bountiful supply that the believers may be saved in all things.</p><p><b>7) The &#8220;Spirit of life&#8221;</b> (Rom. 8:2), <b>&#8220;the life-giving Spirit&#8221;</b> (1 Cor. 15:45), participating in Christ being man&#8217;s life and giving man life.</p><p><b>8) &#8220;The Spirit...for the Spirit was not yet [before the resurrection of Christ], because Jesus was not yet glorified [through resurrection]&#8221;</b> (John 7:39).</p><p>The Spirit here is the issue of the Holy Spirit having passed through all the items of what He is, mentioned above. Thus, He is the all-inclusive and consummated Spirit as the ultimate expression of the Triune God to reach and enter into those who believe into Christ.</p><p><b>9) The &#8220;seven Spirits&#8221;</b> (Rev. 1:4), referring to the sevenfold intensified Spirit, that the church in desolation may receive the sevenfold riches of grace and power.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>In the New Testament, there are two aspects of the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, related to the believers. On the one hand, He is the Spirit of life in us to be the essential Spirit of God that we may have the divine life to live and to exist. On the other hand, He is the Spirit of power upon us to be the economical Spirit of God that we may have the divine power and gift to work for God.</p><p><b>1) &#8220;The Spirit of reality...shall be in you&#8221;</b> (John 14:17).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit as the essential Spirit of God in the believers that they may have God&#8217;s life to live for God.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth&#8221;</b> (Acts 1:8).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit as the economical Spirit of God upon the believers that they may receive God&#8217;s power to work for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me [the Son]&#8221;</b> (John 15:26).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit becoming the transfiguration and reality of Christ in His resurrection to testify concerning the reality of Christ in resurrection.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;And having come, He [the Holy Spirit] will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment&#8221;</b> (John 16:8).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit coming to convict sinners of their sins that they may repent and believe into Christ to obtain eternal life.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&#8221;</b> (John 3:6).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit, as God&#8217;s essential Spirit of life, regenerating the repentant sinner in his spirit that he may have the life of God and become a child of God.</p><p><b>4) &#8220;He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit&#8221;</b> (Titus 3:5).</p><p>This is also the Holy Spirit, as God&#8217;s essential Spirit of life, renewing man through regeneration that man may receive God&#8217;s salvation of life.</p><p><b>5) &#8220;The Holy Spirit who dwells in us&#8221;</b> (2 Tim. 1:14).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit, as God&#8217;s essential Spirit of life, abiding in us to continually supply us with God&#8217;s life and riches.</p><p><b>6) &#8220;The anointing which you received from Him [the Son with the Father] abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him&#8221;</b> (1 John 2:27).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit, as the essential Spirit of God, anointing the essence (element) of God into the believers, thus producing a teaching for them that they may abide in the Lord according to the teaching of God&#8217;s essence.</p><p><b>7) &#8220;Having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&#8221;</b> (Rom. 15:16).</p><p>This is also the Holy Spirit, as God&#8217;s essential Spirit of life in the believers, supplying them with God&#8217;s holy nature, that is, the divine essence.</p><p><b>8) &#8220;Being transformed into the same [the Lord&#8217;s] image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&#8221;</b> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p><p>This is still the Holy Spirit, as the essential Spirit of God in the believers, transforming them metabolically with God&#8217;s divine essence into the Lord&#8217;s image from one degree of glory to a higher degree of glory.</p><p><b>9) &#8220;I am sending forth the promise [the Holy Spirit] of My Father upon you...until you are clothed with power from on high [the heavens]&#8221;</b> (Luke 24:49).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit, as the economical Spirit of God, being the power on the believers for them to work for God.</p><p><b>10) &#8220;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit...&#8221;</b> (1 Cor. 12:7-11).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit upon the believers, as the economical Spirit of God, giving them diverse gifts to work for God.</p><h1 class="msg">LESSON ELEVEN</h1><h1 class="msg">KNOWING THE CROSS OF CHRIST</h1><p>The cross of Christ accomplished God&#8217;s eternal redemption for us according to the requirements of God&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, and glory to become the basis of our eternal salvation. Hence, we must thoroughly know the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">I. THE CROSS BEING PROPHESIED BY GOD</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is everyone hanging on a tree&#8221;</b> (Gal. 3:13).</p><p>&#8220;Tree&#8221; here signifies the cross, which was made of wood. In Deuteronomy 21:23 of the Old Testament, God prophesied in the judgments of the Law that Christ would be hung on a tree, that is, be hung on the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CROSS BEING A ROMAN FORM OF EXECUTION</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;They cried out then, Away with him, away with him, crucify him! Pilate [the Roman Governor] says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered. We have no king but Caesar [the Roman Emperor]&#8221;</b> (John 19:15).</p><p>The Jewish form of execution was to stone a criminal to death (Deut. 22:24). However, about sixty years before the Lord&#8217;s birth, the Jewish nation fell to Rome. Not long before the Lord was sentenced to death on the cross by the Roman governor, the Roman Empire had adopted crucifixion as the form of execution for the most evil persons. Thus, when the Jews sought to kill the Lord, they crucified Him through the hands of the Roman governor, fulfilling God&#8217;s prophecy in Deuteronomy 21:23 concerning how the Lord would die. This was done by the sovereign hand of God.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE TIME WHEN CHRIST WAS CRUCIFIED</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Now it was the third hour [9 a.m.], and they crucified Him&#8221;</b> (Mark 15:25).</p><p>Christ was crucified beginning at nine o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;Now from the sixth hour [noon] darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour [3 p.m.]&#8221;</b> (Matt. 27:45).</p><p>Christ was crucified until three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. From nine in the morning to three in the afternoon is a total of six hours. In the first three hours, God did not punish Him in the sinners&#8217; place; it was men persecuting Him. In these three hours, He suffered for martyrdom, not redemption. At noon, the earth became dark. From this point until three o&#8217;clock, it was not men persecuting Him but God judging Him in the sinners&#8217; place. In those three hours, He suffered for redemption, not martyrdom.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE CROSS</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Who Himself carried up our sins [plural, referring to man&#8217;s sins in his outward deeds] in His body onto the tree, in order that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness&#8221;</b> (1 Pet. 2:24).</p><p>The first thing Christ accomplished on the cross was to bear the various sins in our outward actions, that is, the sins committed by a person himself, that we may be saved and pass from death into life.</p><p><b>2) &#8220;But now...He has been manifested for the putting away of sin [singular, referring to man&#8217;s sin in his inward nature] by His sacrifice&#8221;</b> (Heb. 9:26).</p><p>On the cross, at the same time, Christ removed the sin in our inward nature, that is, the sin inherited by birth, that we may be delivered from our sinful nature within.</p><p><b>3) &#8220;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because...Cursed is every one hanging on a tree&#8221;</b> (Gal. 3:13).</p><p>Christ bore our outward sins and removed our inward sin on the cross, receiving the curse which, according to God&#8217;s law, we should have received because of our fall and our sin.</p><p><b>4) &#8220;Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves&#8221;</b> (Rom. 6:6).</p><p>Christ not only dealt with our twofold sin on the cross, He also crucified our sinful old man that the body of sin might be made of none effect, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.</p><p><b>5) &#8220;I have been crucified with Christ&#8221;</b> (Gal. 2:20). &#8220;I&#8221; is our old man. Since our old man has been crucified with Christ, our &#8220;I&#8221; is also crucified with Him.</p><p><b>6) &#8220;But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts&#8221;</b> (Gal. 5:24).</p><p>Not only did Christ crucify our old man on the cross, He also crucified our flesh with its passions and lusts. Here it says that we who are of Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts. We can do this based on the fact that the Lord crucified our flesh on the cross.</p><p><b>7) &#8220;...blood and flesh. He also Himself in like manner shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil; and might release those who through fear of death through all their life were held in slavery&#8221;</b> (Heb. 2:14-15).</p><p>On the cross, Christ destroyed the Devil, who has the might of death, and released us from the slavery of death.</p><p><b>8) &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent [on a pole] in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up [on the cross]; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life&#8221;</b> (John 3:14-15).</p><p>Since Christ destroyed the Devil, who has the power of death, obviously He also judged and dealt with him, the old serpent who had poisoned mankind, that all who believe in Christ may have God&#8217;s eternal life and pass from death into life. This is typified by Moses" lifting up the serpent in the wilderness, which brought the Israelites from death to life.</p><p><b>9) &#8220;Through whom [Christ] the world has been crucified to me&#8221;</b> (Gal. 6:14).</p><p>On the cross, Christ destroyed Satan the Devil, and at the same time He crucified the world organized by Satan and hanging on Satan that the world would lose its usurping power on those who have believed into Christ.</p><p><b>10) &#8220;For He Himself [Christ]...has made both [the Jews and the Gentiles] one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity, having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man&#8221;</b> (Eph. 2:14-15).</p><p>On the cross, Christ abolished the Old Testament law of the commandments in ordinances, which separated the Jews from the Gentiles, making them one and creating the two in Himself into one new man, which is the church.</p><p><b>11) &#8220;Unless a grain of wheat [typifying Christ] falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit [typifying the members of Christ]&#8221;</b> (John 12:24).</p><p>Christ not only dealt with all the above negative items for God and for us on the cross, but through His death on the cross He also released the divine life within Him into us so that we could become His many members which constitute His Body.</p><h2 class="head1">V. BOASTING IN THE CROSS</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221;</b> (Gal. 6:14).</p><p>Those zealous for the Jewish religion forced others to be circumcised in order to boast in others&#8217; flesh (Gal. 6:12-13). However, the Apostle Paul, being gained by Christ, did not boast in anything but the cross of Christ.</p><!--<p class=hbody>2Near the cross, a trembling soul, Love and mercy found me; There the Bright and Morning Star Sheds its beams around me.<p class=hbody>3Near the cross!

Each one of us who is saved participates in this goal, that God may obtain His heart&#8217;s desire according to His good pleasure. Therefore, we must also know the church.</p><h2 class="head1">I. WHAT THE CHURCH IS</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Called Out Assembly</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;On this rock I [Christ] will build My church&#8221;</b> (Matt. 16:18).</p><p>The church is what Christ will build through His death, resurrection, and ascension. The term &#8220;church&#8221; is ekklesia in Greek which means the called out assembly. Thus, according to its literal meaning, the church is the congregation called out from the world by God. It is not a church building or any edifice for the worship of God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Body of Christ</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&#8221;</b> (Eph. 1:22-23).</p><p>The church is the Body with Christ as the Head; it is constituted for Christ in His life and Spirit with all those who have believed into Him. It is a living organism and not a lifeless organization, such as the clubs and associations in society.</p><p>The body of a man is the fullness of a man to be his expression. Likewise, the church is the fullness of Christ to be His expression. Since Christ is the One who is unlimited, extensive, and filling all in all, He needs a great Body to be the fullness of Himself who fills all in all to express Him in all things.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Counterpart of Christ</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her&#8221;</b> (Eph. 5:25).</p><p>This word reveals that the church is also Christ&#8217;s counterpart. As the Body of Christ, the church receives life from Him for His expression; this is a matter of life. As the counterpart of Christ, the church receives His love for the satisfaction of His heart&#8217;s desire; this is a matter of love.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The House of God</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;That you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth [reality]&#8221;</b> (1 Tim. 3:15).</p><p>To Christ, the church is His Body and His counterpart, while to God, the church is His house. On the one hand, this house refers to God&#8217;s dwelling place, and on the other hand, it refers to God&#8217;s family, God&#8217;s household. These two, God&#8217;s household and God&#8217;s dwelling place, are just one. God&#8217;s household is the very house for God&#8217;s dwelling (Eph. 2:19, 22). A person&#8217;s house is his place of living, residing, and rest. The church, being God&#8217;s house, is also such a place to God. Today, the living God is living, residing, and resting in the church on the earth.</p><p>God is living, and the church as His house is also living, having the life of God, living, residing, and resting with God. Thus, the living house of God is the pillar and base of all His reality, which is the reality (truth) of the universe. Everything of this living God is the reality in the universe. Without Him, the universe is vain and empty; yet all His reality is being supported and upheld by the church, which is His living house.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The New Man</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him [Christ] who created him; where [in the new man] there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all [men] and in all [men]&#8221;</b> (Col. 3:10-11).</p><p>Just as all of mankind is a corporate old man created in Adam, the church is also a corporate new man. Christ, having abolished on the cross all the ordinances which caused discord among men, created this new man in Himself (Eph. 2:14-15). This new man bears the image of its Creator, Christ, who is its life and its content. In this new man, there are no persons of the old creation belonging to any race, religion, culture, or class. Only Christ is all the constituents of this new man and is in all its constituents. The church as the Body of Christ takes Christ as its life for His expression; the church as the new man takes Christ as its person for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s will.</p><h2 class="head1">II. THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE CHURCH</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;The church of God...those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints&#8221;</b> (1 Cor. 1:2).</p><p>The church is constituted with all those who have believed into Christ and who possess His life. Any person who has not believed into Christ and has not been saved cannot become a constituent of the church. Without being saved, even our closest relatives are not constituents of the church. Only after they are saved and have the Lord&#8217;s life to become saints are they constituents of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Universal Aspect</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;On this rock I [Christ] will build My church&#8221;</b> (Matt. 16:18).</p><p>The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the universal aspect. It is unique, including all who have believed into Him in the universe through all the ages and in every place.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Local Aspect</h2><p><b>1) &#8220;If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church&#8221;</b> (Matt. 18:17).</p><p>The church mentioned by the Lord in this verse is in the local aspect. It is numerous and its local believers can speak to it. According to the local aspect, the church appears in every locality. Each local church includes only those who have believed into Christ in that place.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE DESIGNATION OF THE CHURCH</h2><h2 class="head2">A. It Has No Special Name</h2><p>The church is unique and has no need of special names. The church is the church; there should not be kinds of churches that are denominated according to their kind, such as the Presbyterian church, the Lutheran church, and the Baptist church. To denominate the church in this way is needless and not according to the biblical revelation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. It May Be Designated by the Name of Its Locality</h2><p>Although the church is unique in the universe, it is numerous in its local manifestation. The many local churches do not differ in nature; their difference is only in the different places where they are. Therefore, we may use the name of the locality in which a local church is to designate that church, such as the church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), and the seven local churches in the province of Asia (Rev. 1:4, 11).</p></body></html>
