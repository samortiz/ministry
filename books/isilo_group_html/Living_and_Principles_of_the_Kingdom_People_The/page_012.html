<p>In verse 16 the Lord said, &ldquo;In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; The light of the kingdom people should shine before men like a city situated on a mountain and like a lamp placed on a lampstand. On the one hand, they are delivered from the natural element and from corruption. On the other hand, they are filled with oil, submit to the authority of the heavens, and are preserved from the covering of making a living and doing business. As a result, when their light shines, men see their good works and glorify the Father who is in the heavens.</p>
<p>In Mark 14:6 the Lord praised Mary by saying, &ldquo;She has done a noble deed on Me.&rdquo; Titus 2:14 says that the Lord has redeemed us from all lawlessness and purified to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works. The Greek words translated as &ldquo;good works&rdquo; in Matthew 5:16 are the same Greek words that are translated as &ldquo;noble deed&rdquo; in Mark 14:6 and as &ldquo;good works&rdquo; in Titus 2:14. Hence, the good works in Matthew 5:16 refer to a good, proper, and righteous conduct. Such good works are the conduct that is under the ruling of the heavens. They are the conduct of created men who are delivered from natural goodness and corruption to live out God. When people see this conduct, they will glorify the Father who is in the heavens.</p>
<p>The people who see such conduct glorify the Father who is in the heavens because such good, proper, and righteous conduct expresses and lives out God. If the disciples of Confucius could reach their ultimate goal, they would live out only human goodness. As a result, others would feel only that they are good, but God&rsquo;s glory would not be seen. The kingdom people, however, are different. The kingdom people live out God under the ruling of the heavens. They express God. Therefore, other people see the glory of God, which is God expressed. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the expression of God. Hence, the Bible says that He is &ldquo;the effulgence of His glory and the impress of His substance&rdquo; (Heb. 1:3). The kingdom people live out God in the same way that the Lord Jesus lived out God. As a result, people do not only see their good conduct; people also see the expressed God and thus glorify the Father who is in the heavens. It is crucial for us to realize that the kind of good works that glorify God are the works that live out God and express God. I hope that we will be deeply impressed with this point.</p>
<p>According to Matthew 5:16, glory is given not to the God who is in the heavens but to the Father who is in the heavens. When the Bible speaks of God, the emphasis is on His being the Creator. When it speaks of the Father, the emphasis is on His being our begetting Father. If God were only God, He could not be expressed through us. In order to be expressed through us, He must also be the Father to beget us by putting life into us (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>In Matthew 5 through 7 the Lord rarely spoke of God, but He constantly spoke of the Father. This is a matter of life. The kingdom people are born of God to have God as their Father. Hence, when they live by trusting in God, they have the Father&rsquo;s glory in them and are able to glorify the Father who is in the heavens.</p>
<p>In the phrase <em>Father who is in the heavens</em> the word <em>Father</em> is related to life, but the word <em>heavens</em> is related to authority. Daniel 4:26 says, &ldquo;The heavens do rule.&rdquo; This indicates that the heavens imply authority. The conduct of the kingdom people is the living out of the Father&rsquo;s life and is also produced out of the ruling of the heavens.</p>
<p>When the kingdom people are delivered from natural goodness and corruption, are filled with oil, and are subject to the ruling of the heavens, they will have a certain living and conduct. The people who see this living will sense the expression of God and the flavor of the ruling of the heavens. Such a living and conduct are not of men but of God. Such a living is not earthly but heavenly. Such a living is the issue of the ruling and the controlling of the heavens and results in people glorifying the Father who is in the heavens.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Living and Principles of the Kingdom People &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
