   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MISSING THE MARK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now I come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From what I have seen in going out to look at the situation and from what I have heard in fellowship from others, I have wondered if maybe the best we have is just like the Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Probably compared to a proper Brethren assembly, some local churches are inferior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are loose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We act in a loose way under the cloak of liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Lee told us we are against religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must not be bound by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is wonderful not to be religious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But what, positively speaking, do we want to be?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Brothers, I believe you understand me when I say that at best we are like Brethren assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no need to say that some churches are even inferior to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This troubles me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It burdens me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was checked by the Lord and even by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What are you doing here?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Is it just to see that churches are raised up?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What kind of churches?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Apart from the general attendants at the church meetings, do even the leading ones have a clear vision to direct and protect them, to safeguard them from distraction?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Last week I spent a long time praying over all the points of the messages I have given these past twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I prayed about them in order to check.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more I prayed, the more I felt confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I tell you, I have the full assurance that what I have been sharing is what is on the Lord s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However strong the opposition is against me, I believe the Lord has told me that this is what He wants and that I must let the saints and the brothers know that if they do not have this, they are not in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s center in His economy has been revealed and written in the Scriptures for close to two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through all these centuries quite a few books have been published to unfold this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet very few of even the lovers, the seekers, of the Lord have really seen this and lived a life for this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is hard to find Christians who are really in this focus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>HOLDING THE MYSTERY OF THE FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The churches in the United States have been in existence for quite some time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Most were not raised up recently.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of those of you who are here with me now, I would say that over ninety percent of you have been in the Lord s recovery over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As far as the actual and practical church life is concerned, I am burdened that there is not much evidence that the churches are such a testimony to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I don t mean that in every meeting we talk only about the central lane, the focus, God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I mean that we have a church life which is a testimony to what Paul calls the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers, I would ask you humbly, look around at our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What was there in 1982?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Don t you realize that there are signs indicating we have somewhat missed the focus?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There were gospel preaching, exposition of the Bible even though using the Life-study messages , and meeting according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But have we I speak from the depths of my being; I change the word we to you, singular you have you really seen a vision of God s eternal purpose, a vision of God s economy, of what God wants?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have been fighting for Christ being the Spirit and for the Triune God being not for doctrine but for experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some of you may think, Oh, this is Brother Lee s thought.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He always speaks on this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not do this from habit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I were only a Bible teacher, I have sixty-six books from which to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the Lord has shown me that this would not be of His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He doesn t want me to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Revelation the churches are called lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The lampstands represent the Triune God with the Father as the nature, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the church: the Father s nature plus the Son s embodiment plus the Spirit s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And this should be the very essence of the church s shining.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the light that the church shines forth?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What is the testimony which shines out from the church?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It must be the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not say that in every meeting this is the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But whatever we fellowship about, whatever we minister, there must be such a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In everything we do gospel preaching, Bible teaching, visiting the saints, and even visiting new ones not yet saved we must bear a clear, evident, strong testimony of a lampstand constituted of the Father s nature, the Son s embodiment, and the Spirit s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What do we express in our gospel preaching?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What do we express in our love feasts?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What do we express in our conversation in our daily Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must bear such a testimony in every aspect of the church life and of our daily life, including the family life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To bear such a testimony is to hold the mystery of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Mystery here does not denote a doctrine; even the word faith doesn t mean doctrine here.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As you know, the faith is the reality of the content of the New Testament economy of God in which we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our belief is not in doctrines but in such a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of this faith, which is the content of God s New Testament economy, there is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In using this word mystery, Paul refers first to Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and second to the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>According to the context of 1 Timothy 3:9, the mystery of the faith should also include the church life cf. v. 16 . Why? Because the church life is constituted of God in Christ and of Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This corresponds to the constitution of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As the lampstand is constituted of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, so the church also is constituted of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The church life is not something organized.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is not even something composed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is a living organism constituted of the living God in His divine Trinity the Father s nature, the Son s embodiment, and the Spirit s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is not only the church; it is also the church life, the church s living.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus it is a golden lampstand shining out the testimony of the Triune God.</S>
