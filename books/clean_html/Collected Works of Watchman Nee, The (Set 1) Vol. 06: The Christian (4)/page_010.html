<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LAMB OF THE PASSOVER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 12</H1><P>God's people, the Israelites, were enslaved in Egypt for many years. God saw their affliction and brought down ten plagues upon the Egyptians to punish them so that they would release His chosen people. After nine plagues had passed, the Egyptians were still hard-hearted. They did not want to lose their slaves. Therefore, God sent down the last plague to show His wondrous might and accomplish His deliverance.</P><P>We want to see how the last plague shows us the way of our salvation. God told the Israelites that He had decreed that all the firstborn in the land of Egypt should die. Whether the firstborn of an Israelite or Egyptian, God had decreed that they should die. "All the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die" (Exo. 11:5). But God established a way of salvation. He told the Israelites that every household should prepare a lamb without blemish, kill the lamb, put its blood in a basin, and with a bunch of hyssop strike the blood on the two side posts and upper doorpost of each house. At midnight the angel of the Lord would pass through the land of Egypt and smite all the firstborn in houses that did not have the blood of the lamb on the side posts and upper doorpost. By midnight Jehovah had smitten the firstborn of many Egyptians in the houses which did not have the blood of the lamb on the side posts and upper doorpost. Those who did not die denote those who are saved, while those who died denote those who are perishing.</P><P>We should realize that all the firstborn in Egypt should have died. Egypt was under God's judgment. The Israelites were also under God's judgment. The firstborn typifies all sinners (1 Cor. 15:46). Egypt typifies the world, and Pharaoh typifies the devil. All sinners who live in the world and have become the slaves of the devil are under God's judgment. They will all receive God's punishment, eternal death. All have sinned and there is no distinction (Rom. 3:22-23). The wages of sin is death (Rom. 6:23). My dear sinners, please do not take this matter lightly. Do not forget this! You are a sinner, your sins will be punished, and this punishment is eternal perdition and suffering in the lake of fire. You ought to consider your sins more! You ought to consider the punishment that awaits you! Regardless of whether you attend a church, the wrath of God is always upon you unless you are saved and delivered from your sins (John 3:36). O sinners! Do not forget that God is righteous. He surely will judge sins.</P><P>Nevertheless, we are not without hope; there is still a way to salvation. Although we do not have a way by ourselves, God has a way. There is no other way of salvation except God's way. The Bible says, "Neither is there another name [but Jesus] under heaven given among men in which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). He told the Israelites to prepare a lamb. This lamb was their savior. The blood of the lamb saved them from death.</P><P>This lamb of the Passover signifies our Lord Jesus Christ, for the Scripture says, "For our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed" (1 Cor. 5:7). "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29). "You were redeemed...with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ" (1 Pet. 1:18-19). In the past God saved the Israelites with the lamb. Now He is saving us through the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is our Lamb. The Israelites were saved by the lambs and we are saved by the Lord Jesus.</P><P>Do you want to be saved? If not, there is nothing more to say. But if you know that you are a sinner under the judgment of God and cannot escape His righteous judgment, and you wish to be saved, there is a saving way. God has prepared a salvation. He wants to save you.</P><P>The Lord Jesus has been crucified on the cross for our sins. Salvation has been accomplished, and whoever accepts Him as their personal Savior will be saved. The Israelites could not be saved by any other means. They relied on the blood of the lambs. Similarly, only the precious blood of the Lord Jesus can save you. Only the precious blood can save sinners!</P><P>Suppose that I could go back in time with you to the house of an Israelite. (Of course, this is only hypothetical.) Suppose we found a father and son sitting comfortably at home, and I asked him, "I heard that God is going to kill your son at midnight tonight. Why are you still sitting here comfortably? Aren't you afraid of death?"</P><P>The man might answer, "We have nothing to fear, for God has prepared a lamb for us, and the lamb can save our lives. Look at my lamb! How fat! How white! How attractive! How lovable! And listen to the pleasing sound he makes! My lamb is the best; the lambs of my neighbors are not as good as mine. Since I have such a nice, good, and kind lamb, what more do I fear?"</P><P>What he said seems to be correct, but I tell you, at midnight his son will die! He will be killed by the angel of God!</P><P>Why? Has the word of God come in vain? Does he not have a lamb?</P><P>Indeed, he has a lamb. But God wants a dead lamb, not a living one. Let me tell you, a living Lord Jesus cannot save us; only a crucified Lord Jesus can save us. While the Lord Jesus was living on earth, He could not save us. Only after He was crucified could He redeem us. Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Galilee are places that condemn us; only Golgotha is the place which gives us eternal life. Do not marvel at this statement. Many people claim that Jesus is our model, a great man and a great teacher. Others think of Him as a man of good behavior, good morals, noble humanity, and great might. But, let me tell you, the more excellent the Lord Jesus is, the more your inadequacy is exposed! His goodness cannot save you; it will only condemn you! When God sees Him, God is satisfied. Although we may try our best to imitate Him, the more we try, the more our inward sinful nature and outward evil acts demonstrate our unworthiness. Our conduct will never please God. The more we imitate, the more we find that we will not and cannot imitate Him.</P>
