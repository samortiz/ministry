 <h2 class="head2">C. Baptism Being for the Washing Away of Sins</h2>
<p>Let us consider the case of Paul. Ananias came to Paul and said to him, &ldquo;Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name&rdquo; (Acts 22:16).</p>
<p>Paul was the foremost and greatest teacher, prophet, and apostle of Christianity. Was there a little error in his experience? Sometimes we preach the right doctrines but have the wrong experience. What would happen when we gave our testimony? What would happen if others did the same thing we do? The testimony of a teacher is very important because it may mislead others. Could it be that the experience of the foremost teacher of Christianity was wrong?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on His name.&rdquo; Please take note of this verse. It says that baptism can wash away one&rsquo;s sins. The Catholics quote this verse and regard it as a personal matter before God. The error of Catholicism lies in saying, &ldquo;If <em>you</em> are baptized, <em>your</em> sins will be washed away.&rdquo; Therefore, they claim that a death-bed baptism can wash away sins. They do not realize that the significance of this matter is not before God but before the world.</p>
<p>Formerly, Paul was a man in the world. After he had believed in the Lord Jesus and had seen Him, he needed to rise up and be baptized. The moment he was baptized, his sins were washed away. The moment he severed his relationship with the world, his sins were gone. If you are a Christian secretly and are not baptized, the world may still consider you as one of them. You may say that you are saved, but the world will not admit it. You may say that you have believed in the Lord Jesus, but they will say that they have not seen it. Once you get into the water, they will see it; they will know that you have believed in Jesus. Otherwise, why should a person be so foolish as to get into the water? The moment you are baptized, you are freed from the world. Water baptism is a severance of one&rsquo;s relationship with the world.</p>
<p>If a person believes in his heart but does not have any outward gesture, the world will still consider him to be part of it. For instance, in Kuling of Fukien there is a strong tradition of idol worship every fall; everyone is required to donate some money. If a person merely says that he has believed in the Lord, others will not believe him. But the moment he is baptized, they will know that he is no longer one of them. Therefore, baptism is the best way to free oneself from the world. If you want to be freed from the world, you must be baptized. You must tell the world, &ldquo;My relationship with you is over.&rdquo; By doing this, you come out of the world.</p>
<p>Baptism is an open testimony, and we should not be afraid to let others witness it. Unbelievers can also be present during our baptism. Recently, when we baptized some people in Foochow, a brother said, &ldquo;We do not like to conduct the baptism meeting in such a messy way. There were too many spectators.&rdquo; If this is the case, John the Baptist would have to learn from this brother because John conducted baptisms that were not that orderly. Even the baptisms of the three thousand on the day of Pentecost were not that orderly. The issue is not whether a meeting is orderly. Of course, it is not good to be disorderly. But all the brothers and sisters should know what we are doing. When we baptize someone, we should let the whole world witness what we are doing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Baptism Leading to Salvation through Water</h2>
<p>The Scripture is consistent in its principles. First Peter 3:20 says, &ldquo;In the days of Noah...a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water.&rdquo; This verse shows us again that baptism leads to salvation. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; On the day of Pentecost, Peter said, &ldquo;Be baptized...for the forgiveness of your sins.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s action shows us that when a person is baptized, his sins are washed away. They are not just forgiven, but washed away. This is because our sins are washed away when we sever our relationship with the world. Here, the word in 1 Peter also shows us that we are saved through water. Therefore, baptism leads to salvation through water.</p>
<p>Those who cannot pass the test of water are not saved. A person who cannot pass through water drowns. During Noah&rsquo;s time, everyone was baptized, but only eight souls came out. All the people were baptized and immersed in the water, but only eight souls emerged from it. In other words, the water became the water of death to some, but to others it was the water of salvation. Others go into the water and remain there, but we pass through the water and emerge from it. There is something positive in Peter&rsquo;s word. When the flood came, everyone drowned. Only the eight souls in the ark, whom the water could not overcome, emerged from it. While the rest perished, these eight souls were saved. Today the whole world is under the wrath of God. For one to be baptized today means that he goes through God&rsquo;s wrath. But he does not only go through it; he comes out of it. His emergence from it shows that he is one who has come out. This is baptism.</p>
<p>Baptism is being immersed on one side and emerging out of water on the other side. Baptism means passing through and emerging from the water. You must emphasize the aspect of &ldquo;emergence.&rdquo; Everyone went into the water, but only the eight souls came out. Today we are saved through baptism. What does this mean? When I am baptized, I do not go into the water and remain there. Rather, I enter into the water and emerge from it. If you have never believed in the Lord Jesus, your baptism will not result in an emergence. Today my going into the water and coming out of it means that I am different from you. I can come out from the world through the water. I testify to others that I am different from the world.</p>
