   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Subsisting in the Form of God,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>in Equality with God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking of Christ, Philippians 2:6 says, Who subsisting in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word translated subsisting denotes existing from the beginning; it implies Christ s eternal preexistence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word form refers to the expression, not the fashion, of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is identified with the essence and nature of God s person and thus expresses His essence and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This refers to Christ s deity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to this verse, Christ is equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Mystery of God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of the mystery of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see that Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Embodied in Christ is all that God is and has.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the mystery of God, Christ is the embodiment, definition, and explanation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All that God intends to do is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word mystery in Colossians 2:2 may be interpreted as meaning story.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the mystery of God Christ is the story of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the embodiment of God, the effulgence of God s glory, and the express image of God s substance, Christ, the mystery of God, His story, defines, explains, and expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, God has a history, a story.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although God is eternal, He also has a history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, to say that God has a history is to speak in human terms for our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the history of God, the story of God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is infinite and eternal, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the beginning, in eternity past, God had a good pleasure, the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Based on this good pleasure, which is the desire of His heart, God made a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The biblical term for this plan is purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is purposeful; He has an eternal purpose based on His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This purpose is to have a group of living beings to be His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to His good pleasure, God created the heavens and the earth and all the billions of items in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, God accomplished the work of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the story, the history, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that Christ is not only God Himself He is also God s history.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s history refers to the process through which He has passed so that He may dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The fact that Christ is the mystery of God indicates that He is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the contrary, He is immeasurable and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be sure, God is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is unlimited, infinite, eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How, then, could Christ, the mystery of God, be simple?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the mystery of God, Christ is the immeasurable, infinite, and eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God Himself is a mystery, and Christ is the mystery of this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since Christ is the mystery of God, if we know Christ, we know God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we do not know Christ, we do not have the way to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may say that Christ is the key that opens up the way into God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we have Christ, God is open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ as the mystery of God is the explanation, interpretation, and definition of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through Him we know God and even are brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His being the Son of God implies the expression of God, the issue, or the coming out, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Concerning God s existence, Christ is the complete God as God s embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that as far as existence is concerned, Christ is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But concerning God s issue, His coming out, Christ is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is an important difference between Christ as the embodiment of God and as the issue of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ as the embodiment of God is related to His existence, whereas Christ as the Son of God is related to the coming out, the issue, the expression, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John 20:31 says, These have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This verse indicates that the purpose of the Gospel of John is to testify that Jesus is the Christ 1:41; 4:25, 29; 7:41-42 and the Son of God 1:34, 49; 9:35; 10:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the title of the Lord according to His office, His mission.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Son of God is His title according to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His person is a matter of God s life, and His mission is a matter of God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is the Son of God to be the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Matthew 16:16 Peter, receiving a revelation from the Father, declared, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have seen that the Christ, the anointed One of God, refers to the Lord s commission, whereas the Son of the living God, as the second of the Triune God, refers to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His commission is to accomplish God s eternal purpose through His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and second advent, whereas His person embodies the Father and issues in the Spirit for a full expression of the Triune God.</S>
