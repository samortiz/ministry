   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Abandoning the Old Ways</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Adopting Scientific Ways</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even though we are all burdened for the gospel in the schools, it is futile for me to explain how to spread the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, our concepts need to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My fellowship can be compared to a coach teaching a team how to play basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The team must first learn how to dribble.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1953 I held a training in Taipei and spoke on thirty points of character, which included being genuine, exact, strict, diligent, broad, and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I taught the saints, point by point, how to be proper persons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not know how to be a proper person, we can never know how to do things, and if we do not know how to do things, we can never labor for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a large fishpond in front of us, and the resources of the church, including the brothers and sisters, are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we should not think that this provision is sufficient in order for us to succeed in the gospel work in schools.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must find the right methods and not go according to our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have not learned how to play the piano can still play it, but they play in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their way of playing is not appropriate; it is not melodious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When learning to play the piano, one has to learn the scales and practice for one to two hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After several years of daily practice, a person can play melodiously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sisters who play the hymns play in a proper way, without wild movements.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do we labor in a way that is similar to the way in which people who have taken lessons play the piano?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most of us labor in a natural way, without much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can we expect such labor to bring results?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How can we expect the church to be strong?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you were to ask me to be the principal of an elementary school or a university, I can guarantee you that the school would close within three years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if I study education and apply scientific methods to running the school, nearly every parent would want to send their children to the school.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the past decades we have not made much progress in the work concerning propagation or spread.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thirty-five years ago there were only four hundred saints on the island; in less than ten years the number increased to forty thousand saints in fifty localities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Twenty years have gone by since then.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Frankly speaking, we are merely maintaining the old fa ade.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not propagating or spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This must not continue.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this day and age it is no longer acceptable to run a school according to the old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sixty years ago I studied accounting in a professional school run by Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then I worked as an accounting clerk for a Chinese customs office.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now even accounting terminology has progressed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Almost all the old accounting terminology in Chinese has been phased out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This proves that everyone seeks progress.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The principles in accounting have remained the same, but the application has improved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is also true in mathematics.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The principles in mathematics have not changed, but the way mathematics is taught has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even the elementary school textbooks have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No one can change the fact that two plus two is four, but the way to teach this fact can be progressively improved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why have we not improved the way we labor?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>People are traveling in the 747 Jumbo Jet, but we are still riding on an ox cart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To continue in this way is to shut our doors, thinking that we are doing all right, without paying attention to the advancements all around us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eleven years ago I began to devote all my energy to writing the notes for the New Testament and the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After I finished the last book the book of Acts I said that I would return to Taiwan and begin the labor anew.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord has truly blessed the churches here with a good environment and rich resources.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is regrettable that we are holding on to the old ways and not making progress.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Studying, Laboring, and Improving</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must take a new approach in the work and abandon the old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to study a new and scientific way to change the way that we labor and make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How can we achieve a tenfold increase on the campuses?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot guarantee that we will succeed initially.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only the Lord can create something from nothing; we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What we can do is to study, to labor, and to improve daily.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I hope that the older brothers and sisters would be energized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not say that Brother Lee is developing some strange ways to lead us and that we did not do these things in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one can guarantee that the way we take will have success, but we would like to see success.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We do not want our rich resources to go to waste with no results year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I have been in fellowship with the brothers in Taiwan for more than five years, and many matters have been brought up in my concern for the situation here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now may the Lord cover me with His precious blood as I ask how we will proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not have any set plans.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We only feel that our work needs to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our maintaining the status quo year after year is hindering the Lord and His move.</S>
