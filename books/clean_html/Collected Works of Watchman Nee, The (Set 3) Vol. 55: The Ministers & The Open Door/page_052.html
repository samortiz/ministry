<h2 class="head1">ARRANGEMENT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD (YIYANG)</h2><h2 class="head2">Practicing Not Having Anything for Oneself</h2><p>The locality of Yiyang has made the following arrangements:</p><p>1) The food in the Household will be the same for everyone. (Those who are physically weak will have special allotments.)</p><p>2) The clothing in the Household will be entirely in the principle of "adorn...in proper clothing." We all have been constrained by the Lord's love to practice the principle of handing oneself over and to have everything in common. We receive items and return them to the saints according to each one's need. We keep the extra to make up the lack of those who have nothing. If there is anything left after the distribution, we give it to the storage service group and then distribute to the saints as time goes on. If some are cold or are ill, we contribute extra clothes to meet their special needs.</p><p>3) In the matter of work, we make arrangements according to age, strength, ability, and the gifts which God has given them. From the oldest to the youngest, all have their area of assignment. We hope that none would be idle.</p><p>4) Our time schedule is as follows: We have morning watch and prayer from 5:00 to 6:30 in the morning. We eat breakfast at 7:00. We work from 8:00 to 12:00. We eat lunch after work. We work again from 1:00 to 5:00. We eat dinner at 5:30. We meet and read the Bible from 6:30 to 8:30. We turn the lights off at 9:00.</p><p>5) We fellowship with the other communities that have migrated out in the following ways: a) We have financial fellowship. b) We help them farm for a short period of time.</p><p>Presently, we are a little short in our food budget. This is not a problem. We think it is best to be a little short. Our lack causes God to give us more. It is a way for God to manifest His doings.</p><p>The fields in Kueixi are twice as rich as those in Yiyang. Four or five days ago, we went to Yingtan two times to look things over. It has a very good water supply. It has wood, bamboo, and lime, and straw is plentiful. It would be very convenient to build houses there. The soil is twice as rich as that of the fields in Kueixi and three times as good as the soil in Yiyang.</p><p>We hope to set things up in one locality after another according to the little light God has given us and to inform you as we go. I often make mistakes. I really need the elder brothers to support me in prayer and give me much direction.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Feng He-ren<br />February 13, 1950</p>
