   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE LIVING BY THE LORD TALKS 11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:January 22, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prayer: Lord, what we need is not some passing excitement, stirring up, or exhortation, but the remaining work of the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not want to be ahead of You, nor do we want to be behind You.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May we be filled with You within.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>LIVING BY THE LORD'S LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we need today is not merely that we do not live for ourselves, but that we do not live ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to work not by ourselves, but by the Lord who lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not realize this, we will still trust in our own strength, and we will work according to our own preference.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All works should be initiated by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No human efforts are of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After we are saved, the Lord's love revives us and causes us to live for the Lord and to consecrate ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the beginning of our spiritual revival.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ultimately, however, what the Spirit does is to lead us to know the life within us and to live by this life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, our hearts must love the Lord, and we must be in fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, we should act promptly according to the sense we have within.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not work according to outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we should work according to the inner sense we have received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we are revived, we will surely take God's work as our center.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But God must work on us to the extent that we realize that it is not enough to do the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must also ask by what strength we are doing the work and whether or not God's life is our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After a man is revived and sees God's work and His needs, he will try to do something hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, God must eventually bring him to a place where he works by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Outwardly, there does not seem to be very much difference between the two things, but only those who do not know God would think that the difference is an insignificant one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE KEY TO MINISTERING TO OTHERS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>TO HELP THEM TO KNOW AND EXPERIENCE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In matters concerning God's life, there is a question of degree of depth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Experientially, a person can go through three stages: 1 salvation, 2 revival, and 3 life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only those who have passed through these three stages of experiences can help others in these areas.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The basis of the help we render to others is our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must work according to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only when we are taking the lead in the front will others follow us at the back.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many like to hear teaching concerning revival, but few like to hear the teaching concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the past, many people thought that the teaching of life is the teaching of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Most likely, these people know about the knowledge and experience of life in terminology only.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Most people think that what God wants is excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What God did in China in the past was mainly gospel work and revival work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is a world of difference between revival and life; this difference is greater than the difference between high school and college.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Revival is only a means; it is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is only the procedure; the goal is life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we fellowship with the Lord, live according to the sense of life, and go along with this sense, the more we will be initiated into God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The help we render to others all revolves around these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If others ask, "How should such-and-such a passage of the Scriptures be expounded?" you should answer, "If you want to know about Bible exposition, go to the seminaries."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If others ask about such things as baptism and head covering, you should return the question to them by asking if they have believed in the Lord, and if they have been fellowshipping with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You should ask if they are under any authority, and if they have the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If others ask whether this meeting is better or that meeting is better, you should tell them that everything depends on whether or not a person can meet God in a meeting, and whether or not a meeting can satisfy a person's inner need.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What we care for is how many people are living by the Lord.</S>
