   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SETTLED ON THE GROUND OF THE UNIQUE UNITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We also need to see that the church has its definite ground the ground of the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the ground not merely of unity but of the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today there are many different kinds of unities.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only one unity is the unique unity; all other unities are divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to have a clear vision concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I can say with full assurance that only when you are settled with this unique ground of unity will your Christian life be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are not settled regarding the ground, you will be continually wandering and changing your tune.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today you have one tune, but tomorrow your tune will change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You will not be settled and your tune will not be constant until you are settled with and on the ground of the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You need to see that the church is the desire of God's heart, and you need to see that the church is practical and local.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then you need to see that among so many divisions and in the midst of so much confusion, there is the definite standing of the church, and this standing is the ground of the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you see these things, you will not care about how many others will come to this ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You will realize that, as far as you are concerned, as long as you are on this ground, you are settled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You are like the Israelites who came back to Jerusalem and who became settled there.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to see such a vision of the church that we become settled on the ground of the unique unity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF THE CHURCH AND THE VISION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After we have seen the vision of Christ and the vision of the church, we need to see the vision of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may be wondering what the difference is between the vision of the church and the vision of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By the Lord's mercy many of us have been brought to the ground of the church and are now practicing the church life on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we have been brought to a realization of the ground of the unique unity, we still need the realization of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to see the vision that we are members of the Body and that we need to be built up together and related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not sufficient just to be brought to a realization concerning the church ground, but on this definite ground we need to be built up as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The three main portions of the New Testament which speak of the Body are Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and Ephesians 4.</S>
