   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Daniel 8:10 says, And it grew great, even to the host of heaven Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The little horn will not only grow great to the south, to the east, and to the beautiful land, but even to the host of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How proud he will be!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all know that man has succeeded in landing on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This space technology may enable Antichrist to do something involving the host of heaven, including the planets and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Antichrist will be so arrogant, great, and proud that he will even presume to touch the host of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>D. Casting Down Some of the Host</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>and of the Stars to the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>and Stamping upon Them</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Daniel 8:10 also says that the little horn cast down some of the host and of the stars to the earth, and stamped upon them Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What a person he will be!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Something will be developed in the scientific field that will enable Antichrist to bring down the heavenly host.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Antichrist will be so proud that he will dare to do even this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>E. Magnifying Himself</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even to the Prince of the Host</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Daniel 8:11 says, Yea, he magnified himself even to the Prince of the host, and verse 25 says, He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that he will exalt himself against God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>F. Taking Away the Continual Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The little horn will also take away the continual sacrifice v. 11 . This means that he will stop the worship of God by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have seen that Antichrist will change the Jewish feasts and laws.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now we see that he will discontinue the daily, or continual, sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 12 says, And a time of trial was appointed unto the continual sacrifice by reason of transgression Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the sacrifice will suffer a trial because of Antichrist s interference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This trial will be due to the Jews transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Jews who have returned to the land of their fathers are presently in a very poor situation, full of sins and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This condition will continue until the time of Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the Jews will worship God by offering sacrifices to Him, they will still be sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, God will be disgusted with their offerings, and, due to their transgression, He will allow Antichrist to cause the sacrifices to cease.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>G. Casting Down the Place of the Sanctuary</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>of the Prince of the Host</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Antichrist, the little horn, will also cast down the place of the sanctuary of the Prince of the host Dan 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that he will destroy the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It also implies that the temple will be rebuilt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If Antichrist would appear today, there would be no temple for him to tear down.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that the temple will be rebuilt before long.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Soon after that, Antichrist will rise up and tear it down once again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>H. Casting Down the Truth</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>to the Ground</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Daniel 8:12 also reveals that Antichrist will cast down the truth to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that with Antichrist there will be no truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He will abolish and tear down every truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The tendency of the world situation today is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As far as international relations is concerned, there is very little truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>With regard to the renouncing of all truth, Antichrist will go to the farthest extreme.</S>
