   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING GOSPEL VISITATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Gospel visitation is also an important work of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have to pay attention to a number of points: How do we knock on others' doors?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should be our attitude when we meet others?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How should we conduct ourselves in our speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How should we respond to different kinds of people?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How should we respond when we have the answer, and how should we respond when we do not have the answer?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What should our manner be?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How long should we stay in someone's home?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It should be half an hour at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The responsible brothers have to consider these things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we meet the gospel friends, we can say, "I am coming to you on behalf of the church; the church cares for you and has heard that you have believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are very happy about it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church has sent me to visit you."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The visiting ones do not necessarily have to pass on any teaching; they can simply give their own testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the friends have some problems, there is no need to answer everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just say, "I myself have believed in the Lord for only two months.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am also a learner."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If many people can rise up to do this work, there will be less idle ones in the church cf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matt 20:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For visitation, there is the need of training.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The trainers and the leaders must pray and consider much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before assigning brothers and sisters to the visitation work, they should seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They should know how to lead the saints in this work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they encounter difficulties, they should fellowship, pray, and seek solutions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The same is true with the overseers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the visitation work is done in a hurry and if the visitors are not exercised before the Lord, it will be easy to offend others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It may even cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if it is conducted in a careful way, everything will be covered adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A WORD OF EXHORTATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The brothers have to bear responsibility for carrying out the above points.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have to consider much before the Lord and pray much before making any assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have to be strict before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are strict, you will not be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You have to present all the things before the Lord one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you want to work at all, you have to work properly, systematically, and in a dedicated way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not think that any way is just as good as another as long as it is done by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In addition to exercising your spirit, you have to work according to the right principles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The most important principle in the work is not being slothful in zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who are slothful will not accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that none of you will be slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God grants mercy and adds more people, you will feel that twenty-four hours are not enough to do your work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>MEETINGS FOR BUSINESS AFFAIRS</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every week you have to schedule a meeting for business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This meeting is harder to conduct than a message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes one does not know how he can release his burden through the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the burden remains locked up inside, it becomes a condemnation to the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there are too many affairs to take care of in such a meeting, the burden becomes correspondingly heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason you have to come together to pray first.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You have to open up your spirit to cast your care on God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your spirit has to be unfettered.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then you must consider carefully and think through everything before God before discussing it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The meeting for business affairs should be separated from the meeting for Bible study.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not mix the two things together.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They must be separate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do everything with a single heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A man is limited in his mental capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even the combined effort and energy of a few people are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the reason you must work with singleness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You must study the Bible with singleness of heart, and you must fellowship about business affairs with singleness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you mix these two things together, you will accomplish nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>THE MEETING FOR EVANGELISTS</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In addition to these meetings, there is sometimes the need to have a meeting for evangelists.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Before and after every such gospel meeting, there is the need of thorough prayer, fellowship, and evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you do this, the church will become powerful in the gospel.</S>
