<h2 class="head2">The Need of More Full-Time Workers</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is in need of more full-time workers. Throughout the years in the United States, we did not promote this, yet a good number of brothers were raised up by the Lord to take the full-time way. However, we need many more full-timers. According to my observation, a number of you who are elders should go full-time. The Lord knows who you are. Just be faithful to His speaking and His leading to go full-time.</p>
<p>When I went to Taiwan in October of 1984, there were very few full-timers. Now in Taipei alone, there are at least one hundred full-time workers. Recently, they went to the city every day not to preach, but to speak the gospel. Also, some individuals from the small group gatherings joined them mostly in the evening. Within three weeks and with the help of the college students who were on vacation, these full-time workers brought in eleven hundred and four people and all of these were baptized.</p>
<p>Without time we can do nothing, and our body is fully in time. Romans 12:1 tells us to present our body. Actually, this means to present our time. If you do not present your time, how could your body be presented? You may say that you will present your body and reserve your time, but your body goes with your time. Thus, there is the need of a good number of saints who are ready, according to God&rsquo;s sight, to go full-time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Living of Full-Time Workers</h2>
<p>There is a great problem concerning full-timers which demands our attention&mdash;the matter of how to make a living by going full-time. The strangest thing concerning this is that from Paul&rsquo;s time up to now this problem has never been solved. The New Testament does not give us any kind of resolution to this problem. Paul was the foremost apostle (1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 12:11). He did the top work and the result and the blessing he enjoyed from his work were all on the top. He was highly regarded and respected by all the churches. Such a one, however, was forced to make tents not only to feed himself but also to feed his co-workers (Acts 18:3; 20:34-35). Surely Paul was much wiser than all of us. Why did he not exercise his wise mind to tell all the churches who were under his ministry to donate a certain portion of their proceeds to him? If he had done this, he might have been rich. He would not have needed to make tents. Those of us who take the full-time way or who are going to take the full-time way have to see something here. Paul never made such a resolution. You may wonder how you can live if you go full-time. My answer is this&mdash;just live. Do not say anything to anyone about your need; just live. If you cannot live, go back to work.</p>
<p>All the denominations have their regulations concerning ways to raise funds to take care of their workers. The China Inland Mission was famous for not having a set system of paying their workers. They trusted in the Lord for their living, but their trusting was corporate not individual. All the offerings would come to the central office of the China Inland Mission&rsquo;s headquarters. These gifts would be distributed to all their missionaries by percentage. Every missionary had to be fearful and trembling. A certain missionary living in the interior of China did not know how much money would come into the central office. If very few offerings came, this missionary may have cause for much concern. Therefore, the China Inland missionaries all prayed to the Lord, trusting Him for their living. All the missionaries of other denominations were different from the China Inland Mission. Their missionaries were promised a certain allowance to take care of the needs of their living.</p>
<p>Our practice in this matter was not exactly the same as that of the China Inland Mission. Brother Nee was the first one among us to take the full-time way. He just lived without any promise from anyone or from any church to support him. He lived by faith and he even told his parents not to take care of him. Those of us who went full-time after him followed his pattern. I must testify that to take this way was really hard. We never made any arrangement for the church to give us a certain monthly allowance. I began to be full-time in 1933. It was not until 1946, by the time I had gone to Shanghai, that the church in Shanghai gave the full-time workers a certain amount of cash every month. Before 1946 I never received any regular supply from any church, even from the church in Chefoo, which I was directly taking care of. Within the five years I stayed in Chefoo, I cannot remember ever having received some material supply from the church. You may wonder how I lived in those years. I just lived. Sometimes I lived by poverty. Sometimes I lived by my family&rsquo;s suffering. But I never made a demand on the church. I did not tell the church that since I was serving there full-time I needed a living. As full-time workers, if we are short of something, we only tell God and tell our poverty. This is why we have surely seen and experienced some miracles regarding the Lord taking care of our living.</p>
<p>I was once assigned by Brother Nee, the leading one in the work, to move my family from Chefoo to a big city in north China, a port city close to the old capital of Peking. The cost of living there was very expensive. I moved there and no church gave me any support. The assigning work did not say anything about my supply. That was our practice. The work, the ministry, only assigned you work to do. They never cared for your need. That was our way.</p>
<p>I moved there firstly by myself, and when I looked at the situation in that big city, I realized that in order to travel and visit others I needed a bicycle. I had only a little over forty dollars in my pocket, which I kept to move my family which included my wife and three children. I needed a bicycle badly, so I prayed to the Lord. I still remember where I kneeled down to ask the Lord to meet my need. In that prayer I was so clear that the Lord was telling me from within to go to buy a bicycle although I only had a little over forty dollars, which was just enough to bring my wife and three children to be with me. Later, a certain brother went with me to visit another brother. After visiting that brother, we two brothers went to a food market. When we came out of the market, we saw a new bicycle standing there. I told the brother with me that this was the kind of bicycle I wanted to buy. Immediately, the owner came out, and I asked him where I could buy such a bicycle and how much it would cost. Then he told me the place and the price. We brothers went to that store and there was such a bicycle for sale there, already assembled. The salesman told me the price was thirty-two dollars, including tax and license. I paid him the thirty-two dollars and took the bike home.</p>
<p>After coming back home, I was happy that I had a bicycle which would be so useful to me in that big city. I went upstairs to the very place where I initially knelt down to pray and gave thanks to the Lord. While I was giving thanks to the Lord, He asked me to count how much money I had received since He told me to buy the bicycle up until the time I paid the thirty-two dollars for it. My prayer for the bicycle was on a Saturday when a certain brother came to see me. We had a long talk and when he left he told me he had a letter for me. Actually, it was not a letter but an envelope, within which was ten dollars. On the next day, the Lord&rsquo;s day, I received a two-dollar gift from the offering box. The very next morning, Monday morning, I received some registered mail from another city. This mail contained a postal money order for twenty dollars. I and the other brother with me went to the post office that same day to cash that money order. It was on that Monday that we also saw the bicycle I purchased, and I had not counted the money I had received from the Lord as gifts. When I added the amounts of ten dollars, two dollars, and twenty dollars, and realized that the Lord had supplied me with thirty-two dollars, the exact amount of the bicycle, I wept before the Lord. How faithful He was! This is one example among the many ways the Lord took care of my practical needs. The Lord sovereignly arranged for me to see that bicycle and supplied me with the exact amount for it. The Lord is truly marvelous! This was one of my experiences concerning trusting in the Lord for my living.</p>
<p>My family and I lived in that large city for one year up until the end of 1936. At the end of the year, I received a cable from Brother Nee asking me to come join him for a co-workers&rsquo; conference. I went to this conference and afterwards I visited quite a number of cities. I traveled during January and February, not being able to return home until some time in March. I left my home and my family without much money. By that time I had four children. One day when I was gone, my wife realized that the next day they would have nothing to live on. My wife was not the kind of person who contacted people frequently, so she had no person to pray with. She only asked our oldest child, who at that time was about seven, and his sister who was five to pray with her. They knelt down by the bed and prayed, &ldquo;Lord, we are in this situation and you know we do not know what to live on tomorrow.&rdquo; It was winter at that time. That evening it was snowing heavily. About ten o&rsquo;clock at night an old sister came in a car to our residence and knocked on the door. She came in and told my wife that something was bothering her, telling her to come and see my wife. Then she said, &ldquo;The Lord told me to come with this,&rdquo; and she gave my wife a large sum of money to take care of her and our children. This older sister had never had any contact with me. She only came to the church meetings. Neither had she had any talk with my wife before that time, and she had never come to visit us in our house. But late in the night, under heavy snowing, she came urgently. Was this not a miracle? That was the way we passed through to be full-time for the Lord.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we who take the way of full-time have no right to ask the church to give us anything. Whether the church would give or would not give us something is up to the church. We have no right to ask or, needless to say, to require or demand others to supply our need. We have only one right&mdash;to trust in the Lord in suffering poverty.</p>
<p>I was sick for two and a half years with tuberculosis during the time that the Japanese army invaded China. China was in a hard situation in that year of 1943. The war had been going on for over six years already and the economic situation of China was really poor. I was very sick and I needed a lot of good care. My wife and my children were in a hard time. She and the children began to eat the kind of food which at that time was only good for feeding the pigs. The poorest people in north China sometimes ate this kind of food. My family was also forced at times by being short of supply to eat that kind of pig food. And in north China we needed coal to burn in the stoves for cooking. My wife went to the seashore like the poor people to pick up things that were carried to the shore by the tide. The waves carried a lot of things which would be good for fuel. When my sister got to know that, she advised my wife not to do this since only the poor people did this. But this was what we suffered in order to serve the Lord with our full-time. We only have the right to tell the Lord our need, and we only have the right to tell our poverty.</p>
<p>When I was sent to Taiwan from Shanghai, the church in Shanghai did not give me one dollar. Brother Nee personally gave me about three hundred dollars, and that was all the money I had when I went to Taiwan. When I went to Taiwan, I took my wife, eight children, and two maids. The older maid had served my family for three generations. She was a widow and it was hard for us to leave her. The second maid, a younger sister, served my family in Nanking for some years. She was a divorced young lady. When we were leaving Shanghai, she cried. We were the ones who brought her to the Lord. My wife and I decided that as long as we could go to Taiwan we should also bring her. We brought these two maids with us, not for help, but out of love. Therefore, we had twelve people living together in one place. The three hundred dollars I had was only good for us to live on for three months. This was all I had to go to Taiwan to begin the work there. I never told any co-worker what I needed. I never told any church what I needed. You all would suppose that I should have been the second one, next to Brother Nee, among the saints who was highly regarded in the recovery, yet this was my financial condition.</p>
<p>If you demand, require, or even ask others to supply your need, this is absolutely a shame. This is not only wrong; this is a shame. If you cannot go this way of being full-time, go back to work. On the one hand, I encourage so many of you to go full-time; but on the other hand, I would advise you that if you go this way, you only have the right to tell your need to the Lord and your poverty. Please go back to do a regular job if you cannot take this way. Whoever goes full-time should be clear that we have no right to ask anyone to supply us. I came to this country and worked so hard for the church in Los Angeles in 1964. For that whole year, the church in Los Angeles probably only gave me no more than eight hundred dollars. I know this because in 1965 I asked a brother to take care of my income tax. He told me that for the whole year of 1964 the church in Los Angeles had not given me over eight hundred dollars.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this way should be carried out by the full-timers. But on the other hand, all the churches, with all the saints, should be faithful in giving. These are two sides. The churches with all the saints should be careful, should be diligent, and should be faithful in giving to take care of the need. Paul says that all the people working for the gospel have the right to live of the gospel (1 Cor. 9:14), but not according to the traditional way. We are here for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even though we do not practice having everything in common, we do practice our faithfulness for His unique purpose on this earth.</p>
<p>I believe the elders should teach the saints concerning these kinds of things quite often to bring them to a full knowledge of the Lord&rsquo;s move. I told the saints in the church in Taipei that out of twenty saints there should be one full-timer. If your church has one hundred, you should have at least five full-timers, but not officially or legally. The one who becomes full-time has no right to ask any of the nineteen to take care of him. Once I discovered something like this, I would advise that brother to go back to his job. It is a shame to tell the supporting ones how much you need. This is begging. We take the way of living by faith. You go this way of being full-time because you believe the One whom you serve is the living One. You do not trust any human being. On the other hand, all the saints should be faithful to give, and the entire church should endeavor to take care of the need of the full-timers. I encourage many of you to be full-time, but once you do you have no right to ask any church to support you. That is a real shame. On the other hand, every church with every saint must be faithful to make more money for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. We believe the Lord is living and He is real. Someday we will stand before His judgment seat and He will judge us (2 Cor. 5:10). Let us live such a life which is termed the kingdom life. We should really mean business with the Lord.</p>
<p>If the church feels it does not want to take care of a certain brother because he is not faithful, it does not need to. Neither does that brother need to go full-time. He should go back to do a job. He should not take a way that forces others to talk about him in a negative way. This is too poor and it is a shame before man and even before the angels and demons.</p>
<p>We should be glorious; we should be dignified. I would never beg. To beg is a shame. For over fifty-three years I never begged. Rather, I spent my money splendidly. When I gave, I gave splendidly. People wondered where I received the money; the Lord has always supplied me. I suffered poverty and my entire family suffered poverty to the uttermost because of His sake. Today we are happy about it. This is our way. On the other hand, we must remember that the saints and the churches should be faithful to the uttermost in giving to Him for His up-to-date move.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
