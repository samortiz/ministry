   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BATHING AND FOOT-WASHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although we Christians are bathed once only, the Bible shows us that foot-washing happens many times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is only one bathing, but there are many foot-washings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is like the cleansing: There is only one cleansing by the blood, but there are many cleansings by the water of the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The accomplished redemption of Christ occurred once only.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But there are many applications by the Holy Spirit of this accomplished work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are bathed only once, and all our sins are washed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But it takes many foot-washings to wash away all the dirt that we pick up on the wilderness journey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There needs to be only one bathing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But foot-washing is a daily work before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Foot-washing is a washing that comes about by the Word of God, through the work of the Holy Spirit, and based upon the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have been cleansed once by His blood, we must continue to be washed daily by His blood as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus does not have to come and do another work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are cleansed again and again based on that one work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not the ashes that are cleansing us but the water of the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ashes of the red heifer are the mark of our judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God did not substitute our judgment with the judgment of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, He judged us in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today man thinks that the Lord Jesus died in place of man; but actually, we died in and with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, we are judged in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This alone will cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My daily cleansing is based on the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know that we have taken a bath, that is, our sins have been cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once we are saved, we are eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What then should we do when we touch the dirt while living on earth and coming into contact with the world every day?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all cannot be like the thief on the cross, who went straight to Paradise without his feet ever touching the earth after he was cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Most people are not saved while on their deathbeds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most still have to take the wilderness journey.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every one of us knows that while we take the wilderness journey, we should not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But sinning is a fact with all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, our feet get dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times we are rash and speak words that we should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times we have improper thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, we admit that we are defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God has prepared the foot-washing of the Lord Jesus for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not just a sign of His love for us, but a sign of His love to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He loved us; hence, He was crucified for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now He loves us to the uttermost; hence, He washes our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Figuratively speaking, foot-washing is not the love before marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Foot-washing is the love after marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He causes us to be continually clean before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why the Lord said that he who has been bathed will be wholly clean once his feet are washed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We thank the Lord that His Son has given us a bath already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord allowed Peter's foolishness to be manifested as a lesson for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He came to Peter, Peter said, "Are You going to wash my feet?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Peter thought that this was a matter of politeness and courtesy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said that Peter would not understand what He did then but would understand later.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is much spiritual truth here.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Holy Spirit comes, we will see.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we are bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All we see is a basin of water and the Lord's washing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not see what they mean.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the future, however, we will understand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But Peter always had his opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He exclaimed that the Lord would never wash his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord told him that the foot-washing was very important.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Lord did not wash Peter's feet that night, Peter would have no part with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not think that it is enough to have a bath once and be cleansed by the blood of the Lord once.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not think that we can get by loosely when we are defiled by the dirt on our way through the world.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord said that if our feet are not washed, we will have no part with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means His fellowship with us today will be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His fellowship with us in the future kingdom will also be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How important are the daily cleansings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must allow the Lord to wash our feet every day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to come back every day to be recovered and to get the application of the power of Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not need the blood of the Lord Jesus to wash us again before God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord's work before God has been finished once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But we can experience the washing many times.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The blood of His Son washes our sins again and again continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, we must have our feet washed every day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have to take care of the cleanliness of our feet every day.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Peter was like we are.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He always went to extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He went to one end at one time and then to the other end at another time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At one moment he said that the Lord would never wash his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then when he heard the Lord say that he would have no part with Him if there were no foot-washing, he asked that his head and his hands be washed as well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord Jesus showed him that this other extreme is wrong also.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord said that he who is bathed has no need except to wash his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No one can repent and believe in the Lord twice.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No one can be regenerated twice.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>No one can receive the Savior twice.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once you come to the Lord Jesus and accept Him as Savior, that is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Perhaps you doubt for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Perhaps you think that when you accepted Him as Savior the last time, you did not do a good enough job, and perhaps you begin to doubt after a few days; you want to accept Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But the Lord said that there is no need.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The head does not need to be washed again, and the hands do not need to be washed again.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord Jesus said that those who have taken a bath only need to have their feet washed in order to be wholly clean.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We only need one bath for the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Although we touch the world and dirty our feet often, this does not affect the cleanliness of our whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There needs to be only one bath for the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The bath cannot be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Even if you walk in the mud and your feet become black, it will not affect the cleanliness of your whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Your body does not need to be cleansed again.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Once you have received the Lord Jesus as the Savior, your body is cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>From then on, you do not need to wash your body again.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>When a man is cleansed once, he is cleansed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>No one can deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>One's feet can get dirty, and he can be cut off from the fellowship of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He can have no share in the kingdom, but the whole body is still clean.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>All those who are bathed need to wash only their feet, and they will be fully clean.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>What we are doing day by day is looking back at our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The Lord Jesus has done an eternal work.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Day by day as we live on earth, we need to keep only our feet clean and free from dirt.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we pick up some dirt by accident, we can still receive a daily washing, so that we can enjoy uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord and reign with Him tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>May the Lord keep our feet clean day after day, so that we can glorify His name here on earth.</S>
