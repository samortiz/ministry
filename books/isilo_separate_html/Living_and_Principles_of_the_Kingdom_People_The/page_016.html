<p>Verses 38 through 41 concern vengeance. The Old Testament law permitted vengeance: &ldquo;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth&rdquo; (v. 38; Exo. 21:24). However, the kingdom of the heavens forbids vengeance. Not only should we not avenge ourselves; we should be prepared to endure others&rsquo; unjust treatment of us. According to the demand of the kingdom of the heavens, when we are slapped on our right cheek, we should turn our other cheek. Furthermore, if someone wishes to take our tunic, we should yield to him our cloak also, and we should go two miles with whoever compels us to go one mile (Matt. 5:39-41).</p>
<p>These demands are also related to the flesh. If someone can be slapped on his right cheek and would turn his other cheek, his flesh has been dealt with. Someone who tolerates his right cheek being slapped may still be in the flesh, but only those who can turn the other cheek have dealt with the flesh. Vengeance is an issue of the flesh. People contend over money, or they contend to be vindicated. The kingdom of the heavens demands that we deal with the flesh; thus, it does not permit vengeance. Moreover, the kingdom of the heavens demands that we endure more and give more.</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament law, if someone asks to borrow money from us, we do not need to consent. Furthermore, if we lend someone money, we can demand that he repay it immediately (cf. Lev. 25:37). However, the demand of the kingdom of the heavens is that we must not turn away someone who wants to borrow from us. Furthermore, when we lend him money, we should expect nothing in return (Matt. 5:42; Luke 6:35). This demand requires us to be free from the usurpation of material possessions. The kingdom of the heavens demands that we deal with the flesh and the usurpation of material possessions. If we would be such people, the Lord will have sufficient ground in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING LOVING OTHERS</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:43 through 48 speaks of loving others. The Old Testament law says, &ldquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy&rdquo; (v. 43). But the kingdom of the heavens demands that we love our enemies (v. 44). This is also related to the flesh. If we love those who love us but hate those who do not love us, we are still living in the flesh. As Christians, we know that hatred is a matter of the flesh, but our love can have even more of the element of the flesh.</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens demands that we have the same love toward everyone. This is to demand that we put to death our flesh. The Lord said, &ldquo;If you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what better thing are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?&rdquo; (vv. 46-47). If we love only those whom we like, we are no different from people in the world. Such love is natural; it is the love of the Gentiles. Such love proves that a person still lives in the natural man.</p>
<p>The Lord wants us to love our enemies so that we can be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect (v. 48). Our Father has the same love for both the good and the evil; there is no distinction (v. 45). Therefore, we must love others in the same way. The words <em>heavenly Father</em> imply life and authority. If we let the heavens rule, live in God, and let His life live in us, we will be the same as our heavenly Father; we will be delivered from our natural love, and we will deal with our temper and flesh in the matter of loving others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The above points are the demands of the kingdom of the heavens. They are also the living of a person who is under the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens. The demand of the kingdom of the heavens is that we deal with our temper, the flesh, the self, and the usurpation of material possessions. On the one hand, we are living under the ruling of the heavens. On the other hand, we are living by the Father&rsquo;s life and giving Him all the ground in us. This is the demand of the kingdom of the heavens. This demand is higher, fuller, and more perfect than the demand of the Old Testament law. Our Savior wants to save us to such a glorious and complete living.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
