   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION TWENTY-FOUR CONCERNING AN OLD TESTAMENT MIRACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the most crucial miracle in the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To what does this miracle refer?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Old Testament, the most crucial miracle is the miracle of Jonah, which refers to the Lord Jesus' resurrection from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some have misinterpreted this miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They say that the miracle of Jonah being in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights typifies the Lord being in the earth for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, being dead and buried in the earth for three days and three nights is not a miracle because it is very common to be buried in the earth after death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also quite possible for a person to jump into the sea and be devoured by a big fish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not a miracle to be in the belly of a big fish for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not even a miracle to be in the belly of a big fish for fifty days and fifty nights.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But being in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights and then coming out of it is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For Christ to be in the grave for three days and three nights is not a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His resurrection from the grave after three days and three nights is the miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Death is not a miracle, but resurrection is a miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jonah had made up his mind and would not have returned if he had not suffered a calamity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was very racially prejudiced.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God commanded him to go to Nineveh, but he went his own way to Tarshish.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although he did not obey God, God did not let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He sent a great wind into the sea, and Jonah's ship was on the verge of being destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, Jonah realized that he was the cause of the calamity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Finally, he asked the people on the ship to cast him into the sea, and the storm subsided.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah, and he remained in the belly of this fish three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When God commanded the fish to vomit Jonah out upon the dry land, Jonah obeyed God's command to go to Nineveh and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, if you want to have peace within, you have to cast this man, Jonah, into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jonah was a man who rebelled and escaped the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was cast into the sea because of his own sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our Lord, however, was crucified on the cross on behalf of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Jonah was cast into the sea, everything became peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Lord died, everything was also at peace man was reconciled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we are willing to accept the position the Lord gives to us, everything will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jonah had to be cast into the sea, the Lord Jesus had to die, and we too must die and partake of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Burial is typified by Jonah being cast into the sea and swallowed in the belly of the big fish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The unique meaning of burial is keeping the dead out of our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After Abraham's wife Sarah died, he spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, "Give me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight" Gen 23:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our baptism is to confess that the Lord Jesus' death is real and that our death with Him is also real.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have both died and been buried together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Resurrection is typified by the fish vomiting out Jonah upon the dry land.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus has been raised from the grave, and we have been raised together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus' resurrection is the central point of this miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Resurrection is not only an objective fact but also a subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before Jonah was cast into the sea, he would rather have died than go to Nineveh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jonah was not ready to go to Nineveh until the big fish vomited him out upon the dry land.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This fundamental change in him was the work of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After we believe in the Lord and have the experience of resurrection, we are willing to do what we previously were very unwilling to do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We previously failed constantly in many things and were unable to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But once we received the resurrection life, we underwent a fundamental change.</S>
