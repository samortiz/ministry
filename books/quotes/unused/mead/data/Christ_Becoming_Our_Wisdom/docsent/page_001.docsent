   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR WISDOM Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:30</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible speaks of Christ as our life in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the meaning of the words "Christ is our life" is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 1:30 explains what Christ as our life means.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This passage can be divided into two sections.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first section says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This speaks of our relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second section says, "Who became wisdom to us from God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This speaks of Christ's relationship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Putting it another way, this verse speaks of how we are in Christ and also how Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must pay attention to these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some Christians emphasize only the first of these two aspects, while others emphasize only the second aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether one emphasizes the first aspect or the second, any bias will result in problems and sickness to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must have a proper knowledge of both aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must know how we can be in Christ and how Christ can be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has given us the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His purpose is not for Him to be our teacher or a pattern that we follow, but for us to take Him as our life, so that His life can be manifested through us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not have the life of Christ, we cannot be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have the life of Christ but do not know how this life has become our life, we cannot be a proper Christian and readily manifest His life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How then can we have Christ as our life?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a very basic question.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus is God, and He is also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we have Him as our life?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This seems to be impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can never solve this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only God can solve this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is able to do what man cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us that this work has been accomplished by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God had not done this work, it would have been impossible for Christ to become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first part of this verse says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first part of the work was done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second part says, "Who became wisdom to us from God."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The second part of the work was also done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We cannot make the Lord Jesus our wisdom; He "became wisdom to us from God."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, Christ as our life is something that God Himself has done.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether it is the first or the second part, nothing is possible apart from God, and nothing will be accomplished apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has made Christ our life.</S>
