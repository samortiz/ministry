Regeneration is the center of the experience of salvation, because God's central purpose in saving us is that we may have His life
Whenever a person repents, confessing that he is a sinner who is good for nothing except burial, he is accepting John's ministry
The center of the ministry of the Lord Jesus is the Spirit, that is, to germinate people with a new life in the new creation
All our experiences of spiritual life are matters of the new man who begins within us at the time of our regeneration
We are on the one hand the old, fallen man in Adam, and we are on the other hand the new, regenerated man in Christ
We do not need religious or ethical teachings to regulate and correct us; we need another life, the life of God, to regenerate us
God's purpose is that we may obtain His own uncreated life and be transformed by this life into His image to be like Him
Even if our human life had not been corrupted by the fall of man in Genesis 3, we would still need to be regenerated
God's purpose in creating man is not merely to obtain a sinless man, but even more to have a God-man, one who has God's own life and nature
In His conversation with Nicodemus, the Lord revealed that regardless of how good we are, we still need regeneration
Some Christians hold the mistaken concept that people need regeneration simply because they are sinful and fallen
If man had never fallen into sin, he still would have needed regeneration because he was lacking the life of God
Regardless of the kind of human life we have, as long as we do not have the divine life, we need to be regenerated
Due to the influence of human culture and the Jewish religion, Nicodemus thought that men needed to behave properly
He supposed that in order for men to have good conduct and worship God in a proper way, they need much teaching
To be born again is to be regenerated with the divine life-a life other than the human life received by natural birth
We do not need religion or teachings to regulate and correct us; we need another life-the life of God-to regenerate us
When Nicodemus heard that he had to be born again, he thought it meant that he had to return to his mother's womb and come out again
He was saying to Nicodemus that even if he could go back into his mother's womb and be born a second time, he would still be the same
If He had used the sinful woman in John 4 as the example, we might conclude that only sinful people need to be born again
It is also a guarantee that one day, through the transformation of our soul and the glorification of our body, we shall enjoy full sonship
By regeneration we not only obtain God's life with its divine elements, but we are also united with God as one
What a marvelous and deep relationship is this-that in at least one part of our being-our spirit-we are fully one with God!
When the Lord Jesus entered into death death used all its power to hold Him but the Lord broke through the holding power of death and arose
With every kind of life, whether it is vegetable, animal, human, or divine, there is an automatic and innate function
There is an inward law which does not allow the peach tree to produce apples and which causes it spontaneously to bear peaches
Before we were regenerated, our heart was inclined toward sin and the world, but it was cold and hard toward God and spiritual things
On one hand He used the blood of the Lord Jesus to cleanse away the defilement of our spirit so that our spirit became clean
On the other hand by His Spirit He put His life into our spirit so that our spirit could have His divine element
Since at the time of our regeneration God had already given us a new heart, why does He proceed further to put a new spirit in us?
When God regenerated us, He put His life into our spirit, enlivening our dead spirit, and He also put His Spirit into our spirit
Romans 8:9 says, 'The Spirit of God dwells in you,' and verse 16 says, 'The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit'
Since Christ is the embodiment of God, and since regeneration causes us to receive Christ, it also causes us to have God
We obtain the life of God and the law of this life, a new heart and a new spirit, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God Himself
These are sufficient to make us victorious and transcendent above our problems and to cause us to grow and mature in life
Just as this is a fixed principle in physical life, it is even more solid and substantial in the spiritual realm
The salvation of God is not primarily to save us from hell and to bring us into heaven, but rather to impart His divine life into us
From our spirit, He is spreading into our soul by the process of transformation, and at His second coming, He will even saturate our body
