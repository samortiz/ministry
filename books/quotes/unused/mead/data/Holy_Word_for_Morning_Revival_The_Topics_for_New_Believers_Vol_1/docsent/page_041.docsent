   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 6 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 2:46 And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Heb 10:24-25 And let us consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together but exhorting one another</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's Ordained Way for Christian Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's ordained way for Christian meetings is 165 first to meet from house to house Acts 2:46; 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 2:46 tells us that the believers broke bread "from house to house," and 5:42 says that "from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Greek indicates that they met according to houses, which means that every house had a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>166 Thus, the New Testament indicates that each one of us should have a meeting in our home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, these home meetings should not be just with our own family; they should also include others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second , the New Testament also shows us that in addition to having the group meetings in the homes, the entire church should also come together in one place 1 Cor 14:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>167 In the beginning of the church life in Acts the larger gatherings were needed, but the larger gatherings were not a daily need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The daily need was the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>168 Thus, the church should have regular separate home meetings and should gather together in one place as the need arises.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>169 However, we need to see that the group meetings are more basic.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>170 The big meetings can attract the people, but only the small meetings can build people up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The small meetings are the foundation of the building of the church; this is an unshakable law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we do not keep this law, we will not have any building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>171 Hence , the group meetings are the "lifeline," the "pulse," of our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>172</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The group meeting is eighty percent of the church life, and the church life is a life in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our physical body, it is impossible for a problem in one member to be hidden from all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The circulation of life in our body carries the feeling in one member to all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, we should not hide our problems from the other members in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>173 In saying this, I do not mean that we should open everything to others without restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we do need to learn to open our ordinary, daily matters to our fellow believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without the proper opening of ourselves to one another, it is difficult to practice the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>174</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among all the meetings in the church life, no other meeting is as intimate, as practical, and as all-inclusive as the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It includes fellowship, interceding, mutual care, and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>175 Furthermore, if we do not have these things, it is difficult to have the mutual teaching through asking and answering questions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>176 For the perfecting of the saints, there is the need of teaching in the group meetings, and in the group meetings all are teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>177 Everyone is both a teacher and a learner.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>178</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The scriptural basis for the group meetings is in Hebrews 10:24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>179 In these verses there are three crucial words: consider, incite, and exhort ing .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To consider one another implies to remember, to have a sincere, loving concern for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It implies that the saints are in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>180 Verse 24 goes on to say we must also incite them, stir them up.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They might become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If so, we have to fan the fire for them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>181 Good works here refers to giving something to others freely or doing something freely for others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To give a financial gift or to care for a sick brother is a good work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is the need for many such good works in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to incite one another to love and to this kind of good work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 25 also says that we are to exhort one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>182 You exhort me and I exhort you; you learn and I also learn.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to this portion of the Word, we must consider , incite, and exhort one another mutually.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>183</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
