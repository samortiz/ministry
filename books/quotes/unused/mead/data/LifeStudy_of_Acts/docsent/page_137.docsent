   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSTITUTED OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul was not constituted of the Spirit of God nor of the Spirit of Jehovah but of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a vessel containing the Triune God, Paul was fully constituted of the Holy Spirit, who was involved with the Lord s incarnation and birth, and of the Spirit of Jesus, who was involved with the Lord s humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, life-imparting resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul was a person constituted of this all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, when he came out to preach, he could truly preach Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the Spirit by whom we are guided and of whom we are constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, this Spirit should become our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then our work will be the expression of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, do you think it would have been possible for Elijah to be led by the Holy Spirit or for him to do a work for Jesus as the incarnated One with humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No, Elijah did not have this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had only the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Elijah may have had a powerful Spirit, but he was not constituted of the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, he could never do the work of ministering Jesus as the all-inclusive One or convey Him as such a One to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>SEEING THE SIGNIFICANCE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In reading Acts 16 it is easy to consider the matter of the leading of the Spirit in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As we have seen, Paul did not carry out his work for the spread of the gospel according to his decision, preference, and schedule but by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This understanding is also general.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need the heavenly vision to see what is implied by the two divine titles the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to understand these titles we need to dig into the depths of the Bible concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to study the Spirit throughout the Scriptures, considering the Spirit of God in Genesis and the Spirit of Jehovah elsewhere in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we need to see why the term the Holy Spirit is not used until it was time for God to become incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we see this, we shall realize that the title the Holy Spirit is involved with God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In particular, this title indicates God s coming into man to be one with man in incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the New Testament the title the Holy Spirit indicates that God is now mingling Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We also need the insight to see the significance of the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This title of the Spirit refers to the Lord as the all-inclusive One who was a man, who lived a human life in His humanity, who went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death, who was resurrected for the propagation of the divine life, and who ascended into the heavens to be made Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we dig into the Scriptures and have the heavenly vision concerning the Spirit, we shall see that the Spirit of Jesus implies the Lord s humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is very easy to acquire a superficial understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even by reading the Bible through once you can gain some superficial knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But to see the heavenly revelation requires that we dig into the depths of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We also need insight to see what is revealed in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus had such a deep understanding of the Scriptures when He pointed out that the title the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob implies resurrection Matt 22:31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>May we all learn to dig into the depths of God s Word to know the deeper truths that have been buried for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In particular, may we all learn the meaning of the two divine titles found in Acts 16:6 and 7 the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
