   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Giving His Life a Ransom for Many</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His death the Lord Jesus worked to give His life a ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and to give His life a ransom for many" Matt 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His humanity the Lord served sinners even with His life, that is, with His soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 10:11 the Lord says in a clear but general way that He would lay down His life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in Matthew 20:28 He says definitely that He gives His life a ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord's soulish life was the ransom, the price, He paid for many.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus gave His soul a ransom for many when He died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During the last three hours the Lord Jesus was on the cross, God put our sins upon Him, regarding Him as the unique sinner, even as sin itself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, God forsook Christ economically, leaving Him alone under His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, Christ's giving His human life as a ransom for us took place under the process of God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While He was being judged by God for us, He gave His soul life as a ransom, as a payment, for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This payment required a procedure that lasted at least three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a great matter that on the cross the Lord Jesus paid the price for us, giving His soul life as a ransom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because God is a God of law, He must do everything legally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even in forgiving us, in writing off our debt, He must act legally.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, God's enemy Satan is always watchful to see if God will act righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God were to do anything in an unrighteous way, Satan would immediately protest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, with respect to Christ's giving Himself as a ransom for many in payment of our debt, God could not do anything lawlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, He had to do everything according to His nature and His way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ paid the price for us by doing a great work according to God's nature, justice, and requirements and under the watching of the enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, God forsook Christ economically.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, God was waiting and watching to see how Christ as our Substitute would pay the debt for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the reason that the time of God's judgment of Christ as our Substitute lasted three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For Christ to pay off our debt it was necessary for Him to pass through a process that went on for three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From this we see that Christ did a great work in giving Himself as a ransom to pay off our debt before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Offering Himself as a Sacrifice for Sins</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His death Christ offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hebrews 10:12 says, "This One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The priests in the old covenant stood daily v. 11 and offered the same sacrifices again and again, because what they offered could not take away sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their standing was a sign that the taking away of sins had not been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was Christ's offering of Himself that has accomplished the taking away of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whereas the old covenant priests stood daily offering the same sacrifices again and again, Christ has put away sin by offering Himself to God as the unique sacrifice for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His sitting in heaven is a sign and proof that the taking away of sins has been accomplished Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He no longer needs to do anything for sin, for He has done it once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews 9:26 says, "Now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here the consummation of the ages means the end of the Old Testament age, whereas the consummation of the age in Matthew 28:20 indicates the close of the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ was foreordained for us before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:20 , and He was slain from the foundation of the world Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Actually, His being slain took place once for all at the consummation of the ages, when He offered Himself to God for the putting away of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>More than nineteen centuries ago, Christ put away sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before He accomplished this, the priests offered the sin offering day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But that was not the actual putting away of sin; it was only a type, a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The real putting away of sin was accomplished once for all by Christ on the cross when He offered Himself as a sacrifice for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hebrews 9:14 tells us that Christ offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the cross Christ offered Himself to God in a human body Heb 10:5, 10 , which body is a matter of time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But He did this through the eternal Spirit, who is of eternity, without any limit of time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His offering of Himself was once for all Heb 7:27 , and the redemption accomplished through His death is eternal Heb 9:12 , having an eternal effect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ's offering Himself as a sacrifice for sin involves His being the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During the last three hours He was on the cross, He was in the sight of God the unique sinner offering Himself as a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This work was accomplished once for all, and it is eternally effective.</S>
