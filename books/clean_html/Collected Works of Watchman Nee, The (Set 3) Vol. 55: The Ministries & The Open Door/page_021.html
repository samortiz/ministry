<h2 class="head4">Attitude toward the Gospel</h2><p>We should lead the young believers to be zealous for the gospel and to have a proper attitude toward it. They must be on fire for the gospel. The gospel must be a consuming obsession to them. They must forget their positions and their faces. They should not care if others laugh at them or oppose them. They must open their mouths to preach the gospel and kneel and pray in any place at any time. Every time they go out of their house, they need to pass out some gospel tracts. In their spare time they must look for people to preach the gospel to. They must commit themselves to preaching the gospel to a certain number of people every day. They must also commit themselves to saving one soul within a set period of time. This seems artificial, even giving the appearance of an activity of the flesh, but the young believers need this kind of exercise.</p><p>We must lead the young believers to pay equal attention to these matters. The knowledge of life causes them to grow in life, the knowledge of the Bible causes them to be edified in knowledge, and their attitude toward the gospel causes them to be exercised in the work. These three matters are all interrelated, and they build one upon each other.</p><h2 class="head3">Migration for Christians</h2><p>After the brothers and sisters in a local church have received a certain amount of edification, the church should encourage them to receive the Lord's leading to migrate to other localities and far away places for the sake of the gospel.</p><p>When the gospel went out from Jerusalem in the beginning, there were two lines. The first line consisted of the believers scattering abroad and preaching the gospel. The second line consisted of apostles doing the same thing. The gospel preaching in the first half of Acts (before chapter thirteen) was done almost entirely along the first line, while the gospel preaching in the second half of Acts (beginning in chapter thirteen) was done almost entirely along the second line. In God's eyes the believers' preaching is as significant as that of the apostles' preaching. God's desire is to have His gospel preached to the entire creation through these two lines. Unfortunately, today nearly all of the preaching of the gospel is along the line of the apostles; almost no one preaches along the line of the believers. Consequently, the gospel cannot go out as fast as in the beginning. For the sake of the spread of the gospel in these last days, we should allow God to recover the line of the believers' preaching.</p><p>According to the Bible, Christians should be moving, not standing. We are the true descendants of Abraham (Gal. 3:7). We should be pilgrims on the earth, moving and pitching our tents as he did (Heb. 11:9, 13; 1 Pet. 2:11). We should walk on the earth but not "dwell on the earth." We have a "commonwealth...in the heavens" (Phil. 3:20). On earth we should "wander without a home" (1 Cor. 4:11). If we have an established dwelling place on earth and cannot migrate, we are not up to the Christian standard; we have a problem. We are rooted on the earth. We must be like nomads and always be moving. When we move, the gospel moves with us. We carry the germs of the gospel with us. Wherever we go, the gospel spreads like a contagion. The gospel should spread to all lands this way.</p><p>The gospel came to China from the West one hundred years ago. However, up to the present time, the footsteps of the gospel have only reached the coastal provinces. The interior of China and the remote areas have seen little of the gospel. The gospel has been preached so slowly in China because of two main reasons:</p><p>1)The Chinese Christians have been immature in the growth in life. The gospel does not spread through excitement, ideas, or even organization. The gospel spreads through planting Christ's life into men like a seed. Suppose a kind of botanical seed is brought to China from a foreign country and planted in the coastal areas of China. We must wait until the seed grows up, matures, and produces other seeds before we can plant these seeds in other regions. This is the way the gospel spreads. Christians in the coastal regions must be very mature in life before they can go out and plant the gospel in remote areas.</p><p>2)In the past almost no Christians from the coastal regions migrated to the remote provinces, so it has been difficult for the gospel to move from the coast to the interior. The preaching of the gospel is like a relay race in a stadium. The brothers from the West brought the gospel to the coastal regions of China and passed it on to us. We brothers in the coastal regions should receive the gospel and carry it to the interior and remote regions. We should not expect the brothers from the West to pass us up and go there before us. If we would migrate with the gospel to all these places, the gospel would spread very quickly over the whole country.</p><p>Although many Christians from the coastal regions have migrated to the interior in the past ten years because of Japan's attack on China, most of them went with the motive of escaping the war, finding a job, finding a school, or finding their families; very few went for the gospel. After the war was over, most returned to the coastal regions. Very few seeds of the gospel remained in the interior. This is a pity.</p><p>Today every locality along the coast should help the brothers and sisters in every occupation prepare themselves for the Lord's leading to take up their occupation, families, and even more, the gospel to migrate to the remote provinces. In this way the gospel will not stop with us.</p>
