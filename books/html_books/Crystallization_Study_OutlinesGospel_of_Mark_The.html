Mark 1:15, 35; 4:23-25; 8:22-26; 6:45-52; 9:7-9; 10:45; 16:7</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart is that the reality in Jesus, the God-man living of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels, would be duplicated in the many members of Christ&rsquo;s Body by the Spirit of reality to become the reality of the Body of Christ, the highest peak in God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Eph. 4:20-24, 3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The reality of the Body of Christ is the corporate living of the perfected God-men, who live the divine life of their new man by denying the natural life of their old man according to the model of Christ as the first God-man&mdash;Mark 8:34; Rom. 6:4-6; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 3:16-17a; 1 Pet. 2:21.</li>
	<li>The reality of the Body of Christ is the Spirit of reality, who is the Spirit of Jesus, mingled with our spirit; the Spirit of Jesus includes the reality in Jesus, the God-man living of Jesus&mdash;John 16:13; Acts 16:7; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>When we live in the mingled spirit, we are learning Christ according to the reality in Jesus by the Spirit of reality according to His model as the Slave-Savior in the Gospel of Mark so that His biography becomes our history; the living of the Body of Christ as the new man should be exactly the same as the living of Jesus revealed in the Gospel of Mark&mdash;Gal. 6:17-18; Rom. 1:1, 9; Eph. 4:20-24; Phil. 2:5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to live in the reality of the Body of Christ by entering into the reality of the Gospel of Mark through the Spirit of reality&mdash;John 16:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The biography of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark is also our biography, our history, with Peter as our representative&mdash;16:7; <em>Hymns,</em> #949, stanza 4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the angel&rsquo;s message to the three sisters who discovered the resurrection of the Slave-Savior, the phrase <em>and Peter</em> is inserted only in Mark&rsquo;s record (v. 7); the Gospel of Mark is considered to be a written account dictated by Peter and written down by his spiritual son, Mark (1 Pet. 5:13).</li>
		<li>Even though Peter had committed the great sin of denying the Lord three times, the Lord specifically mentioned him; this is the gospel&mdash;Mark 14:67-72; Luke 15:1-7; John 21:15-17.</li>
		<li><em>And Peter</em> means &ldquo;and you,&rdquo; who have failed like Peter, revealing that although we fail the Lord, it is impossible for Him to forget us, forsake us, give up on us, or not love us; if we fall, He will not desert us, and He can make us rise up again for His economy&mdash;Rom. 14:4, 7-8; Deut. 31:6; Josh. 1:5; Heb. 13:5; Isa. 49:14-16; Jer. 29:11-14; Prov. 24:16; cf. S. S. 8:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Mark 6:45-52 reveals that we need to seek out the journey, the course, that the Lord has ordained for us according to His perfect will and to enjoy Him as our heavenly Minister and High Priest, the One who is interceding for us and sustaining us to finish our course in living a heavenly life on earth for the reality of the Body of Christ&mdash;Heb. 8:1-2; 7:26; Acts 20:24; 2 Tim. 4:7-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>From the ascension of Christ to His coming again, the world is in a long night; &ldquo;the night is far advanced&rdquo; (Rom. 13:12), our boat is &ldquo;in the midst of the sea,&rdquo; and we still have not reached the destination of our journey&mdash;Mark 6:45-48; John 6:21; cf. 2 Thes. 2:2; 2 Tim. 3:1-13.</li>
		<li>We need to realize that the journey of faithful believers is one that is &ldquo;contrary to the wind,&rdquo; and they experience being &ldquo;distressed&rdquo; as they &ldquo;row&rdquo;; we need to take the Lord into our &ldquo;boat&rdquo; (our married life, our family, our business, etc.) and enjoy peace with Him on the journey of human life&mdash;Mark 6:47-51; John 6:21.</li>
		<li>In these days, just before the dawn of the Lord&rsquo;s coming (2 Pet. 1:19), we need to stand against the wearing-out tactics of Satan (Dan. 7:25), be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus (2 Tim. 2:1), and receive mercy from the Lord to be faithful (1 Cor. 7:25b) to take the journey that He has ordained for the building up of His Body, His bride, to bring Him back (Matt. 16:18; Gen. 2:22; Rev. 19:7).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to enter into the reality of the Gospel of Mark, we need to repent, to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future; to repent is to turn from all things other than God to God Himself&mdash;1:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On the negative side, to repent before God is not only to repent of sins and wrongdoings but also to repent of the world and its corruption, which usurp and corrupt people whom God created for Himself, and to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past&mdash;Isa. 55:7; 2 Pet. 3:9-10, 15.</li>
		<li>On the positive side, it is to turn to God in every way and in everything for the fulfillment of His purpose in creating man; it is a &ldquo;repentance unto God,&rdquo; and is to &ldquo;repent and turn to God&rdquo;&mdash;Acts 20:21; 26:20.</li>
		<li>Repentance unto life, unto God&rsquo;s organic salvation in life, is a gift given to us from the exalted Christ&mdash;5:31; 11:18.</li>
		<li>Christ as the kindness of God leads us to repentance so that, according to His mercy, we can be reconditioned, remade, and remodeled with Him as life&mdash;Rom. 2:4; Titus 3:4-5.</li>
		<li>Repentance is a divine requirement of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and a main item of its proclamation&mdash;Acts 17:30; Luke 24:47.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In order to enter into the reality of the Gospel of Mark, we need to &ldquo;hear Him!&rdquo; and see &ldquo;Jesus only&rdquo;&mdash;9:7-9; cf. Rev. 1:10, 12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to take heed to the way we hear the word of the Lord, asking the Lord to give us an ear to hear what the Spirit is speaking to the churches; the measure that can be given to us by the Lord depends on the measure of our hearing&mdash;Mark 4:23-25; Rev. 2:7.</li>
		<li>We need to have a private and intimate time with the Lord so that He can infuse us with His element to recover our sight; we all need a further recovery so that we can &ldquo;see all things clearly&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 8:22-26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to live in the reality of the Body of Christ according to the bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the reality in Jesus in the Gospel of Mark, which unveils a full picture of the Slave-Savior serving fallen sinners as a collective person with Himself as their all-inclusive salvation; the life of the Lord Jesus as revealed in Mark is the reality, substance, and pattern of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;1:35-38; 10:45:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Gospel of Mark shows the Slave-Savior coming as a Physician with mercy and grace to heal and recover a complete, sick person with four kinds of major diseases; just as God desires to show mercy to pitiful sinners, so He wants us to show mercy in love to others&mdash;2:17; 12:33; Matt. 9:12-13; Micah 6:6-8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A fever may signify a person&rsquo;s unbridled temper, which is abnormal and intemperate; the Slave-Savior heals our sick condition, becoming our inward rest and quietness, and restores us to normality that we might serve Him&mdash;Mark 1:29-31; Isa. 30:15a; cf. Prov. 15:1; 25:15.</li>
		<li>Leprosy is the most contaminating and damaging disease, causing its victim to be isolated from God and from men; the cleansing of the leper signifies the recovering of the sinner to the fellowship with God and with men&mdash;Mark 1:40-45; Num. 12:1-10; 2 Kings 5:1, 9-14; Mark 14:3; 1 John 1:3.</li>
		<li>The paralytic signifies a sinner who is paralyzed by sin, one who is unable to walk and move before God; through the forgiveness of our sins in Christ&rsquo;s judicial redemption, we are able to walk and move by the Spirit in God&rsquo;s organic salvation&mdash;Mark 2:1-12; 1 John 1:7, 9; Gal. 5:25.</li>
		<li>The flow of blood, the issue of blood, signifies a life that cannot be retained; by touching the Lord, His divine power is transfused, through the perfection of His humanity, into us to become our healing; the God who dwells in unapproachable light became touchable in the Slave-Savior through His humanity for our salvation and enjoyment&mdash;Mark 5:25-34.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>After the healing of the entire person, there is the Lord&rsquo;s exposure and cleansing of the real inner being, the heart&mdash;7:1-23.</li>
	<li>In addition to this healing, there are three feedings by the Lord&mdash;the feeding of five thousand (6:30-44), the feeding of the Gentiles as the pet dogs under the table (7:27), and the feeding of four thousand (8:1-9).</li>
	<li>After this collective person is healed, cleansed within, and fed by the Lord, he needs the specific healing of his listening organ, speaking organ, and seeing organ&mdash;7:31-37; 8:14-26.</li>
	<li>Now on the Mount of Transfiguration, his ears are opened to hear the Lord Jesus as the Father&rsquo;s Son, the Beloved, and his eyes are opened to see &ldquo;Jesus only,&rdquo; to see that He is the unique and universal replacement to be the unique constituent of the one new man&mdash;8:27&mdash;9:13; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
	<li>The Lord then brings His followers as a collective person into His all-inclusive death (Mark 15:16-41) and His all-surpassing resurrection (16:1-18) so that they may enjoy Him in His all-transcending ascension (v. 19) as their life and life supply (John 6:35, 57), the Lord of all (Acts 10:36), God&rsquo;s Christ (2:36), the Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22-23a), the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18), the glorified One (Luke 24:26), the enthroned One (Acts 5:31), the One who is above all (Eph. 1:20-21), and the One who fills all in all (v. 23b) to bring forth the new man as the reality of the kingdom of God (Col. 3:10-11; Rom. 14:17), consummating in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2).</li>
	<li>Finally, the Lord as the resurrected and ascended Slave-Savior preaches the gospel through His disciples as His reproduction for His universal spreading, until He comes again to set up the kingdom of God on earth&mdash;Mark 16:20; Luke 19:12; Dan. 7:13-14; Matt. 24:14.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Slave of God</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 10:45;<br />
Phil. 2:5-9; Isa. 42:1-4; 50:4-5, 7; Exo. 21:1-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The subject of the Gospel of Mark is the Slave of God as the Slave-Savior of sinners&mdash;10:45:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Mark&rsquo;s purpose is to provide a detailed record to show the beauty of the Lord Jesus as the Slave of God in His human virtues&mdash;5:34; 6:34; 8:23; 10:14-16.</li>
	<li>In New Testament usage, the word <em>slave</em> refers to one who has sold himself and has lost all human rights&mdash;Rom. 1:1; 2 Pet. 1:1; Jude 1; Rev. 1:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was a slave who had no rights.</li>
		<li>In His gospel service He was a slave not only to God but also to man&mdash;Matt. 20:28; Phil. 2:7; Acts 3:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A key to understanding the Gospel of Mark is that in this Gospel we see much more of the Lord&rsquo;s acts than of His words&mdash;3:10-11; 4:39; cf. Acts 10:36-42.</li>
	<li>Mark&rsquo;s record concerning Christ as the Slave of God is a record of the Lord&rsquo;s excellent deeds, which displayed both His lovely humanity in its virtue and perfection and His deity in its glory and honor&mdash;1:14-15, 21-22, 25-26, 30-31, 38-41; 2:10-11; 7:31-37.</li>
	<li>Mark 10:45 reveals that, as the Slave of God, He served sinners even with His life, His soul; by giving His life as a ransom for sinners, the Lord Jesus accomplished the eternal purpose of God, whom He served as a slave.</li>
	<li>As the Slave of God, the Lord Jesus taught His disciples, at the very time they were striving to be first, to take the position of a slave&mdash;vv. 35-45.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Gospel of Mark are the details of the teaching regarding Christ as the Slave of God in Philippians 2:5-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although the Lord was equal with God, He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped and retained; rather, He laid aside the form of God and emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave&mdash;vv. 6-7.</li>
	<li>In His incarnation the Lord Jesus did not alter His divine nature; He changed only His outward expression, from the form of God, the highest form, to that of a slave, the lowest form&mdash;v. 7.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s work in His human living to build up the fashion of a man and take on the form of a slave was the foundation and background of His ministry&mdash;v. 8a.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus humbled Himself, &ldquo;becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross,&rdquo; which was the climax of His humiliation&mdash;v. 8b.</li>
	<li>The Lord humbled Himself to the uttermost, but God exalted Him to the highest peak&mdash;v. 9.</li>
	<li>The pattern presented in Philippians 2:5-9 is now the life within us; there is an urgent need among us to experience Christ as such a pattern.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;v. 5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is the mind that was in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man&mdash;vv. 5-8.</li>
		<li>To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts, in His tender inward feeling and in His thinking&mdash;1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Gospel of Mark is the fulfillment of the detailed prophecies in Isaiah concerning Christ as the Slave of Jehovah; by considering these prophecies, we can understand more fully what is recorded in Mark concerning Christ as a slave:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus Christ, the Slave of God, was God&rsquo;s choice; God delighted in Him&mdash;Isa. 42:1.</li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s life was a life of sorrows and grief&mdash;53:2-3.</li>
	<li>Instead of crying out and making His voice heard in the street, He was calm and quiet; He did not strive with others or promote Himself&mdash;42:2; Matt. 12:18-21.</li>
	<li>Because He was full of mercy, He would not break those who are like a bruised reed, which cannot give a musical sound, or quench the ones who are like burning flax, which cannot give forth a shining light&mdash;Isa. 42:3-4.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus did not speak His own word, but having the tongue of the instructed, He spoke according to God&rsquo;s instructions&mdash;50:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jehovah awakened Him every morning, awakening His ear to hear as an instructed one&mdash;v. 4b.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus was never rebellious; rather, He was always obedient, listening to the word of God&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>Because the Lord Jesus had the ear and the tongue of an instructed one, He knew how &ldquo;to sustain the weary with a word&rdquo;&mdash;v. 4a.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Slave-Savior trusted in God and set His face like a flint; in fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose, He was strong&mdash;v. 7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The servant in Exodus 21:1-6 is a type of Christ as the Slave of God, who sacrificed Himself to serve God and God&rsquo;s people&mdash;Matt. 20:28; Eph. 5:2, 25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the Slave of God, the Lord Jesus stood in the position of doing nothing on His own but acting only according to the word of the Father&mdash;Exo. 21:6; Psa. 40:6; John 5:19, 30, 36; 6:38; 7:16; 8:26; 12:49; 17:4.</li>
	<li>Love is the motive and the prerequisite for a slave&rsquo;s continual service (Exo. 21:5); because the Lord Jesus loved the Father (His Master&mdash;John 14:31), the church (His wife&mdash;Eph. 5:25), and all the believers (His children&mdash;Gal. 2:20b; Eph. 5:2), He was willing to serve as a slave.</li>
	<li>All who believe in Christ, belong to Him, and have His serving life should take Him as their pattern by learning to be slaves, loving God, the church, and God&rsquo;s people&mdash;Mark 10:42-45; Phil. 2:5-8; Gal. 5:13; Eph. 5:2; Rom. 1:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A slave does not care for his own interests but is always willing to empty himself, humble himself, lower himself, sacrifice himself, and serve others.</li>
		<li>As a slave of Christ and of God, Paul was willing to empty himself, humble himself, and sacrifice his rank, rights, and privileges&mdash;1 Cor. 9:19-23.</li>
		<li>Like Paul, we can become such slaves by the serving and sacrificing life of Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 12:15; Phil. 2:17.</li>
		<li>In carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we need to have the spirit of a slave, the love of a slave, and the obedience of a slave&mdash;v. 5; Rev. 22:3b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol><h1 class="msg">Message Three</h1>
<h1 class="title">The Contents of the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s Gospel Service</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 1:14-45</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Christ as the Slave-Savior did not come to be served, but to serve; He served us in the past, He still serves us in the present, and He is going to serve us in the future&mdash;Mark 10:45; Luke 22:26-27; 12:37:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The story of the gospel and the meaning of salvation are that Christ loves and serves us first, and then we love and serve Him; whenever we have a need, we can come to the Lord and let Him serve us so that He can serve others through us&mdash;Matt. 26:13; 1 John 4:19; John 13:12-17; Rom. 1:1; Gal. 6:17; 1 John 3:16.</li>
	<li>As the life-giving Spirit, the Slave-Savior serves us by dispensing Himself as life into us so that we can become the means by which He dispenses Himself as life into others&mdash;John 10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 1 John 5:16a; 2 Cor. 3:6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to see and enter into the reality of the contents of the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s wonderful and excellent gospel service&mdash;Mark 1:14-45:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first thing the Slave-Savior did in His gospel service was to proclaim the gospel&mdash;vv. 14-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ Himself, with all the processes He passed through and all the redemptive work He accomplished, is the content of the gospel&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		<li>Christ came not only as the Messenger of God, bringing a word or a message from God to God&rsquo;s people, but also as the message sent by God; He Himself is the living message of God&mdash;vv. 1-8; Mal. 3:1-3; cf. 4:1-2.</li>
		<li>The Slave-Savior&rsquo;s proclaiming was to announce God&rsquo;s glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage; His teaching (Mark 1:21-22) was to enlighten the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of the truth.</li>
		<li>His proclaiming implied teaching, and His teaching implied proclaiming&mdash;Matt. 4:23; Mark 1:38-39; 3:14; 6:12; 14:9; 16:15, 20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The second thing the Slave-Savior did in His gospel service was to teach the truth&mdash;1:21-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The truth is the shining of the divine light on the facts of the Bible to televise a heavenly vision of those facts into our being; the truth is the shining of the light, the light is the light of life, and the life is the Spirit; thus, truth, life, and the Spirit (which are all Christ Himself) are inseparable&mdash;John 8:12, 32, 36; 1:4; 14:6a; 2 Cor. 3:6, 8, 17; cf. Rom. 8:2.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s teaching of the truth (Mark 2:13; 4:1; 6:2, 6, 30, 34; 10:1; 11:17; 12:35; 14:49) was to bring people out of the satanic darkness into the divine light (Acts 26:18); the Slave-Savior, as the light of the world (John 8:12; 9:5), came as a great light to Galilee, the land of darkness, to shine on the people who were sitting in the shadow of death (Matt. 4:12-16).</li>
		<li>His teaching released the word of light to enlighten those in the darkness of death that they might receive the light of life&mdash;John 1:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The third thing the Slave-Savior did in His gospel service was to cast out demons from the possessed people&mdash;Mark 1:23-28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The demons&rsquo; possession of people signifies Satan&rsquo;s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus came to destroy the works of Satan (1 John 3:8), and His casting out of demons (Mark 1:34, 39; 3:15; 6:7, 13; 16:17) was for people to be delivered from Satan&rsquo;s bondage (Luke 13:16), out of Satan&rsquo;s authority of darkness (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13), into God&rsquo;s kingdom (Mark 1:15).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The fourth thing the Slave-Savior did in His gospel service was to heal the sick&mdash;vv. 29-39:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Sickness issues from sin and is a sign of man&rsquo;s abnormal condition before God; the Lord healed people&rsquo;s sick condition and restored them to normality that they might serve Him&mdash;v. 34; 3:10; 6:5, 13, 56.</li>
		<li>We must learn to preach the gospel and teach the truth like a physician, giving people a heavenly prescription and the divine medicine for their healing&mdash;Matt. 9:11-13; Luke 10:33-37; cf. Prov. 4:20-23; Exo. 30:25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The fifth thing the Slave-Savior did in His gospel service was to cleanse the leper&mdash;Mark 1:40-45:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Leprosy signifies the sin of rebellion, the serious sin issuing from within man, such as willful sin, presumptuous sin, and opposing God with determination&mdash;1 John 3:4; cf. Isa. 14:12-15; Lev. 13:2; 14:9.</li>
		<li>As seen in the cases of Miriam (Num. 12:1-10), Gehazi (2 Kings 5:20-27), and Uzziah (2 Chron. 26:16-21), leprosy issues from rebellion against God&rsquo;s authority, God&rsquo;s deputy authority, God&rsquo;s regulation, and God&rsquo;s economy.</li>
		<li>In Leviticus 14:33-57 the house typifies the church as our real home, and the leprosy in the house signifies sins and evils in the church; the priest signifies the Lord or His deputy authority, and the examining of the house is not for condemnation but is a grace for healing&mdash;1 Cor. 1:11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The removing of the infected stones after seven days (Lev. 14:40) signifies that after the observation of a complete period of time, if the problem of the church is still spreading, the believer or believers involved in the problem should be removed from the fellowship of the church and be considered unclean, like the outsiders; this is done to stop the spread of the disease and to eliminate the disease&mdash;Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10.</li>
			<li>Putting other stones in the place of the removed stones (Lev. 14:42a) signifies using other believers (1 Pet. 2:5) to fill in the gap; the replastering of the house with other plaster (Lev. 14:42b) signifies the renewing of the church with new experiences of the Lord&rsquo;s gracious works; this is needed for a new start in the church life.</li>
			<li>The breaking down of the house after the infection of leprosy returns (v. 45) signifies that if the situation of a church reaches the point where it cannot be cured, that church should be terminated (cf. Rev. 2:5).</li>
			<li>If no sin is spreading after the renewing of the church with the new experiences of the Lord&rsquo;s gracious works, the church is clean and has no problem; the whole church needs to be cleansed with the eternally efficacious blood of Christ and His eternal and living Spirit so that the church is fully clean to be the mutual dwelling of God and man&mdash;Lev. 14:48-53; Heb. 9:14; 10:22; 1 John 1:9; Titus 3:5; John 14:2, 23.</li>

<li>The five incidents recorded in Mark 2:1&mdash;3:6 reveal the five merciful and living ways taken by the Slave-Savior to carry out His gospel service:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As God with divine authority, He forgave the sins of the victim of sickness that He might release him from Satan&rsquo;s oppression (Acts 10:38) and restore him to God; the scribes considered this to be against the theology of their religion&mdash;Mark 2:1-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus was both the God-Savior and the Slave-Savior, possessing deity and humanity; He had not only the ability to save sinners but also the authority to forgive their sins&mdash;Luke 5:21, 24.</li>
		<li>Receiving the forgiveness of our sins causes us to fear God (Psa. 130:4) and to love God (Luke 7:36-50); in the Lord&rsquo;s salvation He not only forgives our sins but also causes us to rise and walk, to &ldquo;go in peace&rdquo; (v. 50), and to &ldquo;go, and from now on sin no more&rdquo; (John 8:11).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As a Physician to the sick and miserable people, He feasted with the tax collectors, who were disloyal and unfaithful to their race, and with sinners, who were despised and isolated from society, that they might taste the mercy of God and be recovered to the enjoyment of God; this was condemned by the self-righteous yet merciless scribes of the Pharisees&mdash;Mark 2:13-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The self-righteous Pharisees considered themselves strong; hence, blinded by their self-righteousness, they did not know that they were ill and needed Christ as a Physician&mdash;Matt. 9:12-13.</li>
		<li>The Lord as the Physician takes care of His &ldquo;patients&rdquo; by causing them to feast with Him, bringing them into the enjoyment of God; the joy of salvation, the enjoyment of God, is a feast&mdash;1 Cor. 5:7-8; Psa. 51:2, 12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As a Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber, He caused His followers to be merry and happy without fasting; thus, He annulled the practice of the disciples of John (the new religionists) and the Pharisees (the old religionists) so that His followers could be delivered from the practices of their religion into the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s Christ as their Bridegroom, with His righteousness as their outer clothing and His life as their inner wine in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Mark 2:18-22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The real meaning of fasting is to stop eating all things other than the Lord Jesus and to not have a taste for anything other than Him&mdash;Matt. 6:16-18; Isa. 58:3; John 6:57; cf. Num. 11:4-7.</li>
		<li>Christ as the Bridegroom gains us to be His overcoming bride as His duplication by being our Physician to organically heal us in our entire tripartite being by His complete salvation&mdash;Rom. 5:10; cf. Mal. 4:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>He is our new cloth as our new garment to clothe us and beautify us with Himself as our God-given righteousness through the shedding of His precious blood applied to us for our judicial redemption&mdash;Luke 15:22; 1 Cor. 1:30; Matt. 9:16.</li>
			<li>He is our new wine as our new life to fill us and cheer us with Himself as our God-given portion through the dispensing of His priceless life into us for our organic salvation&mdash;Judg. 9:13; Matt. 9:17; Col. 1:12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>We are not only the bride of Christ but also &ldquo;the sons of the bridechamber&rdquo; (Mark 2:19) to be the corporate &ldquo;best man&rdquo; of Christ as the Bridegroom; by enjoying Him as our new garment and new wine, we become His corporate &ldquo;best man,&rdquo; the Body of Christ as the new man.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord allowed His followers to pick the ears of grain in the grainfields on the Sabbath so that they could satisfy their hunger; thus, apparently they broke God&rsquo;s commandment concerning the Sabbath, but actually they pleased God because the hunger of Christ&rsquo;s followers was satisfied through Him, as the hunger of David and his followers had been satisfied with the bread of the Presence in the house of God; this indicates that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, it is a matter not of keeping the regulation of religion but of enjoying satisfaction in and through Christ as the real Sabbath rest&mdash;vv. 23-28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The real meaning of keeping the Sabbath is that we cease from our doing, stop our work, and enjoy what the Lord has done for us by eating Him as the bread of the Presence for our nourishment and supply&mdash;Exo. 25:30.</li>
		<li>Man was not created for the Sabbath, but the Sabbath was ordained for man so that he might enjoy it with God; God first worked and then rested; man first rests and then works&mdash;Gen. 2:2-3.</li>
		<li>Keeping the Sabbath is a sign that God&rsquo;s people work for God not by their own strength but by enjoying Him and being filled with Him to be one with Him; it is also an eternal covenant assuring God that we will be one with Him by first enjoying Him and then working with Him&mdash;Exo. 31:12-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>On the Sabbath the Lord healed a man who had a withered hand, caring not for the keeping of the Sabbath but for the health of His sheep; thus He indicated that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy it is a matter not of keeping regulations but of imparting life&mdash;Mark 3:1-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is the case of a person who is partially free but not wholly free; like the man with the withered hand, we need to be fully liberated.</li>
		<li>The Slave-Savior is our Emancipator, setting us free from religious ritual and from the slavery of sin; we may be liberated to a certain extent, but in certain parts of our life we still need to be freed by the Slave-Savior&mdash;John 8:32, 36; Rom. 6:12-23; 8:2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The above five ways of the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s gospel service can be summarized by five words: <em>forgiveness</em>  (Mark 2:1-12), <em>enjoyment</em> (vv. 13-17), <em>joy</em> (vv. 18-22), <em>satisfaction</em> (vv. 23-28), and <em>freedom</em> (3:1-6); we can experience Him as our full salvation in all these aspects by touching Him (5:24-34):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we contact the Lord directly, having a direct touch with Him, He is transfused into us as the power of God to become our healing; the genuine way to help people is to bring them into a direct touch with the Lord.</li>
	<li>We all have to contact the Lord, to fellowship with Him, and to touch Him moment by moment in our spirit so that He can be our daily salvation and moment-by-moment supply for the building up of His Body&mdash;John 4:24.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 1:1-11, 35; 10:45</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In the Gospel of Mark we see a person, the God-man, who lived a life that was fully according to and for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; the Lord&rsquo;s life was His work, and His work was His move; His work was His living and His move was His being&mdash;Mark 1:35; 10:45; cf. John 6:38; 4:34:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus lived in a new dispensation, having the old dispensation terminated; the New Testament dispensation, the dispensation of grace, that is, the dispensation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, began from the preaching of John the Baptist&mdash;Mark 1:1-8; Matt. 11:13; Luke 16:16; Acts 10:37:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Instead of serving with his father Zachariah in the temple, John stayed in a wild place, wore wild clothing, ate wild food, and did a wild work; where he lived, what he wore, what he ate, and how he worked ended the Old Testament priesthood; his work was the beginning of the priesthood in the New Testament&mdash;Mark 1:1-8.</li>
		<li>The first New Testament priest of the gospel of God was John the Baptist; he did not offer bulls and goats as sacrifices (Heb. 10:1-4), but he offered sinners saved through his preaching as sacrifices, bringing them to Christ as the One stronger than he was and as the One baptizing the repentant people in the Holy Spirit for imparting life (Mark 1:4-8).</li>
		<li>In the New Testament the saved sinners are spiritual sacrifices offered to God in Christ, with Christ, and one with Christ as members of Christ, the enlargement and increase of Christ&mdash;Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When the Lord Jesus was about to begin His ministry, He had Himself buried, baptized, by John the Baptist&mdash;Mark 1:9-11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>John came in &ldquo;the way of righteousness&rdquo; (Matt. 21:32); to repent and be baptized according to John&rsquo;s preaching and practice was ordained by God according to the righteous requirements of God&rsquo;s eternal economy; hence, it is to fulfill the righteousness of God as a matter of eternity (2 Pet. 3:13).</li>
		<li>As a man in the flesh (John 1:14; Rom. 8:3), the Lord recognized that He needed to be a dead man buried in the death water to fulfill God&rsquo;s New Testament requirement according to His righteousness, and He did it willingly, considering it as the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s righteousness (Matt. 3:15).</li>
		<li>By His baptism He declared to the whole universe that He did not depend at all upon the flesh for God&rsquo;s ministry; instead, He rejected Himself, put Himself aside, in order to live by God; this is the intrinsic significance of the base of Jesus&rsquo; baptism.</li>
		<li>We all should declare in our life and work: &ldquo;I am a person in the flesh, worthy of nothing in the eyes of God but death and burial; so I want to have myself terminated, crucified and buried.&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Immediately after His baptism the Lord Jesus was thrust into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit (Mark 1:12-13); from that time onward He fulfilled His ministry by living, moving, and working in the Holy Spirit:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He preached the gospel (vv. 14-20), taught the truth (vv. 21-22), cast out demons (vv. 23-28), healed the sick (vv. 29-39), and cleansed the leper (vv. 40-45); the result of such a life, fully according to and for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, was for people to experience the Lord as their forgiveness (2:1-12), enjoyment (vv. 13-17), joy (vv. 18-22), satisfaction (vv. 23-28), and freedom (3:1-6).</li>
		<li>While the Lord Jesus was carrying out such a gospel service, He was also binding Satan and plundering his kingdom (vv. 22-30), denying any natural relationship (vv. 31-35), suffering the world&rsquo;s rejection and hatred (6:1-6), and exposing man&rsquo;s inward evil condition (7:1-23).</li>
		<li>Then He presented Himself as the bread of life to be the life supply to His seeking one&mdash;vv. 24-30.</li>
		<li>He healed the hearing, speaking, and seeing organs of the enlivened ones&mdash;vv. 31-37; 8:22-26.</li>
		<li>He revealed Himself as our universal and entire replacement through His all-inclusive death and wonderful resurrection&mdash;8:27&mdash;9:13.</li>
		<li>He accomplished an all-inclusive death to bear our sins (1 Pet. 2:24; 1 Cor. 15:3), condemn sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3), crucify the old man (6:6; Gal. 2:20), terminate the old creation (Col. 1:15; Exo. 26:31; Matt. 27:51), destroy Satan (Heb. 2:14), judge the world (John 12:31), abolish the ordinances (Eph. 2:15), and release the divine life (John 12:24; 19:34).</li>
		<li>He then entered into His wonderful resurrection to regenerate His followers and germinate the new creation&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		<li>After His resurrection the Lord Jesus &ldquo;was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God&rdquo; (Mark 16:19); He now remains in His ascension to execute what He has accomplished through His death and resurrection.</li>
		<li>By bringing His followers into His death, resurrection, and ascension (Gal. 2:20; Eph. 2:6), He brought forth the new man (v. 15) as the reality of the kingdom of God, issuing in the church, developing into the millennium, and consummating in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth; this will be our eternal destiny, and this is also the conclusion of the Scriptures (Rev. 21:9&mdash;22:5).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Gospel of Mark conveys a heavenly vision of a life that lives and expresses God as a complete, whole, perfect, and entire pattern of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; this governing vision directs our steps, controls our living, and brings us into God&rsquo;s consummation&mdash;Prov. 29:18a; Acts 26:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The life that the Lord Jesus lived is now our life; today we are His expansion, increase, and continuation, and we should continue to live the kind of life He lived; God has put us into Christ that we may live a life of Christ to carry out His New Testament economy&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 2:20.</li>
	<li>This life indwelling our spirit is a law that automatically lives and expresses Christ to produce the Body; any other way of living is a factor of division that damages the Body&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 6, 10-11; Gal. 5:22; Eph. 4:3-6.</li>
	<li>The life we live today should be Christ Himself; only a life that is Christ is fully according to and for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Col. 3:4; Phil. 1:21a.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to sow the living person of Christ into our being so that we may live a life that is fully according to and for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Mark 4:1-20, 26-29:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ as the Sower is the Messenger of God, Christ as the seed is the message of God as the gospel of God, and Christ sown into our being to grow and develop in us is the building of God and the kingdom of God as the goal of God&mdash;Luke 17:20-24; Mal. 1:1; 3:1-3; Heb. 1:2; 1 Cor. 3:6-9; 2 Sam. 7:12-14a.</li>
	<li>Christ as the Sower has sown Himself as the life-giving Spirit into us; the life-giving Spirit in our spirit is the seed of a life that lives fully according to and for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;John 14:6a; 10:10b; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 1 John 3:9; 5:11-12; 1 Pet. 1:23; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:21a; Rom. 8:2, 4, 6.</li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a work, teaching, theology, or movement; the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the living Christ as the seed of life sown into our being.</li>
	<li>The kingdom of God, which is Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit, is a seed; the kingdom comes by the growth of the indwelling Christ in us&mdash;Mark 4:26; Luke 17:20-24; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
	<li>We must give the Lord our full cooperation for the inward operation of His growth process in us so that we may hasten His coming&mdash;Gal. 1:15-16a; 2:20; 4:19; Rev. 19:7; 2 Pet. 3:11-12; cf. Luke 12:32.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to live a life that is fully according to and for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we must allow the indwelling Christ as the seed of life to grow in the soil of our entire heart, thus making our heart His home and a duplication of God&rsquo;s heart&mdash;Mark 4:1-20; 12:30; Eph. 3:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although man&rsquo;s heart is corrupt and deceitful and its condition is incurable (Jer. 17:9; Mark 7:21-23), even such a heart can be a tablet upon which God writes His law of life (Jer. 31:33; cf. 2 Cor. 3:3) by the spontaneous growth of Christ as the seed of life in man&rsquo;s heart (Mark 4:26-29); this is God&rsquo;s way, according to His economy, to deal with the heart of fallen man.</li>
	<li>We must deal with the condition of our heart to make our heart the good earth for the full growth of Christ in us&mdash;Col. 2:19; Gal. 4:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by worldly traffic and cannot open to understand, to comprehend, the word of the kingdom; the birds signify the evil one, Satan, who comes and snatches away the word of the kingdom sown in the hardened heart&mdash;Mark 4:3-4, 15:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The anti-God world system with its worldly traffic is the system of Satan, who is the ruler of the world; we must be strengthened into our spirit, our inner man, and remain in our spirit so that we can overcome the world and be kept from the evil one by remaining in the pneumatic Christ for Him to make His home in our heart&mdash;1 John 2:14-15; 5:4, 18; John 12:31; 14:30; Eph. 3:16-17a.</li>
			<li>We need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly; His word works in us to separate us from anything worldly and to saturate us with the reality of the Triune God&mdash;Col. 3:16; John 17:17; Eph. 5:26.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The rocky places that do not have much earth signify the heart that is shallow in receiving the Lord&rsquo;s word, having &ldquo;no root&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 4:5-6, 16-17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The sun with its scorching heat signifies affliction or persecution; the scorching heat of the sun causes the seed that is not rooted to wither.</li>
			<li>The heat of the sun is for the growth and ripening of the crop, which take place once the seed has been deeply rooted, but because of the seed&rsquo;s lack of root, the sun&rsquo;s heat, which should cause growth and ripening, becomes a deathblow to the seed.</li>
			<li>In order to have Christ as the seed of life deeply rooted in us, we need to be deeply rooted in Him by having a secret life and secret history with Him&mdash;Col. 2:7; S. S. 4:12; Psa. 31:20; 32:7; 83:3; 91:1; 119:114.</li>
			<li>We must take time in secret to absorb Him, setting aside time every morning to have direct and intimate fellowship with the Lord in pray-reading His word and interceding for the interests of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Mark 1:35; Matt. 6:6; Psa. 5:3; 27:4; 46:5; 59:16; 88:13; 90:14; 119:148; 143:8; 1 Kings 8:48.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The thorns signify the anxieties of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things, which utterly choke the word, preventing it from growing in the heart and causing it to become unfruitful&mdash;Mark 4:7, 18-19:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Anxiety is the gear that makes the world move; to allow the Lord to deal with our anxiety is to allow Him to deal with the gear of our human life; our human life is a life of anxiety, whereas God&rsquo;s life is a life of enjoyment, rest, comfort, and satisfaction; we must habitually fellowship with God in prayer to be infused with Him as life and peace, the antidote to anxiety&mdash;Phil. 4:6-7; John 16:33.</li>
			<li>To be deceived by riches is to suppose &ldquo;godliness to be a means of gain&rdquo;; because of pride and the desire for profit, for riches, some today are teaching differently; to maintain the victorious standard of the church, we need to be lovers of God for the economy of God, not lovers of money for the system of Satan&mdash;1 Tim. 6:3-10; 2 Tim. 3:1-5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The good earth signifies a heart that gives every inch of its ground to receive the word that the word may grow, bear fruit, and produce even a hundredfold&mdash;Mark 4:8-9, 20, 26-29; Luke 8:15:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the Lord is sowing Himself into people so that He may have the good earth to grow Himself into the kingdom.</li>
			<li>Day by day and morning and evening, we must keep our heart open to the Lord by repenting and confessing all our sins to Him; this is the way to deal with our heart to make it the good earth for the growth of Christ as the seed of life&mdash;Mark 1:4-5, 15; 2 Cor. 3:16; 1 John 1:9.</li>
			<li>Giving the Lord the full way to grow in our heart will make our heart the duplicate of God&rsquo;s heart, and we will live a life fully according to and for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy to carry out His heart&rsquo;s desire&mdash;<em>Hymns,</em> #395, #1132.</li>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 4:3, 11, 14, 26-29</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The New Testament reveals that the Triune God has been incarnated in order to be sown into His chosen people and then to develop within them into a kingdom; this is the intrinsic element of the entire teaching of the New Testament&mdash;John 1:14; Col. 2:9; Mark 4:26-29; Rev. 11:15; 21:2.</li>
<li>God&rsquo;s economy concerning His kingdom was a hidden mystery, which has been unveiled to the Lord&rsquo;s disciples&mdash;Mark 4:11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the nature and character of the kingdom of God are wholly divine, and the elements through which it is brought forth are the divine life and the divine light, the kingdom of God, especially in its reality as the genuine church in this age, is still entirely a mystery to the natural man&mdash;vv. 3, 21, 26; 1 Cor. 2:14.</li>
	<li>Divine revelation is required to understand the kingdom of God&mdash;Eph. 1:17-18; 3:3; Rom. 16:25-26.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The kingdom of God is not merely a material realm in which God rules over His people and exercises His authority to carry out His governmental administration so that they may enter into this realm to enjoy eternal blessing; the kingdom of God is actually God Himself&mdash;Mark 1:15; Matt. 6:33; John 3:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God Himself is everything as the content of His kingdom&mdash;1 Cor. 4:20; 15:28.</li>
	<li>God is life, having the nature, ability, and shape of the divine life, which forms the realm of God&rsquo;s ruling&mdash;John 3:15; cf. Eph. 4:18.</li>
	<li>The life of God is the kingdom of God, and the kingdom of God is the realm of the divine life for this life to move, to work, to rule, and to govern so that life may accomplish its purpose&mdash;John 3:3.</li>
	<li>Those who live in the kingdom of God have God as their life; God lives in them, through them, and out of them, and thus they express God&mdash;Phil. 1:21a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The kingdom of God is Christ Himself as the seed of life sown into us, growing in us, spreading in us, and maturing in us until there is a full harvest&mdash;the manifestation of the kingdom&mdash;Mark 4:26-29; Matt. 13:43:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This is revealed in the parable of the seed in Mark 4:26-29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The man in verse 26 is the Son of God as the Sower who came to sow Himself as the seed of life in His word (v. 14) into men&rsquo;s hearts so that He might grow and live in them and be expressed from within them.</li>
		<li>The seed is the seed of the divine life sown into the Lord&rsquo;s believers&mdash;1 John 3:9; 1 Pet. 1:23.</li>
		<li>The casting of the seed on the earth indicates that the kingdom of God, which is the issue and goal of the Lord&rsquo;s gospel, and the church in this age (Rom. 14:17) are a matter of the life of God, which sprouts, grows, bears fruit, matures, and produces a harvest&mdash;Mark 4:26.</li>
		<li>Christ establishes the kingdom by sowing Himself as the seed of life into believing people so that the kingdom may grow; this is absolutely a matter of the growth in life, not of our work&mdash;1 Pet. 1:23; 1 John 3:9; Matt. 13:8.</li>
		<li>Regeneration is the entrance into the kingdom of God, and the growth of the divine life within the believers is the development of the kingdom of God&mdash;John 3:3, 5; 2 Pet. 1:3-11.</li>
		<li>The kingdom of God is the reality of the church brought forth by the resurrection life of Christ through the gospel&mdash;Rom. 14:17; 1 Cor. 4:15.</li>
		<li>The seed of the kingdom is Jesus, and the development of the seed in the aggregate of the believers is the kingdom; this aggregate is the church&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The kingdom of God is actually the God-man, the Lord Jesus, sown as a seed into the believers and developing into a realm over which God can rule as His kingdom in His divine life&mdash;Luke 17:20-21; Mark 4:3, 26-29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom of God is a wonderful person&mdash;the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God&mdash;Matt. 16:16.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus, who is the embodiment of the Triune God, came to be the kingdom of God by sowing Himself as the seed of the kingdom into God&rsquo;s chosen people&mdash;Col. 2:9; Luke 17:20-21; Matt. 13:3-23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord is both the Sower and the seed sown; as the Sower, the Lord sows Himself as the seed of life through His word&mdash;Mark 4:3, 14.</li>
			<li>God&rsquo;s life, which is Christ Himself, is the seed of the realm of the divine life that develops into the kingdom for His ruling&mdash;vv. 3, 26-29.</li>
			<li>The One who has been sown into us as a seed is the kingdom gene; the full development of this kingdom gene will be God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom in the new heaven and new earth&mdash;Rev. 21:1-2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>After this seed has been sown into the believers, it will grow and develop within them into the kingdom of God, which is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and also for their blessing and enjoyment&mdash;Col. 1:13.</li>
		<li>The development of the kingdom within us is our entering into the kingdom of God&mdash;2 Pet. 1:3-11:

<h1 class="title">The Kingdom of God<br />

The Kingdom as the Subduing of Rebellion<br />
and as the Transfiguration of the Lord Jesus</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 4:35-41; 9:1-13</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The kingdom of God is the power to subdue rebellion&mdash;Mark 4:35-41:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There are two great principles in the universe&mdash;God&rsquo;s authority and Satan&rsquo;s rebellion; the unique controversy between God and Satan concerns authority and rebellion&mdash;Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Rebellion is the denial of God&rsquo;s authority and the rejection of God&rsquo;s rule:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Satan was originally an archangel created by God, but due to his pride he uplifted himself, violated God&rsquo;s sovereignty, rebelled against God, became God&rsquo;s adversary, and established his own kingdom&mdash;Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:2-19; Matt. 12:26.</li>
			<li>When man sinned, he rebelled against God, denied God&rsquo;s authority, and rejected God&rsquo;s rule; at Babel men rebelled collectively against God to abolish God&rsquo;s authority from the earth&mdash;Gen. 3:1-6; 11:1-9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Although Satan rebelled against God&rsquo;s authority and although man violates His authority by rebelling against Him, God will not let this rebellion continue; He will establish His kingdom on the earth&mdash;Rev. 11:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Mark 1:14-15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The kingdom of God is a divine realm where God can exercise His authority to work out His plan&mdash;Matt. 6:10, 33; Luke 12:32; Col. 1:13.</li>
		<li>As God incarnate, the Lord Jesus came to establish the kingdom of God&mdash;to establish a realm in which God can carry out His purpose through the exercise of His authority&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 3:3, 5; 18:36:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>To establish the kingdom of God, the Lord Jesus stood as a victorious man, defeating Satan and withstanding all hardship, opposition, and attack&mdash;Mark 1:13; Matt. 4:1-11.</li>
			<li>The Lord Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom so that rebellious sinners might repent and be saved, qualified, and equipped to enter into the kingdom of God&mdash;Mark 1:14-15; Matt. 4:17.</li>
			<li>The Lord bound Satan, the strong man, and entered into his house to plunder his goods so that sinners might be brought into the house of God through regeneration for the kingdom of God&mdash;Mark 3:27; Eph. 2:19.</li>
			<li>As the Lord cast out demons by the Spirit of God, He was destroying Satan&rsquo;s kingdom and bringing in the kingdom of God&mdash;Matt. 12:28.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The record in Mark 4:35-41 is a picture of rebellion and of the kingdom of God as the power to subdue rebellion:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Satan has a kingdom, the authority of darkness, which is against the kingdom of God&mdash;Matt. 12:26; Acts 26:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The demons belong to Satan&rsquo;s kingdom and possess people for his kingdom&mdash;Mark 1:23-27; 5:2-20; 7:25-30; 9:17-27; 16:9.</li>
			<li>Satan is the ruler of the world and of the authority of the air; he has his angels, who are his subordinates as rulers, authorities, and world-rulers of the darkness of this world&mdash;John 12:31; Eph. 2:2; 6:12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Between the word concerning the kingdom of God in Mark 4:26-29 and the record of the demonstration of the kingdom of God in 5:1-20, there is the incident of the stormy sea in 4:35-41:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The fallen angels in the air and the demons in the water collaborated to frustrate the Lord Jesus from going to the other side of the sea because they knew that He would cast out the demons there&mdash;5:1-20.</li>
			<li>The Lord rebuked the wind and commanded the sea to be silent because of the rebellious angels and demons who were behind the scene.</li>
			<li>After He rebuked the wind and spoke to the sea, the wind ceased, and there was a great calm, for the rebellion of the evil angels and the demons had been subdued by the power of the kingdom&mdash;4:39.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The kingdom of God is the transfiguration of the Lord Jesus&mdash;9:1-13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>What is described in Mark 9:1-13 is a picture of the kingdom of God coming in power; the center of this picture is the glorified Jesus, and with Him are Moses and Elijah, representing the Old Testament saints, and Peter, James, and John, representing the New Testament saints&mdash;vv. 2-4.</li>
	<li>For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity; this transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom&mdash;v. 2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word in verse 1 about the coming of the kingdom of God in power was fulfilled by His transfiguration on the mountain&mdash;vv. 2-3.</li>
		<li>The transfiguration, the shining, of the Lord Jesus was His coming in His kingdom; where His transfiguration is, there is the coming of the kingdom&mdash;Matt. 16:28&mdash;17:13; Luke 9:27-36.</li>
		<li>The transfiguration of the Lord Jesus was the realization of what He is.</li>
		<li>The kingdom is the shining of the reality of the Lord Jesus; to be under His shining is to be in the kingdom&mdash;Rev. 22:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ has been sown into our heart as a seed; this seed will grow and develop until it blossoms and is manifested in glory&mdash;Mark 4:26-29; Col. 3:3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In Mark 9 we see the transfiguration of Christ as the seed sown in Mark 4.</li>
		<li>The One whom we have received as the seed of the kingdom of God needs to grow in us until He blossoms from within us; this blossoming will be the transfiguration of the Lord in us in a practical, experiential way&mdash;Col. 1:27.</li>
		<li>When Christ is transfigured within us, that transfiguration becomes the kingdom of God ruling over everything in our life&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		<li>The church as the kingdom of God cannot exist in the natural life but can exist only in this realm of transfiguration&mdash;Rom. 14:17.</li>
		<li>If we are willing to lose our soul-life for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we will experience a prevailing transfiguration in the church life; this transfiguration will be a genuine revival&mdash;Mark 8:35-38; Matt. 16:25-27.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Highlight of the Gospel of Mark</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 8:27&mdash;9:13;<br />
13:8; 14:3-9</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The highlight of the Gospel of Mark is the vision of Christ&rsquo;s person with His all-inclusive death and His wonderful resurrection to be our entire, all-inclusive replacement for the producing, the bringing forth, of the one new man in the manifestation of the kingdom&mdash;8:27&mdash;9:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>After the Lord&rsquo;s followers passed though the steps recorded in Mark 1:1&mdash;8:26 (experiencing the healing of their hearing, speaking, and seeing organs), they were qualified and able to see a wonderful person, who is the secret of the universe, a mystery to all mankind, and the secret of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;7:31-37; 8:14-26; Acts 17:23; cf. John 1:18; Phil. 3:8, 10.</li>
	<li>After Peter made the declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the Lord began to unveil the mysteries of God&rsquo;s economy concerning Christ as the Son of Man with His death and resurrection; the Lord then brought His disciples to the mount of His transfiguration in order to show them that God&rsquo;s desire in His economy is for everything and everyone to be replaced by Christ, the all-inclusive One&mdash;Mark 8:27-37; 9:7-8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the life-giving Spirit, with His death and resurrection, replaces everything and everyone; He replaces Moses, He replaces Elijah, and He replaces us; this One replaces everyone, everything, and every matter in the universe&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; Eph. 1:23; 1 Cor. 15:28; Col. 3:10-11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>For Peter to make his absurd proposal to keep Moses (representing the law) and Elijah (representing the prophets) on the same level with Christ was for him to make the law and the prophets equal with Christ to replace Christ&mdash;Mark 9:4-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy Jesus is today&rsquo;s Moses, imparting Himself as the law of the Spirit of life into His believers, and He is also today&rsquo;s Elijah, speaking Himself as the Word of life into His believers&mdash;Heb. 8:10; Rom. 8:2; Acts 3:22; Phil. 2:16; 1 John 1:1; John 6:63; Acts 5:20.</li>
		<li>Being according to the law means to walk according to the &ldquo;letter&rdquo; of outward statutes and regulations; being according to the prophets means to walk according to what other men say; being according to Christ is to walk according to the Spirit mingled with our spirit, the mingled spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 3:6; Gal. 1:10; 2:2; 1 Thes. 2:4; Gal. 5:25; Phil. 3:3; Rom. 1:9; 8:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, now that Christ has come, we should &ldquo;hear Him&rdquo;; we should no longer hear the law or the prophets, since the law and the prophets were fulfilled in and by Him; to &ldquo;hear Him&rdquo; is to hear what the pneumatic Christ as the speaking Spirit says in our spirit and to the churches for the testimony of &ldquo;Jesus only&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 9:7-8; 2 Cor. 13:3; Matt. 10:20; Eph. 5:26; Rev. 2:7; 1:2.</li>
	<li>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy we should look away unto Jesus (Heb. 12:2) to see no one except &ldquo;Jesus only&rdquo; (Mark 9:8); no one except &ldquo;Jesus only&rdquo; should remain in the New Testament (Acts 9:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:12; Col. 3:10-11).</li>
	<li>Christ is God&rsquo;s Beloved, God&rsquo;s Favorite; He is the One who replaces everyone and everything; therefore, He should have all the ground in our living; everything in our living should be given over to Him so that we may live Christ, grow Christ, express Christ, and propagate Christ in every respect&mdash;1:10-11.</li>
	<li>God does not want anything of what we are in ourselves; God wants only Christ; to deny ourselves is to be replaced by Christ as the Spirit so that we may live Christ for His magnification&mdash;Mark 8:34; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 11:24; Phil. 1:19-21a.</li>
	<li>The Lord &ldquo;went up into the mountain to pray...and as He prayed, the appearance of His face became different, and His garment dazzling white&rdquo; (Luke 9:28-29); the Lord&rsquo;s pattern here shows that we can be replaced with the God of glory to be transfigured, conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory, through the process of the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming us from glory to glory by our prayer (2 Cor. 3:16, 18; Phil. 3:21; 4:6-7).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The entire world situation is for the producing of the new man; from the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection until He comes back is the period of a long delivery of the new man through the preaching of the gospel and the suffering of persecutions, which are &ldquo;birth pangs&rdquo; as the travail involved in the birth of the new man&mdash;Mark 13:3-8; Gal. 4:19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy is to produce the new man, and in the new man Christ is everyone, Christ is in everyone, and Christ is everything; when we enjoy Christ as the universal replacement, He becomes everything to us, for He replaces us with Himself&mdash;Col. 3:10-11; Gal. 2:20.</li>
	<li><em>Birth pangs</em> refers to all the tribulations in the New Testament age, including wars, famines, earthquakes, afflictions, and persecutions; birth pangs for the delivery of the new man are suffered only by the New Testament believers for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, whereas the travailing in birth in Revelation 12:2 refers to all the travailings suffered throughout the generations by God&rsquo;s people in both the Old Testament and the New Testament&mdash;Matt. 24:6-9, 21.</li>
	<li>In one sense, a child, the new man, was born at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (John 16:20-22), but in another sense, the universal new man revealed in Ephesians 2 and 4 has not been fully delivered (2:15; 4:24).</li>
	<li>When the Lord comes back, there will be a rapture, which will be the final delivery of the new man; we believe that we are living at the end of that period of time in which the new man is being delivered&mdash;Dan. 2:28, 44-45; 8:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We can enjoy Christ as our replacement in the church life, which is depicted by the house of Simon the leper as a house of feasting in and with the presence of the Lord, to bring forth the new man&mdash;Mark 14:3-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Mary received the revelation of the Lord&rsquo;s death through the Lord&rsquo;s words, and she anointed His body beforehand for burial, implying His death and resurrection; hence, she grasped the opportunity to pour upon the Lord the best that she had; to love the Lord with our best requires a revelation concerning Him as our all-inclusive replacement.</li>
	<li>In the church life we have Christ as our replacement; we in the church life are lepers who have been cleansed by Him to love Him supremely, and in our hearts there is room only for Him&mdash;cf. Col. 1:18b; Psa. 73:25-26.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As our replacement, the transfigured Christ is the all-inclusive, processed, indwelling life-giving Spirit in our spirit, and we have become one spirit with Him; as we live in and by the Spirit and even live this Spirit, He will become in us the reality of Christ with His death, resurrection, and ascension as our complete and full enjoyment; this is the way of the divine delivery of the new man to bring Christ back&mdash;Gal. 5:25; John 16:13; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17; cf. Eph. 4:3-4a, 23-24; Col. 3:10-11.</li>

<h1 class="title">Taking Up Our Cross and<br />
Praying with God as Our Faith</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 8:31-38; 9:28-29; 11:20-24</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In order to follow the Lord Jesus, we need to deny the self, take up our cross, and lose our soul-life&mdash;Mark 8:34-35:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we set our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, we become Satan, a stumbling block to the Lord (Matt. 16:23) in the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose (Mark 8:33); setting the mind on the things of men is a matter of the evil reasonings mentioned in 7:21.</li>
	<li>We need to deny the self&mdash;8:34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The self is the embodiment of Satan; the self is the soul plus the mind of Satan&mdash;Gen. 3:1-6; Mark 8:32-33:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The origin of the self was Satan&rsquo;s injecting his thought into the human mind; when the mind of Satan was injected into the human soul, the soul was corrupted and became the self&mdash;Gen. 3:1-6.</li>
			<li>The self, which is one with Satan, is expressed through the mind, which is actually the opinionated thoughts&mdash;Mark 8:33.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The self is independent of God; it does not care for God&rsquo;s will or for God&rsquo;s interest.</li>
		<li>To deny the self is to reject the self with its desire, preference, and choice.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To take up our cross is to make the cross of Christ our cross&mdash;v. 34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Taking up the cross is not a matter of suffering but of applying to our life what Christ has done on the cross to terminate us&mdash;Gal. 5:24.</li>
		<li>The three aspects of the work of the cross are the accomplished fact of our crucifixion with Christ, the realization of the accomplished fact, and continually bearing the cross to deny the self&mdash;Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20.</li>
		<li>To take up our cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the termination of our self, our natural life, and our old man; in so doing, we deny our self so that we may follow the Lord.</li>
		<li>The application of the cross is in the Spirit and by the Spirit; the real bearing of the cross for the denial of the self must be in the power, strength, and energy of the Spirit&mdash;Rom. 8:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To follow after the Lord is to gain Him, to experience Him, to enjoy Him, to partake of Him, and to let Him become our very being&mdash;Mark 8:34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If we want to follow after the Lord in this way, we must put the self aside and forget the self.</li>
		<li>Because Christ is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit, we follow Him in an inward way, in our spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Tim. 4:22; Gal. 5:16, 25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To save the soul-life is to please the self by allowing the soul to have its enjoyment and not to suffer; to lose the soul-life is to lose the enjoyment of the soul and to suffer in the soul&mdash;Mark 8:35-38:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by the self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, and our opinion.</li>
		<li>Not loving our soul-life means that we are willing to give up our soul-life and that we do not care for our soul-life&mdash;Rev. 12:11.</li>
		<li>We should lose our soul-life for the sake of the Lord and also for the sake of the gospel; this is to live Christ and to live the gospel&mdash;Mark 8:35.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Prayer is the real denial of the self&mdash;9:28-29:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word in verse 29 indicates that the disciples failed to pray; that was the reason they could not cast out the demon.</li>
		<li>To pray is to deny ourselves, realizing that we are nothing and that we can do nothing&mdash;v. 29; 8:34.</li>
		<li>The word <em>prayer</em> in 9:29 means in practice that &ldquo;it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20); therefore, to pray is actually to declare, &ldquo;Not I, but Christ.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>One who prays in a genuine way has been terminated and has become ashes; his natural life has been completely terminated by the cross&mdash;Lev. 6:9-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to pray with God as our faith&mdash;Mark 11:20-24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Prayer is man cooperating and co-working with God, allowing God to express Himself through man and thus accomplish His purpose&mdash;Rom. 8:26-27.</li>
	<li>In Mark 11:20-24 the Lord Jesus taught His disciples to pray by faith for executing God&rsquo;s will according to God&rsquo;s economy:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our prayer should carry out God&rsquo;s will to have the Body of Christ, which will consummate the New Jerusalem&mdash;Eph. 1:9, 22-23; Rev. 21:2.</li>
		<li>When the praying one is mingled with God and is one with God, God becomes his faith; this is what it means to have faith in God&mdash;Mark 11:22.</li>
		<li>Only prayers that are out of faith will touch God; without faith prayer is ineffectual&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		<li>Faith is believing that we have received what we have asked for&mdash;v. 24:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>According to the Lord&rsquo;s word, we should believe that we have received, not that we will receive.</li>
			<li>To hope means to expect something in the future; to believe means to consider something as having been done.</li>
			<li>Faith is not only believing that God can or will do a certain thing but also believing that God has done that thing already.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The prayer in Mark 11:20-24 is a prayer with authority; this kind of prayer is directed not toward God but toward &ldquo;this mountain&rdquo;&mdash;v. 23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A prayer with authority does not ask God to do something; instead, it exercises God&rsquo;s authority and applies this authority to deal with problems and things that ought to be removed&mdash;Zech. 4:7; Matt. 21:21.</li>
		<li>God has commissioned us to command what He has commanded and give orders to what He has given orders to&mdash;17:20.</li>
		<li>The church can have such a prayer with authority by having full faith, being without doubt, and being clear that what we do is fully according to God&rsquo;s will&mdash;6:10; 18:19-20.</li>
		<li>Prayer with authority has much to do with the overcomers; every overcomer must learn to speak to &ldquo;this mountain&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 11:23.</li>

		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s supper should serve as a reminder that we are living on earth for the Lord&rsquo;s satisfaction; eating the supper reminds us to have a life in the church to bring in the kingdom for the satisfaction of the Lord Jesus&mdash;Mark 14:25.</li>

	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s supper, His table, is a symbol of the entire New Testament economy of God&mdash;Mark 14:22-26:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament age is involved with the Lord&rsquo;s table&mdash;1 Tim. 1:4; 1 Cor. 10:16-17, 21.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is that God became flesh, passed through human living, died, resurrected, and became the life-giving Spirit to enter into us as our life and to dispense Himself into us so that we may be transformed for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ&mdash;John 1:14; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s economy is a matter not of outward things but of Christ coming into us as food&mdash;John 6:35, 53-57; Mark 7:27-28.</li>
	<li>In Mark 14:12-26 the Lord Jesus partook of the Feast of the Passover and then instituted His supper, His table, with the bread and the cup:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He initiated this new practice for the believers&rsquo; remembrance of Him to replace the passover feast, the old testament practice of Israel&rsquo;s remembrance of Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;Exo. 12:14.</li>
		<li>The Lord has fulfilled the type and has become the real Passover to us; now we are keeping the real Feast of Unleavened Bread&mdash;1 Cor. 5:7-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>This new practice of the new testament is to remember the Lord by eating the bread, which signifies His body given for us, His believers, and drinking the cup, which signifies His blood shed for our sins&mdash;11:24-25; Matt. 26:28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The bread denotes life, the life of God, the eternal life&mdash;John 6:35; 3:15.</li>
		<li>The cup denotes blessing, which is God Himself as our portion&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16; Psa. 16:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>As sinners, our portion should have been the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath, but the Lord Jesus drank this cup for us&mdash;Rev. 14:10; John 18:11.</li>
			<li>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation has become our portion, the cup of salvation that runs over, the content of which is God as our all-inclusive blessing&mdash;Psa. 116:13; 23:5.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Such a bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Lord&rsquo;s supper, which is a table, a feast, set up by Him that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast&mdash;Mark 14:22-24.</li>
		<li>Our eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord at His supper are our declaration and our testimony:

			<li>Our declaration is that we are joined to the Lord and are mingled with Him, just as the bread becomes mingled with us after being received into our body&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; John 6:56-57.</li>
			<li>Our testimony is that we live by eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord, taking Him as our life every day&mdash;1 Cor. 10:3-4.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus &ldquo;took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is My body&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 14:22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The bread signifies the Lord&rsquo;s physical body that He gave for us on the cross in order to impart His life into us&mdash;Luke 22:19.</li>
		<li>The bread also signifies the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body, the means for Christ to carry out His heavenly ministry for the accomplishment of the divine administration&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 4:16; Rev. 5:6.</li>
		<li>By participating in the Lord&rsquo;s divine life, we become the mystical Body of Christ, His enlargement; by enjoying the bread, we become Christ&rsquo;s mystical Body&mdash;1 Cor. 10:17.</li>
		<li>Eating the bread of the Lord&rsquo;s table indicates that the Lord comes into us as our life supply and then becomes us by being mingled with us&mdash;Col. 3:4.</li>
		<li>In our remembrance of the Lord, the bread comes before the cup, because the bread symbolizes the Body of Christ as the focus of God&rsquo;s original plan and as the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose&mdash;Eph. 3:10-11; 1:22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus &ldquo;took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them...and He said to them, This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 14:23-24:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The blood of Christ as the blood of the new covenant ushers God&rsquo;s people into the new covenant, in which God gives His people a new heart, a new spirit, His Spirit, and the inner law of life&mdash;Luke 22:20; Heb. 8:10-12.</li>
		<li>Ultimately, the blood of the covenant, the eternal covenant, leads God&rsquo;s people into the full enjoyment of God as the tree of life and the water of life both now and for eternity&mdash;13:20; Rev. 7:14, 17; 22:1-2, 14, 17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By instituting His supper, His table, the Lord Jesus indicated to His followers that they would enter into His death and resurrection, He prepared them to receive His death and resurrection, and He served them not only with His body and blood but also with His death, His resurrection, Himself, and His enlargement, His mystical Body&mdash;Rom. 6:6; Eph. 2:5-6; 4:16.</li>
	<li>The Lord&rsquo;s death, His resurrection, the Lord Himself, and His enlargement are for the producing of the new man as the full development of the seed of the kingdom&mdash;Mark 4:26-29.</li>
	<li>Today the Lord Jesus is still bringing us into the reality of His table for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;Matt. 26:26-30; 1 Cor. 11:23-26; Eph. 1:10.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Death, Resurrection, and Ascension<br />
of the Slave-Savior<br />
and His Universal Spreading of the Gospel<br />
through His Disciples</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 10:45; 15:22-39; 16:1-6, 15-16, 19-20</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The entire Gospel of Mark is summarized in Peter&rsquo;s word in Acts 10:36-43.</li>
<li>There are at least three reasons why it was necessary for the Lord Jesus, the Slave-Savior, to be crucified:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man became fallen, and creation was corrupted by God&rsquo;s enemy; therefore, both man and creation needed to be judged&mdash;Rom. 3:23; 8:20-21; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18.</li>
	<li>Christ died in order to bring the old creation, including mankind, to an end; only in this way could He produce a new creation&mdash;Col. 1:15, 20; Heb. 2:9.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus was crucified so that He could impart Himself into us as our life and life supply&mdash;John 12:24; 19:34.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In His redeeming death on the cross, the Slave-Savior gave His life as a ransom for many&mdash;Mark 10:45:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word <em>ransom</em> in 10:45 indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s redemption was His service rendered to sinners for God&rsquo;s plan.</li>
	<li>In His humanity the Lord served sinners even by giving His life, that is, His soul-life; the Lord&rsquo;s soul-life was the ransom, the price, He paid for many&mdash;John 10:11.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus did a great work in paying the price for us, giving His soul-life as a ransom to pay off our debt before God according to God&rsquo;s nature, justice, and requirements and under the watching of the enemy&mdash;Rom. 5:18.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s giving His human life as a ransom for many took place under the process of God&rsquo;s judgment&mdash;8:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>While He was being judged by God for us, He gave up His soul-life as a ransom, as a payment, for us.</li>
		<li>God put our sins upon Him, regarding Him as the unique sinner, even as sin itself; as a result, God forsook Him, leaving Him alone under His judgment&mdash;1 Pet. 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When God was judging Christ as our Substitute, who was made sin for us and was bearing our sins, God forsook Christ economically&mdash;Mark 15:22-39:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus was judged by God for the accomplishment of redemption, and God counted Him as our suffering Substitute for sin&mdash;Isa. 53:10a.</li>
	<li>Our sin and sins and all negative things were dealt with on the cross, and God forsook the Slave-Savior because of our sin&mdash;Mark 15:33-34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners, bearing our sins and being made sin for us&mdash;1 Pet. 3:18; 2:24; Isa. 53:6; 2 Cor. 5:21.</li>
		<li>In the sight of God, Christ became a great sinner, and God judged Him as our Substitute for our sins&mdash; John 3:14; Rom. 8:3.</li>
		<li>Christ was our Substitute and was even sin in the sight of God; therefore, God judged Him and even forsook Him.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Because Christ bore our sins and was made sin for us, God, in judging Him as our Substitute, forsook Him economically&mdash;Mark 15:33-34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus was born of the begetting Spirit as the divine essence, who never left Him essentially&mdash;Luke 1:35.</li>
		<li>When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross under God&rsquo;s judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being; nevertheless, He was forsaken by the righteous and judging God economically&mdash;Matt. 1:18, 20; 27:46:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Because the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit and was born of God and with God, He had the Holy Spirit as the intrinsic essence of His divine being; thus, it was not possible for God to forsake Him essentially&mdash;1:18, 20.</li>
			<li>Christ was forsaken by God economically when the Spirit, who had descended upon Him as the economical power for the carrying out of His ministry (3:16), left Him; however, the essence of God remained in His being, and He therefore died on the cross as the God-man&mdash;1 John 1:7.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Slave-Savior&rsquo;s resurrection is proof that God is satisfied with what He accomplished through His death&mdash;Mark 16:1-6; Rom. 4:25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>His resurrection is a confirmation of the effectiveness of His redeeming and life-imparting death&mdash;Acts 2:24; 3:15.</li>
	<li>His resurrection became the evidence of our justification and the power by which we could be freed from sin&mdash;Rom. 4:25; 1 Cor. 15:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In a very real sense, the Gospel of Mark may be considered the Gospel of Peter (1 Pet. 5:13); therefore, we should consider Peter&rsquo;s words concerning Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, as recorded in the book of Acts:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In his first gospel message Peter testified that the crucified Jesus was raised up by God; since Christ is resurrection, it was impossible for Him to be held by death&mdash;Acts 2:24; John 11:25.</li>
	<li>The people had killed the One who is the Author of life, the origin and source of life, but God raised Him from the dead&mdash;Acts 3:15.</li>
	<li>The crucified Jesus has been raised from the dead to be the cornerstone of God&rsquo;s building; both our salvation and God&rsquo;s building are in the resurrected Christ&mdash;4:10-12.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus, the One in resurrection, has been exalted by God to be the Leader and our Savior&mdash;5:30-31.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Slave-Savior&rsquo;s ascension for His exaltation by God was a sign of God&rsquo;s acceptance of all He had done for God&rsquo;s eternal plan according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33-36:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In this exaltation God crowned Him with glory and honor, bestowed on Him the name that is above all names, and made Him the Lord of all and the Head over all things that He may have all authority in heaven and on earth to rule over the heavens, the earth, and the nations so that they can work together for the universal spreading of His gospel service&mdash;Heb. 2:9; Phil. 2:9; Acts 2:36; Eph. 1:22; Matt. 28:18.</li>
	<li>In order to experience Jesus as the Lord, the Christ, the Head of the church, the Head over all, and the One enthroned, crowned, and given the name above every name, we need to be in resurrection by being in the life-giving Spirit and living and walking by the Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; Gal. 5:16, 25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Gospel of Mark concludes with the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s universal spreading of the gospel through His disciples&mdash;16:15-16, 20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation&rdquo;&mdash;v. 15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s redemption is not only for man, the leading one in God&rsquo;s creation, but also for all the creation:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>All things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to (in) all creation under heaven&mdash;Col. 1:20, 23.</li>
			<li>All the creation expects to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God&mdash;Rom. 8:19-22.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Gospel of Mark reveals that we preach the gospel to make people of the old creation the members of the new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 16:16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To believe is to receive Christ for forgiveness of sins and for regeneration so that those who believe may become children of God and members of Christ in an organic union with the Triune God&mdash;John 1:12-13; 1 Pet. 1:21, 23; Eph. 5:30; Matt. 28:19.</li>
		<li>To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through Christ&rsquo;s death and by being raised up to be the new creation of God through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;Rom. 6:3-5; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		<li>Believing, by itself, is sufficient in order to receive salvation from condemnation; yet for the completion of one&rsquo;s inward salvation, believing needs baptism as an outward affirmation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word by the accompanying signs&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 16:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In 1:14-15 there was only one preacher of the gospel, but in 16:20 there are many preachers of the gospel, who are the reproduction of Christ in resurrection&mdash;John 12:24.</li>
		<li>This preaching of God&rsquo;s gospel to all the creation through Christ&rsquo;s believers began from Jerusalem and has been proceeding to the uttermost part of the earth continuously and universally through the past centuries, and will continue to proceed until the Lord comes to set up the kingdom of God on earth&mdash;Acts 1:8; Luke 19:12; Dan. 7:13-14.</li>
		<li>Now that we have seen the vision in the Gospel of Mark, let us go forth to preach Christ to all the creation; let us proclaim the gospel, present the truth, and minister life for the growth, development, and manifestation of the kingdom of God&mdash;Mark 16:15; Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:5; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 4:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
