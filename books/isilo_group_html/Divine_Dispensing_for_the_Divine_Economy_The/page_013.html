Christ is unsearchable, untraceable, unlimited, all-inclusive, and all-extensive. He is the breadth, length, height, and depth. These are the dimensions of the universe. No one can say how broad the breadth is, how long the length is, how high the height is, or how deep the depth is. All of these dimensions are Christ. As we allow Christ to get settled in our inner parts through the dispensing of His riches into us, gradually we will realize with all the saints that the Christ we enjoy is unsearchable, unlimited, all-inclusive, and all-extensive. We will apprehend with all the saints His breadth, length, height, and depth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Knowing the Knowledge-surpassing Love of Christ</H2><P>Christ making His home in our hearts causes us to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ (Eph. 3:19a). To know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ is to realize that Christ is everything to us. Christ is our breath, our rest, our daily life, and our home. He is also our drink, our food, our clothing, our wisdom, our knowledge, our sanctification, and our redemption. He is everything! As a result, His love is knowledge-surpassing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Being Filled unto All the Fullness of God<br>for the Corporate Expression<br>of the Processed Triune God</H2><P>When Christ is fully settled down within our hearts, we, the saints, are filled with the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God unto all the fullness of God for the corporate expression of the processed Triune God (Eph. 3:19b). This means that what God is becomes what we are. We are filled with the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God to such an extent that we are filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God. This fullness is the expression of God, and this expression is the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God.</P><P>Our eyes need to be enlightened to see the church according to God's high standard. Much of today's speaking about the church is too low. We need a vision to uplift our view and to rescue us from a low understanding concerning the church. We make mistakes which devastate the practical church life because our understanding is too low. We need to be rescued. This rescue comes from a proper view and an uplifted vision concerning the church, the Body of Christ, the organism of the Triune God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing for the Divine Economy &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
