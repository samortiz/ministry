<h2 class="head1">A MATTER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>This is a matter of life. It is the same in the physical life with your children. Little ones can do certain things when they are two years of age. When they become five years of age they can do something more. So there is the need of the measure of the stature in life. Don&rsquo;t imitate. If you are able to pray that much, just do it. But if you are not able to do it, spontaneously there is no need for me to say don&rsquo;t do it. You simply can&rsquo;t do it. To portray the real experience of Christ in our life is somewhat strange. The only thing that can help us to realize it is to get into that stage. When I get into a certain stage, I will spontaneously understand the life matters in that stage. When I get to another stage I will understand the matters of life in that stage. When we began this Perfecting Training we realized that many of you have been in the experience of Christ for years. We surely realized that many of you are bothered because your old way of experiencing Christ in the past no longer works. Why? It is because you have reached another stage. I don&rsquo;t mean that all of us have reached another stage. It is like a big family. There are folks of all ages. You don&rsquo;t need to imitate others. You are in one stage of life, and others are in different stages of life. In the church life we cannot have separate grades to form classes as in a school.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REAL BODY LIFE</h2>
<p>Gradually, I believe the Lord will speak to us more and more. Then perhaps we will go on to another matter. It may be that the Lord will lead us to the matter of the Body. Actually, not many even among us know what is the real Body life. Why? Because the life is not that much here. But the real Body life is much closer than it was years ago. So it may be that we will turn eventually from the experience of Christ to the real Body life. We look to the Lord that He would surely lead us on. I believe many of you realize that in these few months what we have covered is higher, not in knowledge or doctrine, but in our practical experience of Christ in life.</p>
