        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LAW OF THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:17-48</h1>
<p>In this chapter we come to the third section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, which concerns the law of the kingdom people. Because this section is at the center of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching, the Lord spoke at length concerning the law of the kingdom people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>First, we need to consider the meaning and significance of the law. Upon hearing the word <em>law,</em> many saints immediately say, &ldquo;The law is a demand, a bondage, that requires us to do what we cannot do and to behave in ways that we cannot behave. Those who are under the law are cursed; however, we are no longer under the law but under grace. We have nothing to do with the law.&rdquo; Although this word has a basis in the Scriptures, there is a positive aspect as well as a negative aspect to the significance of the law.</p>
<p>Apparently, the law speaks only of demands. However, the law speaks of demands because the law represents authority. If there were no authority, there would be no demands. Demands come from authority. Therefore, demands are based on authority.</p>
<p>Every country has its laws. Furthermore, every citizen in a country must keep the regulations of the law and meet the demands of the law, because every country has authority. The setting of the law is authority. A country has authority over its citizens. Therefore, a country can demand its citizens to keep its laws. In a family parents can make demands on their children, because parents have authority. A person who is unrelated to you is not qualified to demand anything of you, because he has no authority over you. However, our parents can ask us to do things, they can forbid us from doing things, and they can even punish us, because our parents have authority over us. Similarly, God has given us the law, and He can make demands on us because He has authority over us. The law is the embodiment of God&rsquo;s authority. God&rsquo;s authority rests with the law. If God&rsquo;s law and its demands were set aside, God&rsquo;s authority would become empty and vague. It is impossible for someone who has not accepted God&rsquo;s law or who has not met the demands of God&rsquo;s law to be under God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>Many saints have only a negative understanding of the law. As soon as they hear the word <em>law,</em> they think that it refers to an unattainable demand and that the law is in some way annulled. Such a concept is inaccurate. Is it improper for God to require us to not worship idols or to not serve other gods? Is it wrong for Him to require us to honor our parents? Is God wrong in forbidding us to kill, commit adultery, or steal? These requirements are proper and right. Hence, Romans 7:12 says, &ldquo;The law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, although the law can demand that man do good, the law does not supply man with life or with the ability to do good (Gal. 3:12). Romans 8:3 speaks of &ldquo;that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh.&rdquo; Out of the works of the law no flesh can be justified before God (3:20). Hebrews 7:19 even says that the law perfected nothing. Although man cannot keep the law by his own effort, he does not know his condition nor does he trust in God&rsquo;s grace. Instead, man seeks to establish his own righteousness (Rom. 10:3). Herein lies man&rsquo;s failure.</p>
<p>Even though man failed, God did not annul His law. Because man cannot meet God&rsquo;s demand, God met His own demand through the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection and through His becoming man&rsquo;s life. This is the New Testament. The New Testament does not annul God&rsquo;s demand; rather, it adds God&rsquo;s supply. God did not annul the demand of the law, because His authority rests in the law. Throughout the generations God has desired to restore His authority, which is sustained by the law. Therefore, when the Old Testament age ended and the New Testament age began, that is, in the first book of the New Testament, the Lord spoke about the demand of the law when He preached the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>When the Lord preached the gospel, people heard the truth concerning the forgiveness of sins and concerning life. They also heard many gracious words from His mouth. With their own eyes they saw Him heal the sick, raise the dead, and perform many deeds of grace. They might have thought that the Lord Jesus was only being gracious to man, demanding nothing from man. However, when the Lord Jesus went up to the mountain with His disciples, He gave a lengthy teaching that began with demands, such as being poor in spirit, mourning, being meek, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, being merciful, being pure in heart, and being salt and light (5:1-8, 13-16). The disciples might have been perplexed because the Lord&rsquo;s tone on the mountain was different from His tone prior to going up the mountain. Before they went up the mountain, everything was grace and supply, but on the mountain there were only demands.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s teaching on the mountain is not different from the gospel of grace. There is no contradiction. Rather, the gospel of grace fulfills His teaching on the mountain. The Lord came to supply man and to give man grace so that man could be brought under the authority of the kingdom of the heavens and live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord became flesh and dwelt among men in order to establish this authority. Therefore, in the Gospel of Matthew the Lord spoke concerning the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 1-12), concerning their influence on the world (vv. 13-16), and concerning the demands of the law that the authority of the kingdom of the heavens has on us (vv. 17-48). When we accept these demands and meet these demands by life, we are under God&rsquo;s authority and are living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The third section of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning the reality of the kingdom of the heavens begins in verse 17, which says, &ldquo;Do not think that I have come to abolish the law.&rdquo; This means that we should not think that the Lord came to abolish the law. Such a thought is inaccurate. The Lord said, &ldquo;I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill&rdquo; (v. 17b). The Lord seemed to be saying that the Old Testament law made demands but that these demands were not perfect or complete. The Lord came to fulfill these demands in order to perfect and complete the law. The Old Testament law can be likened to a piece of light blue cloth. The Lord did not come to abolish the cloth but to deepen its color, that is, to make it deep blue.</p>
<p>In coming to the earth to give grace, the Lord did not annul authority, nor did He annul the demands of the law. Instead, He completed the demands of the law. A complete demand brings in a complete authority to the earth so that God can rule among men. The demand of the Old Testament was relative, but the demand of the kingdom of the heavens is absolute. The Lord did not come to lead people into keeping the Old Testament law. In fact, He said that the demands of the Old Testament law were not complete. Hence, He came to bring the kingdom of the heavens to man. Only the demand and authority of the kingdom of the heavens are complete and perfect.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:19 the Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; This verse indicates that how we practice the laws and the commandments determines our greatness in the kingdom of the heavens. If we practice the law and are under its authority, we have more of the element of the kingdom of the heavens in us and are greater in the kingdom of the heavens. If we do not practice the law and are not under its authority, we have less of the element of the kingdom of the heavens in us and are less in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In verse 20 the Lord said, &ldquo;I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Righteousness requires man to fulfill the demands of the law. God&rsquo;s demands are lawful, fair, and reasonable. If we meet these demands, we have righteousness before God. The scribes and Pharisees tried to meet the demands of the Old Testament law, but their righteousness would not have been complete even if they had been able to keep the law. The Lord came to fulfill the demands of the Old Testament law; hence, our righteousness should surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees. Their righteousness was a matter of fulfilling the incomplete demands of the Old Testament law, but our righteousness is a matter of fulfilling the complete demands of the kingdom of the heavens. The scribes and Pharisees sought for righteousness by fulfilling the law of letters through their own efforts. Our surpassing righteousness, however, comes from fulfilling the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens by God&rsquo;s life. We must have such a full and surpassing righteousness in order to live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today and in order to reign together with the Lord in the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>How do we know if we are living in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and are under the ruling of the authority of the kingdom of the heavens? Having this surpassing righteousness depends on meeting the Lord&rsquo;s fuller demands. The living of the people of the kingdom of the heavens is a matter of being ruled inwardly by the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord&rsquo;s word in this section describes the living of a person who is inwardly ruled by the kingdom of the heavens. The inward ruling is the basis for our outward living, and our outward living is a proof of the inward ruling. Our outward living manifests the inward condition of our living under the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:21 through 48 the Lord spoke in detail concerning the various demands of the kingdom of the heavens. This proves that the Lord came to complete the Old Testament demands. From these verses we have a picture of the living of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
