<h1 class="title">THE URGENT NEED OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT LACK OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Lord has shown us that there is the need to build the church. The present need of the church is not merely for the believers to love the Lord fervently, to pursue spirituality, or to preach the gospel zealously in order to lead people to salvation. Rather, the present need is for the believers to be built together in spirit to become a living, spiritual temple as the Body of Christ for Him to obtain rest, to be expressed, and to be glorified.</p>
<p>In 1958 we released a series of messages concerning the building (see the following three books: <em>The Building Work of God, The Basis for the Building Work of God,</em> and <em>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God</em>). The response of the saints to these messages was inadequate. However, there has been a strong response from the saints to the recent messages concerning the building of the church. This response has resulted in some amount of practical building in the church.</p>
<p>While pursuing the practical building, we discovered that there is a serious lack in spiritual riches among us. We still are lacking in matters related to the spirit, because we are short of genuine fellowship and prayer. In the spring of 1958 the leading brothers sensed this shortage. The brothers saw that many saints have a heart for the Lord and enjoy coming to the meetings and listening to messages but lack personal fellowship with the Lord. Therefore, we had three conferences to cover how to eat, drink, and enjoy God and how to absorb His riches through reading the Word and prayer (see <em>How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God</em>). The Lord spoke a fresh and timely word to us in those meetings, and a number of saints experienced a turn in their fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>However, there is still a great lack in the practical living of the saints in relation to the present need of God&rsquo;s building. We still do not have adequate fellowship with the Lord. The more we fellowship concerning the relationship between the saints who serve as priests and their being built up together, the more we sense this need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH AND<br />
OUR SERVING AS PRIESTS</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:5 says, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; The spiritual house is produced through the living stones being built up together. This house is a priesthood, a group of built-up priests. Therefore, for the saints to be built up together, they must be priests. The priests who serve God, draw near to Him, and fellowship with Him are the spiritual house, the dwelling place of God.</p>
<p>In both Exodus and Leviticus the priests&rsquo; service was related always to the tabernacle; the tabernacle was entrusted to their care. In the picture of the Old Testament typology, the priests were the serving ones, and the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The priests and the tabernacle were distinct but not separate from each other. When the tabernacle was pitched, the priests served God in the tabernacle. When the children of Israel moved, the tabernacle was entrusted to the priests. Among the children of Israel, there was always a corporate body of priests caring for the tabernacle. The tabernacle and the priests could not be separated.</p>
<p>In the New Testament 1 Peter 2 speaks concerning the priests and the tabernacle being mingled as one. Verse 5 says that the priesthood is the spiritual house. The New Testament priests are the New Testament tabernacle. Every priest is a constituent of the tabernacle. Every saint must be a living priest in order for us to be built up together as the church. A saint who lacks fellowship with the Lord and the flow of living water cannot be considered a living stone, nor is there the possibility for him to be built with others. Therefore, we must bring the saints into the priestly service for them to live a life in the Holy of Holies, that is, to live continuously before God and in fellowship with Him. This is the only way that we can be built up together.</p>
<p>Apart from being brought into the priesthood, there is no other way for the children of God to be built together. It is not sufficient for us to nurture and edify the saints. The saints must be brought into the priestly living so that they may serve in the tabernacle, that is, live before God and let God live in them. Then their spirit will be fresh, and they will grow daily and be able to be blended and built up together. To be blended in spirit is to be built up. We cannot be built up in ourselves; we can be built up only in the Spirit.</p>
<p>With respect to the Body of Christ, on the one hand, we have been baptized in the Spirit, and on the other hand, we have been given to drink the Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; This means that we are baptized in the Spirit outwardly and that we drink the Spirit inwardly. These are the two aspects of our experience of the Spirit. We experience His outpouring and His infilling. With respect to the outpouring, we are baptized in Him; with respect to the infilling, we drink Him. If we are in the Spirit and let the Spirit blend us together, we will experience the one Body. This is real coordination, blending, and building. We must see that unless the saints are brought into the priestly service, there is no way for the church to be built.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Spirit and the Building of God &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
