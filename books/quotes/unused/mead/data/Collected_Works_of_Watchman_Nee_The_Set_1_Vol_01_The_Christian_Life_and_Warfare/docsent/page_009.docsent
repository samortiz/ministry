   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT, THE SOUL, AND THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most people today consider man as being divided into two parts: the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that the soul is the invisible part, the psychological part within man, and that the body is the visible part, the outward form of man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, it is true that the body is the outward shell of man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But it is a question whether or not the soul is a substance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are the soul and the spirit one thing, or are they two things?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is the soul equal to the spirit, or are the two different?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man's answer is that they are the same thing that other than a difference in terminology, the two are identical in substance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Man's answer, however, is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must take a look at the Bible, the trustworthy Word of God, in order to find out the answer to this question.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Word of God does not divide man into two parts, the soul and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, it divides man into three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "Sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse clearly shows a distinction between the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Otherwise, it would not have said, "Your spirit and soul," but rather, "Your spirit-soul."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since God has said this, we can see that there is a distinction between man's spirit and his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From this we can conclude that man is divided into three parts the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the significance of distinguishing the spirit from the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It has much to do with the spiritual life of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If believers do not know the boundary of their spirit, how can they understand the spiritual life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they do not understand the spiritual life, how can they have a spiritual living?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is because believers are negligent or ignorant of the distinction between the spirit and the soul that they never grow in their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only has 1 Thessalonians divided man into three parts, other passages in the Scriptures do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here again, man is divided into three parts: the soul, the spirit, and the joints and marrow which refer to the organ related to the mind and the will , that is, the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the soul and the spirit can be divided, the two must not be the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE CREATED MAN</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"The dust of the ground" refers to man's body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"The breath of life" breathed into man's nostrils is his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"A living soul" is man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, a complete man is composed of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the above verse, the soul came into being when the spirit was joined to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the spirit entered the body, the soul was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The body was dead, but when it was contacted by the spirit of life, a third entity was produced the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the spirit, the body is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only with the spirit can one live.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the spirit is in the body, something organic is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This organic result is called the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's breath of life is the source of man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus said, "It is the Spirit who gives life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the breath of life that gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, this breath is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the spirit and the body join together, the result is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Scripture says, "And man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that when Adam's spirit and body were joined together, a third part was produced, the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His spirit and body were both joined to this third part, to his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why the Word of God calls it "a living soul" 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we believers participate in the resurrection life of the Lord, the spirit begins to rule over our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is because those who have believed in the Lord are joined to the last Adam, who is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
