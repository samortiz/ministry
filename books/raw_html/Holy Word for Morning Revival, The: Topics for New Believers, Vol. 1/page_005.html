<p class="bold">WEEK 1 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">John 10:28 &nbsp;And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</p><p class="bold">6:37 &nbsp;All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out.</p><h2 class="head1">By God’s Eternal Life</h2><p>In John 10:28 the Lord said, “And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever.” Eternal life is God’s life. The Lord has given this life to us and has brought us into an eternal relationship with God, a relationship in life, so that we can never be separated from Him. Today, God’s eternal life in us maintains the eternal security of our salvation so that we shall never perish.</p><h2 class="head1">By God’s New Covenant</h2><p>Our salvation is secured by the new covenant which God made with us (Heb. 8:8-12). This covenant was consummated through the redemption accomplished by the shedding of the blood of the Lord Jesus (Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20). According to this covenant, God will forgive the sins of all those who believe in the Lord Jesus and will not remember their iniquities any longer; He will impart His laws into their mind and inscribe them on their hearts; He will be God to them and they will be a people to Him; and they all will know God and will not need others to teach them. At the same time, this covenant is an eternal covenant (Heb. 13:20), which will remain eternally and is effective eternally. Furthermore, because God is faithful and is One who keeps His covenant (Deut. 7:9), He will never break His covenant (Psa. 89:34) but will fulfill it in us accordingly. Hence, His covenant, which cannot be annulled, guarantees the eternal security of our salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">By Christ’s Perfect, Complete, and Eternal Redemption</h2><p>Our salvation is also secured by Christ’s eternal redemption, which is perfect and complete. Hebrews 10:14 says, “For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.” By offering Himself on the cross without blemish as the one sacrifice to God, Christ has accomplished an eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12; 10:10, 12). Hence, this redemption is eternally perfect and complete, without any blemish or shortcoming. Through Christ’s eternal redemption we, the sanctified ones, have been perfected eternally. No one can condemn us any longer (Rom. 8:34), nor can anyone nullify the perfect, complete, and eternal redemption which Christ has accomplished for us.</p><h2 class="head1">By Christ’s Eternal Salvation</h2><p>We are saved with security by Christ’s eternal salvation. Hebrews 5:9 says that Christ “became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation.” The salvation brought to us by Christ is an eternal salvation, all the effects, benefits, and issues of which are of an eternal nature, transcending the limitations of time. Our salvation, therefore, is eternally secure.</p><h2 class="head1">By Christ’s Almighty Hand</h2><p>Just as God’s almighty hand is powerful, so also Christ’s almighty hand is strong [John 10:28]. Both are safeguards to our salvation. Eternal life shall never run out, and the hands of the Son and the Father shall never fail. Therefore, our salvation is eternally secure, and we shall never perish.</p><h2 class="head1">By Christ’s Unfailing Promise</h2><p>[In] John 6:37…the Lord has promised that He will never cast out those who come to Him. Such a promise guarantees the eternal security of our salvation. Therefore, God has shown us in His Word from different angles that once we are saved, we are eternally saved, we are eternally perfected, we shall by no means perish eternally, and we are eternally secure.<sup>23</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
