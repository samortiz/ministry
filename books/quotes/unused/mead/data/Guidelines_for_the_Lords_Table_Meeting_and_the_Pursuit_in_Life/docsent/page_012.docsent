   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Principle in Selecting Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hymns are for the expression of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot sing a hymn that expresses a certain feeling if we do not have one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should find a hymn that best expresses our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, we must learn how to select hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that when we touch a certain atmosphere, according to the prevailing feeling in the meeting, we should select a hymn from the hymnal that expresses that feeling best.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we choose a hymn in this way, the feeling will be expressed and will flow out through the singing of the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the principle of selecting hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sensing the Feeling of Those Who Are Singing</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When selecting a hymn, we need to sense the feeling of the saints when they are singing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose there is a general feeling of insipidness in a meeting; if a hymn is selected that is very solemn, no one will be able to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Someone may select Hymns, #240, Glory, honor, praise and power, / Be unto the Lamb forever!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In such a meeting, no one will be able to sing with any feeling of glory or honor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, it would not be appropriate for us to select a hymn asking the Lord to reveal Himself if there is a need for a hymn on the confession of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When people are sad, we should choose hymns of sorrow; when people are joyful, we should choose hymns of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Selecting Hymns to Strengthen the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not easy to select hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Often our meetings are not strong because our feeling is not keen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some brothers have fellowshipped that the meetings in their localities are not strong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would ask, If our feeling is not keen, how can the meetings be strong?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to our observation, we sense that the meetings are not satisfactory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we urgently need to be trained in these three matters: first, how to work; second, how to lead; and third, how to manage.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Leading the meetings is not the responsibility of the elders and deacons only; it is the responsibility of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we have an obligation to learn to select hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are unable to select appropriate hymns, how can we have good meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although there may be no particular feeling at the beginning of a fellowship meeting, the principle for selecting hymns still applies.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consider hymn #128 in the Chinese hymnal, I prostrate, Lord, before Thee, / Marvel at boundless grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This hymn expresses the feeling of a person who has been touched by the Lord s love and feels that he is loved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By singing this hymn of love, he is able to express all of his feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, because this is a specific hymn, it should not be called at the beginning of a fellowship meeting, a meeting without a particular feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The principle of choosing hymns is that we should choose a hymn according to the feeling we sense in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In a general fellowship meeting, it is good to select hymn #352 in the Chinese hymnal, Though we waver as the seasons, / He will every change endure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our inspiration to select this hymn indicates that we feel the Lord is dear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we sing this hymn, a feeling for the Lord replaces our indifference.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After singing, we should follow with a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may pray, O Lord, we were so indifferent when we came before You, yet Your love toward us has never changed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we sing this hymn and pray in this way, the hearts of the brothers and sisters will be brought to a state where they have a feeling for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The meeting will then have a center, a subject, which is the Lord s dearness to us and His love for us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we can lead the meeting to this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Selecting an Introductory Hymn</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us consider selecting an introductory hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even though Hymns, #544, Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine, is a good hymn, after singing it we will not be left with a strong feeling because this hymn does not touch the Lord s love but touches our lack of love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hymns, #368, More love to Thee, O Lord, is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, Hymns, #286, Of Jesus love that sought me, is very good as a continuation of the opening hymn, hymn #352 in the Chinese hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hymns, #286 speaks of Jesus love that is far deeper than the sea ; the chorus also speaks of Jesus love.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, it conveniently leads us to the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hymns, #956, Soon our Lord will come, the day is drawing nigh, causes us to consider the Lord Jesus coming and therefore is not appropriate for leading the meeting to the subject of the Lord s love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have said repeatedly that selecting hymns is a matter of feeling; hence, we need to touch the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are indifferent when we come together for a fellowship meeting, there is a need for someone to touch a particular feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If this feeling is touched, we will be able to choose the most suitable hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For instance, we may select hymn #352 in the Chinese hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we sing this hymn, the more we will feel that even though we are cold toward the Lord, He is never cold toward us; that even though our heart may often change, His love will never depart; and that even though we do not care for the Lord, He cares very much for us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After we sing this hymn with such feeling, we should immediately follow with a prayer, thanking the Lord for His unchanging love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way, our hearts will be stirred up to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord has never changed toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although we may feel indifferent when we came into the meeting, through singing and prayer and the introductory hymn, Hymns, #286, the feeling of the Lord s love being far deeper than the sea will be stirred up within us, and we will be led to the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Understanding the Purpose of Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In order to select hymns, we must first know the purpose of hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Why do we need to sing hymns in a meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The hymns that the brothers and sisters typically select show that we do not know the purpose of selecting hymns, and we do not know that a hymn is a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A poem is for the expression of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Chinese say that a poem is an inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A poem is different than an essay.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whereas an essay may be written according to a train of thought, a poem requires inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be inspired is to be aroused with a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must be touched before we can write a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Without any feeling, there will be no poem.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A poem, a hymn, is the expression of our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we come together to choose hymns, we must hold firmly to this secret.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is always an atmosphere when the saints gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to learn to sense the atmosphere, the feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we touch the atmosphere, the feeling, we can select an appropriate hymn from our memory that matches the feeling we sense.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At the end of a meeting, if we sense that the feeling of the brothers and sisters is that the Lord Jesus is exalted, we should sing All in all forever, / Only Christ I ll sing Hymns, #513, chorus .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This hymn can express the feeling of the brothers and sisters exaltation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since a hymn is for the expression of feelings, we must touch the feeling of the ones who are singing when we select a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If a hymn matches the feeling of those who are singing, they will be released and will express their inner feeling through the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, we must be familiar with the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must ask, What is the feeling of this particular hymn?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Is the feeling adequately conveyed?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to be familiar with these points; then when we touch a certain feeling in a meeting, we will be able to select a hymn from our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then everyone s feeling will be expressed through the singing.</S>
