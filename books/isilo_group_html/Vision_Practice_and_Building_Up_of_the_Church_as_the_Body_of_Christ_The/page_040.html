on the Proper Ground of Oneness</h2>
<p>Recently a brother spoke with me concerning prophecy and the world situation, telling me how he felt that the end of time is very near. The end may be near, but it may not be as near as some think. In 1936, when Mussolini was in power, the great Bible teacher D. M. Panton published the pictures of Mussolini and Caesar Nero side by side, saying that Mussolini was the Antichrist and that this was a strong sign that the time for the Lord&rsquo;s coming was near. At that time I was working in Tientsin, the biggest seaport in northern China, close to the capital of Peking. After reading Mr. Panton&rsquo;s paper, I had the definite understanding that it was not accurate. My feeling was confirmed simply by considering the condition of the building up of the church. Christ will return as the Bridegroom, but a bridegroom comes for a bride. Where today is the real building up of the church as the bride of Christ?</p>
<p>Some may ask how it is possible to be identified in oneness with all the members of the Body of Christ. In order to answer this, let us consider the picture, the type, of the people of Israel. At the time of Solomon when the temple was first built, all of God&rsquo;s people were in the same place and on the same ground. At that time it was possible and even easy to identify with all of God&rsquo;s people. Later, some of God&rsquo;s people were captured away to Egypt, some to Syria, and some to Persia, while most of them were taken away to Babylon. Under this dispersion it was no longer possible to be identified with all the people of God. If someone was identified with the group in Egypt, he was separated from all the other groups. To identify with even the biggest group, the one in Babylon, was to not be identified with the rest of the people of God. We should not ask how it is possible to be identified with all of God&rsquo;s people. Under the present dispersion, in the time of captivity, it is not a matter of choosing with whom we identify ourselves. What matters is that we receive the command of God to come back to the very place appointed and ordained by God. We must come back to Jerusalem, as Ezra and Nehemiah did. Those who came back to Jerusalem with Ezra and Nehemiah to stand on the proper ground of the temple became a living testimony. They became the building of God in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It was not a large number of the captives who came back, perhaps not even ten percent. In the same way, there is no doubt that the Lord spoke to all the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, but His concern was to gain the overcomers. In this age of degradation what matters is not how many of the Lord&rsquo;s people we seem to identify with. What matters is that we take the standing that the Lord commands.</p>
<p>After the day of Pentecost there was no need for those in Jerusalem to take a standing with a particular people of God. All the believers were identified with one another simply because they were all in one place, standing on one ground. Later, however, the church was divided. Consider the situation of division today. There are some living members of the Body even in the Catholic Church, but this does not mean that we should go to the Catholic Church to identify ourselves with these members. In the degradation, captivity, and dispersion today, it is not a matter of choosing with whom we identify ourselves. It is a matter of coming to the proper ground to take the stand that God ordains.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for a Remnant<br />
to Go Outside the Camp unto Christ</h2>
<p>Today God needs a remnant, a small group of overcomers to take the stand that was lost by the whole church. For this reason we need to see a vision and not simply consider the situation according to our natural and religious concept. We need to see something according to God&rsquo;s eternal plan. We may compare the situation today to the smog in Los Angeles. Many days it is difficult to see the mountains through the smog. Under the smog everyone&rsquo;s vision is veiled. We need to be transcendent, to rise above the smoggy air. Then we will see the vision.</p>
<p>Today some are still considering how to identify themselves with all the members of the Body. If they try to do this, they will not succeed. This is not the nature of the present age. The age today is a time for some overcomers to listen to the voice of the rejected Lord, the One who is outside the camp (Heb. 13:13). There is no need to try to &ldquo;identify&rdquo; with the ones still in the camp. Rather, come out of the camp and go unto the Lord to follow Him and accomplish His purpose. We could never be more inclusive than the Lord is. The Lord Himself went out of the camp. We must go along not with the religious concept and the human thought but with the heavenly vision. Go outside the camp unto Him.</p>
<p>May the Lord be merciful to us. We need a vision. The Lord can testify that I am grateful to Him for the evangelistic ministry in America today. Thousands of people have been brought to the Lord, yet I am not satisfied only to see that thousands of lost souls are saved. I desire to see even only a small number of them listen to the Lord&rsquo;s voice, go unto Him, and be built up together as a living testimony. These will be the bride of Christ mentioned in Revelation 19:7-8, the overcomers, not simply the wife of the Lamb in eternity mentioned in 21:2 and 9.</p>
<p>We need to see the vision and not merely have a general concept. Regardless of how people condemn and criticize us, we should disregard their speaking. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was always criticized by the religious people, by those who had the Scriptures in their hands. He was also crucified by those people according to their understanding of the Scriptures. We should not be affected by all the criticisms. We need the vision of God&rsquo;s building. Without a vision, all the things we have spoken here are in vain. Once we have the vision, everything is different; the whole universe is changed. I am limited in my ability to speak these things, but I trust in the Lord according to my prayer that what I have spoken here is not my own word but the revealing Spirit unveiling the vision of God&rsquo;s building. The Holy Spirit will unveil these things to you so that you may see the vision of the building. There is no other vision in the Bible. All the visions in the Bible are for the building, which is the very aim of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Practice, and Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
