   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Body of Christ, the Fullness of the One Who Fills All in All, for His Expression</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The universal church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 1:22 and 23 reveal that the church as the Body is "the fullness of the One who fills all in all."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Body of Christ is His fullness, that is, His full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Body is the fullness of the Head, and the fullness is the expression of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ, who is the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a great Christ needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 Constituted of All the Believers Baptized in One Spirit and Given to Drink One Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First Corinthians 12:12 and 13 say, "Even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ; for also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These verses reveal that the church as the Body of Christ is constituted of all the believers baptized in one Spirit and given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, Christ breathed the Spirit into the disciples and then baptized them in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now all the believers, as constituents of the Body, have been given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the Breather of the Spirit, the Baptizer in the Spirit, and the Giver of the Spirit as our constant drink.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the biblical principle, our spiritual food is in this drink, in this water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Revelation 22 we see that the tree of life grows in the river.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, when we drink of the river of water of life we receive not only the water but also the nourishment from the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Breather, Christ breathed Himself as the essential Spirit into us to be the essence of our spiritual being and existence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, with this as the basis, He baptized us all into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now He continually gives the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"He gives the Spirit not by measure" John 3:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>2 Constituted with the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church as the Body of Christ is constituted with the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the riches of Christ are for the producing of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This takes place through the dispensing of these riches into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The experience of the riches of Christ results in the fullness of Christ, the Body, as Christ's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the Body of Christ is constituted of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the riches of Christ are experienced and enjoyed by us, they become the fullness of Christ, the Body, for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is the fullness of God, and the church is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ's riches are so extensive that not only is Christ Himself filled with them, but these riches also fill up the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we are filled with Christ's riches, we become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is what it means to say that the universal church as the Body of Christ is constituted with the unsearchable riches of Christ. c.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Wife of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church is also the wife of Christ, His counterpart Eph 5:23-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church as the counterpart of Christ implies satisfaction and rest in love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ needs such a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be the church is to render to Christ the adequate satisfaction and rest in love.</S>
