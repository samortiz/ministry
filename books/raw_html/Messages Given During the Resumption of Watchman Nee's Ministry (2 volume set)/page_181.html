<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CO-WORKERS' MEETING (15)</H1><P>Date:6:30 p.m., Wednesday, April 21, 1948<br>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br>Nature:Testimonies by the co-workers, and exhortations<br>by Witness Lee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TESTIMONIES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Riches Frustrating a Person<br>from Becoming a Proper Christian</H2><P>Brother Hsu Yung-ming from Hangchow: If we do not take the first step now, we will have no spiritual future. I am willing to hand over all that I have in my hands. I do not have to grit my teeth to take such a step. In order to be a proper Christian, I have to take the way of poverty. If I am rich, I cannot be a good Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Thoroughly Handing Oneself Over</H2><P>Brother Chan Kwang-hsien from Hangchow testified: Those who are entangled with affairs cannot serve the Lord. We are the Lord's soldiers, and we are trained daily for the purpose of going to war. During the past two years, I saw in Romans 12 that it is a reasonable thing for us to offer ourselves as a living sacrifice. If we do not obey the Lord, we will be in trouble. If salt loses its taste, it will become useless. If we do not hand ourselves over to the Lord in a thorough way, what we do will amount to nothing. Everything belongs to the Lord, and everything of the Lord is ours. We can never be separated from Him. If I do not follow the Lord, I will remain in the world, and in the world there is only darkness. Even when we make some money, we will not have peace, and we will not be able to sleep well. May the Lord remove our foolishness. He is the One who abides forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Handing Over One's Riches to Become Free</H2><P>Brother Chang Yu-lan from Nanking testified: I am quite old already, and I have been saved seven years. In the past, through my work in scientific research, my two eyes were damaged by an explosion. After I prayed, the Lord recovered one of my eyes, which can now see clearly. I have three shortcomings. The first is that I am short in consecration. Consecration requires concrete expressions. Without concrete expressions, it is not enough just to have the heart. Now, everyone is handing over themselves with a consecration slip. I must therefore hand myself over also. Second, I have been a major general for twenty years, and all the officers have been very good to me. It is difficult to cut off this relationship. Third, there is the problem of serving mammon. Mammon has put my body and soul under bondage. I can have twenty million dollars with me, but what good does that do if my mind is in bondage? If I cannot get through in this matter, money will still exercise its influence on me. If I hand over my wealth and I die, everything will be over. But to be a living sacrifice is more troublesome, because I still have to live. I am willing to hand over everything I have to the apostles, and I am willing to be without any opinion. When I hand myself over, I become free. Many people have died in the hands of the Communists; their goods were confiscated. It is better that I consecrate everything to the Lord instead.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee laid hands on him and prayed for him: Lord, gain our brother within and without. Your works are eternal works. May You work more and more in our brother, that his spirit will become stronger and stronger, that his eyes will become brighter and brighter. This is the Body's prayer, and we believe that the Head affirms it. May those who touch him see light daily, and may he be able to send others away in blessings. Accomplish for him what he purposes in his heart. Prepare for him a job that exceeds all that we ask or think. May You cover him much with Your blood for Your testimony's sake. Strengthen our brother's inner man, until the day we see You.</P><P>Brother Hsia Wen-tsao testified: In the past, I was always bound. Two years ago today, I had a thousand mou [Chinese acre] of land and a fabric store. Although I was strong outwardly, I was weak inwardly. Today, all these things are gone. I should have consecrated everything then, and I would have saved so many souls. Today, if we do not give ourselves to the Lord, Satan will not let us go; he will try to gain us.</P>
