The prophets in the Old Testament, in foretelling the coming of Christ, thought that He would have only one coming. But actually, there are two comings of Christ. Moreover, these two comings are separated by at least two thousand years. This is like two peaks of a mountain. When looking from afar, they seem to be joined together, one stacked in front of the other. When we read these prophecies now, we know that the Lord's coming is at two times. Moreover, the second coming of Christ will not be as soon as the apostles thought.</P><P>Some may wonder why the Lord's return is not yet fulfilled now that the two thousand years have nearly passed. Did not the Lord say at the end of the Bible, at the conclusion of Revelation 22, that He would come quickly? We should not forget that to the Lord, a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). To the eternal Lord God, time is not a factor. In fulfilling the promise of His return, what is important is not time, but the facts. Today, as I stand before you, I can say with assurance that the time of waiting will not be very long, because from the various prophecies of the Bible, and in comparing these prophecies with the present world situation, we can see that the Lord's coming is near.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of the Divine Dispensing and Guidelines for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
