   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>These experiences show us the importance of receiving "utterance" from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are two kinds of utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first is our natural utterance, and the other is given to our spirit by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The utterance mentioned in Acts 2:4 is indispensable in spiritual works.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No matter how good our natural eloquence is, it cannot speak forth the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even when we feel that we have expressed everything well, we still may not have conveyed the intention of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only spiritual words those which we receive in our spirit can relate spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes we have the Lord's message in our spirit; it seems to be compelling and burning us, and we feel that there is a spiritual burden pressing on us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet we have no way of discharging it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At these times we have to wait for the Holy Spirit to grant us the "utterance," so that we can speak forth the message in our spirit and discharge the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not receive the utterance from the Holy Spirit through our intuition, but instead replace it with the words of man's wisdom, all spiritual value will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All these words only make people feel that our ideas are good.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes we have many spiritual experiences, but we do not know how to express them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, one short remark by another believer often clears away our clouds, enabling us to know the significance of a past experience which was hidden from us because the Lord had not yet instructed us in our spirit with a clear word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But someone can, with the simplest of words, open up our past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Spiritual things" must be explained by "spiritual words."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must use spiritual means to achieve spiritual goals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what the Lord is diligently teaching us these days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not enough for the goal to be spiritual; the means and procedures must also be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever is fleshly, no matter what it is, cannot fulfill what is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we try to use our mind and emotion to fulfill a spiritual goal, it is just like hoping that a bitter fountain will yield sweet water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything related to our fellowship with God, whether seeking His will, obeying His charge, or preaching His message, will only be useful if we do it in our intuition and in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we use our own mind, talent, and methods, it will be dead in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is a small note in the Chinese Union Version Bible, recommending that these last two phrases in verse 13 be translated as, "communicating spiritual things to spiritual men."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is very meaningful and relates to the next verse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us study this together with the next verse.</S>
