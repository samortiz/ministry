<h2 class="head2">To Know Christ, the Power of His Resurrection,<br />
and the Fellowship of His Sufferings</h2>
<p>Verses 10-11 say, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.&rdquo; To know Christ here is by experience&mdash;to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. The power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is His resurrection life which raised Him from among the dead. The fellowship of His sufferings is the participation in Christ&rsquo;s sufferings by being conformed to His death. The result of this experience is that we attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead, the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Transfiguration of Our Body</h2>
<p>Philippians 3:21 speaks of the transfiguration of our body, the conformation of our body to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. The transfiguration of our body is the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). This is the conformation of our body to the form of the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. In chapter one to experience Christ is a matter of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. No doubt, this is a matter in our spirit. In chapter two to experience Christ is a matter in our mind. Our mind should be indwelt by Christ&rsquo;s mind. Murmurings and especially reasonings are a matter of the mind. To think the same thing in 2:2 is also a matter in the mind. In chapter three to experience Christ in the final stage is to experience Him in our body. When we experience Him in our body, that will be the consummation of the experience of Christ, the transfiguration, the redemption of our body. This will be the conformation of our natural body to the heavenly form of the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. Our entire being will be brought into glory by experiencing Christ. Philippians 1 through 3 reveals our progressive experience of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Life Full of Forbearance but without Anxiety</h2>
<p>Philippians 4:5 and 6 say, &ldquo;Let your forbearance be known to all men. The Lord is near. In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.&rdquo; Near in verse 5 means near in space and time. Spacewise, the Lord is nigh to us, ready to help. Timewise, the Lord is at hand, coming soon. The forbearance mentioned in 4:5 is not an ordinary forbearance or an ethical forbearance. It is the forbearance of Christ, the spiritual attribute or virtue of Christ. If we exercise such forbearance, we shall not be anxious. A life full of forbearance but without anxiety was the subject of messages 56 through 62 of the Life-study of Philippians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Empowering of Christ</h2>
<p>Philippians 4:8 says, &ldquo;For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is righteous, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.&rdquo; The first six items in verse 8 are summed up in virtue and praise. Virtue and praise are the totality, the result, and issue of these six foregoing things. In verse 13 Paul says, &ldquo;I can do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; &ldquo;All things&rdquo; does not refer to healing the sick, raising the dead, or performing certain miracles. However, this is the thought of many Christians. Perhaps some from a Pentecostal background would apply verse 13 to the performing of certain miracles. &ldquo;All things&rdquo; in verse 13 refers to the all things mentioned in verse 12 and the virtues listed in verse 8. The application of verse 13 is limited by the context of verses 8 through 13. By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life (vv. 11-12) and be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of.</p>
<p>If you put all the points from these four chapters together you will see something very meaningful. First we experience Christ in our spirit by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in our spirit. Then we experience Christ in our mind by letting Christ&rsquo;s mind indwell our mind and do the transforming work. This saves us primarily from murmurings and reasonings. Third, we experience Christ consummately in chapter three in that our body will be transfigured, conformed to the glorious form of His body. Eventually, we are persons in Christ who empowers us to live out every kind of virtue. This is to live Christ, to magnify Christ in His virtues.</p>
<p>The six virtues mentioned in verse 8 are actually the image of God. God created man in His image, that is, in His attributes. The law came to describe what kind of God He is and to show us the main attributes of God. God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. These four things are God&rsquo;s attributes which constitute the image of God. That man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. These six items, whatever is true, honorable, pure, righteous, lovely, and reputable or well-spoken of, are in those four divine attributes of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. This is the real virtue, and this is the praise which is the very expression of our processed Triune God. This is to live Christ and this is to magnify Christ.</p>
