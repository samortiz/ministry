   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION NOT BEING FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE WORKS OF LAW</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first question is whether man is saved through faith with the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man's way for salvation is faith plus the keeping of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have spoken concerning the question of the law already, but we will repeat it again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible devotes much time to deal with this question.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Preachers, therefore, must also devote much time to deal with this question.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because man pays so much attention to the law, the Bible devotes two books to deal with this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to know for what purpose God has given the law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God gave the Israelites the law, not for them to keep, but for exposing their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Originally, the Israelites had sins, but they had not become transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From Adam to Moses, man had sins Rom 5:14 , but he did not have any transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God gave the law in order to turn man's sins into transgressions Rom 5:13, 20a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How were man's sins turned into transgressions?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose there is a person who has the disposition and temperament of walking back and forth outside the meeting hall every day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is something that he likes to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has to do this every day, every week, every month, and every year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one can explain why he does this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But in his temperament, disposition, and life, there is something that compels him to walk back and forth outside the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although he has such a habit, we cannot say that he has any transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may not like what he does, and you may think that it is wrong, but he has no realization that this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When will he realize that it is wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose you take two bright red ribbons and tie one to each end of the lane.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he comes the next day, he will see the two ribbons and will realize that he should not walk through them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His habit has always been to walk there because something in him compels him to walk there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Suppose he takes a look at the two ribbons and considers the bright color, the silk texture, the nice knots, and then tears them apart and walks right through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In that case, his walking is different from his previous walking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His previous walking was sin without transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now it is the same walking, but he walks in transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God says that the law is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is good, righteous, holy, and excellent Rom 7:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But man is full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is full of sin within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, from Adam to Moses, man had no transgressions although he had sin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God established the law, not in order that man would not sin, but in order to expose man's sins and make them transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today the law is here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once a person breaks the law, he realizes that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we can say that God gave man the law not for him to keep, but for him to see that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When there was no law, he did not realize that he has sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now he knows.</S>
