   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRYSTALLIZATION-STUDY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Epistle of James Message Three The Mistake of James Scripture Reading: James 1:18, 25; 2:8, 10-12; 4:11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that James made the great mistake of uplifting the Old Testament law of letters, but his mistake is covered by a beautiful cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>James treasured the law of letters through Moses, and he seemingly mentioned another law which he called the perfect law of freedom James 1:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past we thought that this perfect law of freedom was the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But actually, the words perfect and freedom are the top cloak to cover James's mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jeremiah prophesied concerning the law of life which would be written in our hearts Jer 31:31-34 , and Paul spoke of the law of the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In our crystallization-study to get into the intrinsic significance of the Bible, we now realize that James was not speaking of the law of life but of the law of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>JAMES'S BEAUTIFUL PORTRAIT OF THE MOSAIC LAW</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>James seemingly talks about three kinds of laws: the law of letters the Mosaic law , the royal law, and the law of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>James 2:8 says, "If indeed you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself,' you do well."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>James appreciated the law so much that he called it "the royal law."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Psalms 1, 19, and 119 uplift the law to the uttermost, but even the psalmist in those three psalms did not appreciate the law as highly as James did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>James 2:10 and 11 say, "For whoever keeps the whole law yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No doubt, when James refers to the law in verses 10 and 11 he is speaking of the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He continues in verse 12 by saying, "So speak and so do as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the context, the royal law, the Mosaic law, and the law of freedom are one and the same law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>James was one hundred percent for the law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He taught people to observe, to keep, the Mosaic law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When James spoke of the royal law, he was speaking of only one commandment of the Mosaic law, that is, to love our neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was for perfection, and a perfect man should love his neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a high point of human perfection, so James called this the royal law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By this we can see that he appreciated the law more highly than the psalmists did.</S>
