TO BE UP TO DATE WITH THE FLOW OF THE AGE</h2>
<p>The elders need to help the church to be up to date with the flow of the age, because the Lord is always advancing. This is not easy, because the ways of the older generation have been cultivated and set, and the younger generation is tender and inexperienced. We are in a transitional period with a gap between the generations in life and experience. Some of our crops are yellowing with age, but at the same time we do not have new green crops. In such a large church as Taipei, it would not be easy to let young brothers in their twenties or thirties be elders, but leaving the church in the hands of older elders also poses difficulties. Thus, the elders must be open to change.</p>
<p>I was born in Christianity and grew up under the influence of the Western culture. I was very Westernized. I learned English sixty years ago, but because of the circumstances and the atmosphere then, I was very cautious about speaking English or wearing Western-style suits. Whenever someone wore a Western-style suit, he would receive harsh criticism from those who considered themselves to be traditionalists. Hence, everyone kept the old way and followed tradition. Eventually, however, some were not afraid, and they took the lead to wear Western-style suits. Gradually, Western-style suits became more common, and on formal occasions they even began to be required. Although the elders in Taipei are older, they must take the lead to &ldquo;wear Western-style suits.&rdquo; Because the Lord has a new leading, the elders must take the lead to keep up with Him. If the elders do not move when they hear something concerning the Lord&rsquo;s new leading, it will be difficult to keep up with the flow of the age.</p>
<p>From what I have seen of the young people recently, I feel that they have a heart for the Lord and that they are willing to spend the time to learn. They can release their spirit, and their spirit is fresh. I also understand that the older ones still want the young ones to follow the old ways; they are not at ease whenever the young ones do not follow the old ways. But we are in a new age, and it is difficult for the young ones to follow the old ways. The older saints must &ldquo;put on Western-style suits&rdquo; and be up to date, and the young saints must be patient and not have intense reactions against the older saints.</p>
<p>The older saints must recognize their actual condition and respect the younger generation, who should eventually surpass them. The elders should not boast in their seniority but should submit to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;I have nothing, and I know nothing of the flow of Your move. Have mercy on me; I would like to start learning afresh.&rdquo; If we do this, we will be blessed. The Lord is advancing in the twentieth century; He cannot go back to the nineteenth century. He is always advancing.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Lord Jesus was born, His parents brought Him to the temple. At that time, two elderly Jews, Simeon and Anna, were in the temple. They were devout people living before the Lord. When they saw the baby Jesus, they knew that He was the Messiah, the coming Christ (Luke 2:25-38). Although they were devout, they were also influenced by the Old Testament age, and they were strongly attached to the temple. If the Lord had called them to come out of the temple and to follow Him when He began to minister, it would have been impossible for them to do so.</p>
<p>Thus, when the Lord Jesus began to call people, He did not call anyone who was too old; He called a group of young men by the Sea of Galilee. The twelve apostles were young men. The Lord Himself was only thirty years old when He began to minister and only thirty-three and a half years old when He was crucified. None of His disciples were older than He was. Peter, Andrew, James, and John were not set in their ways. When the Lord said, &ldquo;Come after Me,&rdquo; they immediately left their nets and followed Him (Matt. 4:18-22). Would Simeon have left the temple and followed the Lord if the Lord had said, &ldquo;Come after Me&rdquo;? I am afraid that he would not have been able to follow the Lord. The Lord knew that Simeon was set in his ways, even though he was devout and loved God. Simeon would have been unable to keep up with the Lord&rsquo;s new way. This was not only the case with Simeon and Anna but even with Joseph from Arimathea and Nicodemus, who helped bury the Lord Jesus. There is no record that either of these two remained in Jerusalem to continue steadfastly in prayer with the twelve apostles (John 19:38-42; Acts 1:12-14). When the church appeared on the earth in Jerusalem, possibly no elder was over thirty years old.</p>
<p>I hope the elders would have the light, sense, and understanding to know that the Lord only goes forward; the Lord is taking a new way in this age. We must consider our service: are we set in our ways, or can we adapt to the Lord&rsquo;s need in this age? Even though the Bible does not explicitly address the matter of how long a brother should serve as an elder, we often assume that it is for life. We need to consider whether our old ways merely correspond to our being old or whether we can advance with the Lord. We did not have this problem twenty-five years ago, but we have it today. The age is new, the flow is new, but we are old. If we are determined to turn from our oldness to become like children, not following old methods or giving old messages, then we can serve in the flow. We need much light and grace to be intensified to the point that we drop our old methods and follow the up-to-date flow.</p>
<p>We all are in about the same situation today; those who are old are too old, and those who are young are not yet able to walk according to the Lord&rsquo;s new flow. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has had a good beginning in the United States, and it is moving very quickly there. Soon it will spread to other continents. Not long ago we had a conference in Europe with at least three hundred saints. There even has been a good beginning in Africa. Furthermore, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has reached Australia and New Zealand; in these places there is a fresh atmosphere that is better than the condition in the Far East. It is easy for the Lord to have a new beginning in places where there are not old roots; with half the effort in the work and in the leading, there are twice the results. Places with old roots, however, get only half the result with twice the effort, because our oldness cancels out much of the effectiveness of our work. This shows that we truly need to be before the Lord and seek to improve. On the one hand, those who are elderly must endeavor to advance in this new age, and on the other hand, the young people need to be burdened but not rash.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
