   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST AS OUR SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 1:19 says, "For me this will turn out to salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regardless of our circumstances, the life-giving Spirit becomes our salvation through His bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, if a man falls into the water, I can save him by dragging him out of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of salvation merely delivers him from drowning; he does not gain me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is saved, but he does not gain me as his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What this verse means is that when a brother is in the midst of afflictions, because the Spirit of the Lord is in him, he is strengthened when he calls, "O Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more he calls, the more strengthened he is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually when he is filled by the Holy Spirit, he is strengthened and empowered to overcome the oppression of afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this way the Lord becomes his salvation in him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here you see that this brother is not only saved, but even more he has experienced the Spirit in him as his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christians, when reading this word, "for me this will turn out to salvation," understand it as an objective salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the Spirit of Jesus Christ turning out to be our salvation is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only does He save us outwardly, but even more He becomes our salvation inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ in us becoming our salvation can be likened to the life in our body being our daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, if your feet get trapped in the mud and if you are a person made of wood, a lifeless person, or you are a weakling, then you need others to pull you out of the mud.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But as long as you are a living person with the power of life within you, the life in you will enable you to extricate your feet from the mud.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, the life in your body is your salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When medical doctors diagnose illnesses, they invariably tell patients that medicine helps cure an illness, but the real cure to someone's illness is the life in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If your physical life is healthy and strong, it cures you every day until your body fully recuperates.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the life in your body is your salvation; this is not an objective, outward salvation, but rather a subjective, inward salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus has become the Spirit of life in our spirit as our subjective salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Philippians 1:20 says, "As always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although the Lord Jesus as the Spirit indwelling our spirit is abstract, impalpable, and invisible, He is indeed saving us inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus has become the life-giving Spirit as our life and our salvation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST'S SALVATION IN OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ has become the life-giving Spirit as the life and life supply in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we must live in our spirit to experience the salvation and the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man has a three-layer constitution: the outermost layer is the body; within the body is the second layer, which is the soul; and within the soul is the third layer, which is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today Christ is the Spirit, and within us we also have a spirit; therefore, we can experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The two spirits the Lord's Spirit and our spirit are mingled and have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This may be compared to metal conducting electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we sin, an insulation comes between us and the Lord and then the "electricity" cannot pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At such a time we need to open up to Him in our spirit to repent and confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way the barrier of sin is removed; immediately we can have fellowship with the Lord Spirit and once again experience His salvation within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the Lord Jesus is no longer a doctrine to us but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the Spirit, He now indwells our spirit so that we can daily experience Him as our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>ONE PROBLEM BEING ACCUSTOMED TO LIVING ACCORDING TO THE SOUL AND NOT ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we have a spirit, do we live by this spirit in our daily life?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Indeed, we have the spirit in us, yet we do not live according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are accustomed to living according to our soul in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We delight in and are accustomed to using our mind to consider, our emotion to love or to hate, and our will to decide.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every day we live according to our soul instead of according to the spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before you were saved, you spoke recklessly and you lied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But now that you have repented and believed in the Lord, you realize that you should behave differently.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, you do not commit outward sins and you do not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, just as your lying was of yourself, now your not lying is also of yourself; formerly your reckless behavior was of yourself, but now your proper behavior is also of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You are not living according to the spirit but according to yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Consequently, although the Lord Jesus lives in your spirit, He is securely confined and restricted in you; you do not allow Him to live out through you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Instead, you are still living out your old habits and your old self.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Old habits are very difficult to change.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let me tell you a true story.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In my early years in my hometown, Chefoo, there were electric lamps and telephones, but only very few people had them installed in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we came home after dark, we would look for a match to light the kerosene lamp; we did this every day such that it became our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1939 my house finally had electric lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, during the first couple of months, when I went home at the end of a busy day and noticed the room was dark, I would still spontaneously look for a match to light the kerosene lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>My children would laugh at me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is also the story of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our speaking and our thoughts can be likened to lighting the kerosene lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The kerosene lamp is our self, whereas the electric lamp is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although we have the electric lamp installed in us from heaven, we are still controlled by our old habit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead of appropriating the electric lamp by turning on the switch, our spirit, we light up our kerosene lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not using what one already has is tantamount to not having that thing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As believers, we have the Lord Jesus in our spirit, but our problem is that we do not use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are accustomed to living according to the soul and not according to the spirit.</S>
