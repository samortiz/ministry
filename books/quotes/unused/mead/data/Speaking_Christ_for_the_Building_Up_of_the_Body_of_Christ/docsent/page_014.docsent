   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING SOME OF THE HYMNS ON CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT, THE CHURCH, LIFE, ETC.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN OUR HYMNAL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The speaking ones in our meetings must know some of the hymns on Christ, the Spirit, the church, life, etc. in our hymnal 1 Cor 14:26; Eph 5:19; Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we want to know the hymnal, we must spend some time to get into the table of contents of our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The hymns are divided into thirty major categories arranged in a proper sequence according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each major category has a number of subcategories.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under the major category Experience of Christ there are thirty-two subcategories.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank the Lord that we have the Bible and also a hymnal with hymns that were composed according to the truths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our main hymnal has one thousand and eighty hymns, and our supplement has two hundred and sixty-eight hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We composed our main hymnal with so many hymns to show others that we in the Lord s recovery have the knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We put many hymns into the hymnal mainly for our knowledge of the truth and not for our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among these one thousand and eighty hymns, there are at least over three hundred very good hymns which are good for singing and for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should know a hymn like #499 Oh, what a life!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Oh, what a peace! and we should learn to speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From now on we have to learn to use the hymns firstly for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Singing the hymns is not as important as speaking them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have discovered in the Word and in our experience that speaking a hymn is much more important and profitable than singing it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hymn #501 O glorious Christ, Savior mine and hymn #539 O Lord, Thou art the Spirit! are other excellent hymns that we should know and learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must endeavor to learn a number of the crucial hymns in our hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>DESPERATELY ENDEAVORING TO BUILD UP A HABIT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>OF SPEAKING IN ANY MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all have to desperately endeavor to build up a habit of speaking in any meeting 1 Cor 14:26, 4-5, 12, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be desperate to build up a habit to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This habit has to be built up universally in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not have such a habit due to the background of Christianity, and our function has been killed because of this background.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Chinese people do not speak English well because they did not have the habit of speaking English when they grew up, and they still do not have this habit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I did not pick up the habit of speaking English until I began to minister the word in the United States in 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was hard for me to acquire this habit, but for my grandchildren it was easy because they grew up in an English-speaking environment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we learn to build up a habit of speaking in any meeting, our children, the new ones, will spontaneously become speaking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The new ones will follow the trend and the atmosphere in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They will pick up the habit of speaking easily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must endeavor to do this because it is not just for ourselves but for the benefit of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to overthrow the old, traditional, and unscriptural way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Nee told us that the Lord s Day message meeting with one person speaking and the others listening was a waste, that it was not worthwhile to maintain, and that it was according to the customs of the nations see Church Affairs, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>68-75, 85-86 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we have to overthrow this practice, it is hard to overthrow because it is our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we give up this habit and do not have anything to replace it, we will have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It seems that we cannot live or survive as a Christian without this traditional way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why we need a new start in the recovery, and this new start depends on us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we would pick up the burden to practice this fellowship in order to be the speaking ones in our meetings, a habit will be built up among us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How could anyone take away the speaking of English from the people of the United States?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is impossible because this has been founded and built up as a habit among them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We also need such a foundation of speaking Christ in all our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If not within five years, perhaps within ten years, such a habit will be prevailing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then even the unbelievers will have their concept changed concerning the Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Most of the unbelievers today have the concept that a Christian meeting is to have a pastor or a preacher speak while all the others listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even before they get saved, they already have this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to overthrow this practice and build up another habit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All of us can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have the Bible, a hymnal, the Life-study Messages, and other spiritual publications to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we spoke a Life-study Message together, this would make the best message full of the divine riches and the refreshing utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not merely read the message but speak it, and this speaking should not be an individual speaking but a corporate speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May we all rise up to pick up the burden to be the speaking ones in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May we be desperate to practice speaking and to build up a habit of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a great thing for the Lord s recovery, for His move on this earth, and this practice will really build up every saint in life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>ALWAYS HAVING SOMETHING TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>IN ALL THE MEETINGS AS A FREEWILL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>TO GOD AND TO THE AUDIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should always have something to speak in all the meetings as a freewill offering to God and to the audience 1 Cor 14:26 and note 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In all our meetings we should not speak merely out of being forced or compelled to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our speaking should be an offering of our free will to God for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their enlightening, nourishing, and building up.</S>
