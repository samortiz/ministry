   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When Abraham believed God's first promise, God gave what He promised to him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Later, when God gave Abraham the second promise, he could not believe it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What did God then do?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He made a covenant with Abraham, so that he would believe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A covenant makes up for what a promise lacks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is the best way to deal with unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though we may not believe, God cannot change what He has promised.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, our unbelief forces Him to make a covenant with us so that we will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham did not believe God's second promise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What did God do?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 15:9-10 says, "And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Abraham understood what this meant.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was the way men covenanted with each other in his day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a person entered into a covenant with another person, he cut a heifer or a goat in half and laid each half of the sacrifice against the other.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The one who made the covenant would then walk through the two halves of the sacrifice as a sign that he had covenanted with the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This sign signified that the covenant passed through the heart and organs, and was sealed with blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The body of an animal was cut in half and the blood was shed, then God Himself passed through the two halves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This signifies that the covenant that He had made would never change and never fail.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After He did this, "in that same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates" v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Friends, have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Genesis 15, God gave half of the promise to Abraham, which was to have seed as numerous as the stars in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After he believed this promise and accepted this promise, God gave to him the promise of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God had not only promised him a family, but an inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He not only promised him descendants, but a land for them to dwell in and live on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abram did not have the capacity to accept this promise.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If God had not opened His mouth, His words would not be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, since God had uttered His promise, He had to fulfill His words according to His promise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If a man did not believe it, however, the promise would be made of none effect.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, God had to make a covenant with man, so that man would realize that God had to fulfill His word and carry it out so that there would be no unfaithfulness on His part.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Unfaithfulness is a sin; God could surely not do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To promise something without giving it is unrighteous and dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is walking contrary to the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God did not only give a promise and facts for man to apply.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did not only say with His mouth what He would do for man and show man the accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He made a covenant with man with the intention that man could lay hold of Him through the covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God knew that Abram had only so much faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The inheritance that God promised was too great and wonderful; it was beyond the capacity of his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God knew that He had to increase the capacity of Abram's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God covenanted with Abram to increase his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not only did God promise to do it, He made a covenant to do it so that Abram could not do anything other than believe.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once God had made a covenant, it would be unfaithful, unrighteous, and illegal for Him not to act according to His covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Under this circumstance, faith has to increase.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reason God makes a covenant with us, and does not just give promises or facts to us, is because He cares for the smallness of our faith in the same way that He cared for Abraham's lack of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wants us to learn to lay hold of His righteousness, faithfulness, and rightful glory, just as Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a small thing for us to lose our blessing; it is a great thing for God to lose His credibility.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now let me read some Scriptures where men dealt with God on the basis of covenants, so that you will understand the matter more fully.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Psalms 143:1, "Hear my prayer, O Lord, / give ear to my supplications: / in thy faithfulness answer me, / and in thy righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>David was not asking God to answer him according to His mercy, lovingkindness, or grace, but according to His faithfulness and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have heard many people praying for God to answer them in His mercy and love, or according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But David's prayer was different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He did not ask God to grant him grace, or bless him with mercy and lovingkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His prayer was special.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He only prayed that God would answer him according to His righteousness and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word in here means "according to."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He prayed that God would answer him according to His righteousness and faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you know the meaning of this?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Frankly speaking, only those who understand this point know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Anyone who does not understand this, will not have their prayers answered.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Their prayers will be ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Sometimes we ask God to grant us grace and mercy, and accomplish His will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But sometimes, these prayers are absolutely meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we do not have God's promise or God's Word, it is all right to pray such prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But when God has promised, and when He has given us His Word, these prayers indicate unbelief and become a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have to ask God to accomplish His will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But sometimes, this kind of prayer is offered in either ignorance or unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes when a person prays for a sick one, he does not pray for God to heal, nor does he pray for God to not heal.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He merely prays that God will act according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Apparently, this is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But many times, this is a sign of ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This kind of prayer exposes the laziness of the praying ones; they are not willing to spend the time to seek after God's will and pray according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They only know how to pray to God in an ignorant way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When some start to pray for others, they ask God to heal them and help them to recuperate quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But when the illness becomes serious or terminal, they change their tone and ask that God's will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This prayer really means: "God, You are not answering my prayer now, and I cannot pray for the healing anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This person is critically ill, and there is no chance for him to get better.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, I only ask that Your will be done, and that You allow him to die."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What kind of prayer is this?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This kind of prayer does not have any assurance or any faith to it.</S>
