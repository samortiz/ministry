   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have to pay attention to Ephesians 1, 2, and 6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter one shows us the position of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter two shows us the church's position in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapter six shows us what the church should do after it has acquired its position in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapter one is on Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapter two is on the church being in the heavenlies together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Chapter six is on spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has made the church sit together with Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the church does not sit there forever; God also causes it to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, chapter two mentions sitting, while chapter six mentions standing; we stand in our position in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"For our wrestling is..against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies...and having done all, to stand" Eph 6:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our warfare is against the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, it is a spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 6:18-19 says, "By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints, and for me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a prayer concerning spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of prayer is different from ordinary prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ordinary prayer is directed from earth to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the prayer here is not from earth to heaven; it begins from a heavenly position and goes from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A prayer with authority has heaven as its starting point and the earth as its destination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, a prayer with authority is prayed from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everyone who knows how to pray knows what it is to pray upward and what it is to pray downward.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a man has never learned the prayer that prays downward, he has never learned to pray with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the spiritual warfare, the kind of prayer that prays downward is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is a prayer that prays downward?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is to stand in the position that Christ has given us in the heavenlies, to command Satan with authority and reject all his works, and to proclaim with authority that all God's commands should be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we pray for a realization of God's will and a decision concerning it, we should not say, "God, I ask You to accomplish this."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, we should say, "God, You have to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have to accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter what happens, You must fulfill this work."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a commanding prayer, a prayer with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The meaning of the word amen is not "so be it" or "may it be so," but "it will be so" and "it will surely come to pass."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you pray and I say amen, I am saying that things will turn out according to the way you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Events must transpire this way, and your prayer will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a commanding prayer, a prayer of command that issues from faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can say this because we have a heavenly standing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were brought to our heavenly standing when Christ ascended to the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As soon as Christ ascended to the heavenlies, we were there also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is like saying that as soon as Christ died and resurrected, we died and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, we must see the heavenly position of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Satan begins his work by trying to take away our position in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The heavenly position is a position of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as we stand in that position, we have victory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If Satan succeeds in dragging us down from the heavenlies, we will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Victory is standing continuously in the heavenly position of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Satan will tell us that we are on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we agree with him that we are on earth, we will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan will try to frustrate us by our defeat and make us think that we are indeed on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if we stand up and declare, "Christ is in the heavenlies, and we are also in the heavenlies," and hold onto our position in the heavenlies, we will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, it is a big thing to stand in the right position.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A prayer with authority has the position of being in the heavenlies as its basis.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since the church is in the heavenlies with Christ, it can pray with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is praying with authority?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Simply put, it is praying the prayer of Mark 11.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to be clear about this truth, we should consider verses 23-24 carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 24 begins with the words "for this reason."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"For this reason" means that this sentence is a continuation of what has gone before.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This means that verse 24 is joined to verse 23.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 24 mentions prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This proves that verse 23 must also concern prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The strange thing is that verse 23 does not sound like an ordinary prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord did not tell us to pray, "God, please move the mountain and cast it into the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What does it say?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It says, "Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to our concept, what should a prayer be like?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We think that when we pray to God, we have to say, "God, please move this mountain and cast it into the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the Lord said something else.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He did not tell us to speak to God; He told us to turn to the mountain and to speak to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The speaking is not toward God but directly toward the mountain, telling it to be cast into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Since the Lord was afraid that we would not consider this to be a prayer, He pointed out in the following verse that it is a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This prayer is not directed toward God, but it is a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a speaking directed toward the mountain that says, "Be taken up and cast into the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yet this is also a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a prayer with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A prayer with authority does not ask God to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Rather, it exercises God's authority and applies this authority to deal with problems and things that ought to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every overcomer has to learn to pray this kind of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every overcomer has to learn to speak to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have many weaknesses, such as temper, evil thoughts, or physical illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we plead with God concerning these problems, it seems that there is not much result.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, if we apply God's authority to the situation and speak to the mountain, these problems will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What is the meaning of the word "mountain" in this verse?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A mountain is a problem that stands in front of us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A mountain is something that blocks the way and stops us from going on.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we see a mountain, what do we do?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When many people encounter a mountain in their life or in their work, they pray to God to remove the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But God tells us to speak to the mountain ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All we have to do is issue a word of command to the mountain: "Be taken up and cast into the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>There is a great difference between asking God to remove the mountain and commanding the mountain to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is one thing to go to God and ask Him to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is another thing to directly command the mountain to be cast away.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We often overlook this kind of commanding prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Seldom do we pray by applying God's authority to the problem or by saying, "I command you in the name of my Lord to go away" or "I cannot tolerate this thing to remain with me anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A prayer with authority is one in which we tell the things that are frustrating us to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We can say to our temper, "Go away."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We can say to sickness, "Go away.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I will rise up by the resurrection life of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This word is not spoken to God but directly to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>"Be taken up and cast into the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is a prayer with authority.</S>
