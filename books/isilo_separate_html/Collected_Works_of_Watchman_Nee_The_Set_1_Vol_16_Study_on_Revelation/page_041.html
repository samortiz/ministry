Some go first, and some go later; but here all of the man-child is raptured at the same time.</P><P>(3) The promise of shepherding all nations with an iron rod is not given to the whole church but to the overcomers (2:26-27), and not all in the church are overcomers.</P><P>(4) The matter of reigning is not for the whole church since only those who suffer together with the Lord may reign together with Him (2 Tim. 2:12).</P><P>Who then is the man-child? He refers to the overcoming Christians who have died.</P><P>(1) He must include some of those in the church in Smyrna, those who were faithful unto death (Rev. 2:10). This matches 12:11, which says, "even unto death."</P><P>(2) He includes some of those in the church in Thyatira, those who will shepherd all nations with an iron rod (2:26-27). This matches 12:5, which says, "To shepherd all the nations with an iron rod."</P><P>(3) He includes some of those in the church in Philadelphia, those who will be saved from and not subjected to the tribulation (3:10). This matches 12:5, which says that the man-child is "caught up to God."</P><P>(4) He also includes some of those in the church in Laodicea, those who will sit on the throne (3:21). This matches 12:5, which says that the man-child will "shepherd all the nations."</P><P>Hence, the man-child is neither the whole church nor a part of those in various local churches. They are the overcomers in the churches. They are the Christians who were martyred and resurrected, because: (1) Revelation 12:11 expressly says that they loved not their soul-life even unto death, and (2) "brought forth" here symbolizes resurrection.</P><P>In covering Revelation 7:16-17 we have already mentioned eight points that match what is recorded here. The man-child is a major part of the great multitude that no man can number. (Chapter seven speaks in a general way, revealing an outline of the rapture, whereas chapter twelve speaks in detail about a portion of the raptured ones.)</P><P>Matthew 25:1 through 13 is a parable concerning the ten virgins, hence; the word "slept" cannot be interpreted literally. Furthermore, we cannot say that it means unwatchfulness, because the five wise virgins also slept. Therefore, sleep indicates death. The five wise virgins are the man-child in Revelation 12:5, and the five foolish virgins are a part which includes the remnant of the woman's seed in Revelation 12:17 (there are survivors among this part).</P><P>Revelation 12:5 says that this group of Christians has died, resurrected, and been raptured.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Revelation 12:6</H2><P>"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days." </P><P>The fleeing of the woman is the flight that is described in Matthew 24:6-20 and Luke 21:20-24. In Revelation 12:1 the woman is in heaven; in 12:6 she is in the wilderness. Immediately after the man-child is born, she loses her position in heaven. She is now just the earthly Jerusalem. The wilderness means a desolate and uninhabited place. God nourishes her at this time in the same way that He once nourished the children of Israel in the wilderness.</P><P>In Galatians 4:21-31 there are two contrasts. The first is between the Jerusalem in heaven and the Jerusalem on earth; the one signifies the Christians, and the other, the Jews. One is represented by Isaac, and the other, by Ishmael. The main thought, however, is to prove that we Christians are free in the same way that Isaac was free.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. WAR IN HEAVEN<br>(REVELATION 12:7-9)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 12:7</H2><P>"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon. And the dragon warred and his angels."</P><P>The war determines who is to live in the heavens-the man-child or the dragon. The man-child now wants to obtain the position of the dragon; hence, he must go to war. In the whole Bible there is only one archangel-Michael. The meaning of this name is "the one who is very much like God" (some say that Michael is the Lord Jesus). During the time of Job, the dragon could come before the presence of God (Job 1:7). He could also do this during the Lord's time. But after the man-child is caught up, he can no longer do this.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
