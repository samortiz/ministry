[1]  Additional Word 1 The Mystery of Christ The Church <
[2]  Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depth of our being.
[3]  Under Your sovereignty, You have arranged the circumstances and have prepared all of us to be gathered together from all the scattered places into Your name.
[4]  May You bring us into all that we pray and ask for and grant us all the glorious facts that we beseech You for, so that we would know Christ, the Body of Christ, the economy of God, and God's move on earth today.
[5]  The history of the Lord's recovery has not been that long among us.
[6]  I personally passed through these few turmoils and took the lead in taking care of them.
[7]  This time during the Asia elders' and co-workers' meeting, besides the elders and co-workers on the whole island plus those from overseas churches, we have two hundred eighty full-time brothers and sisters who are here as participants.
[8]  It is a rare opportunity for all of us to be able to gather here this time.
[9]  I feel deeply that the best thing to do is to come back to the Lord's word together, to enjoy the Lord and His presence, and to have some prayers in one accord.

[11]  The invisible Word of God becoming visible flesh John 1:14: The mysterious God being conceived of His Spirit and begotten in the womb of a human virgin Matt 1:20b.
[12]  Then from the virgin's womb being born with humanity to be the mysterious God-man, in whom both divinity and humanity are mingled, and who is called Emmanuel God with us Matt 1:23.
[13]  This mysterious God-man, in His mysterious resurrection, ascending to the height with all the ones whom He resurrected Eph 4:8a; 2:6: Offering to God the ones whom He resurrected; God giving them back to Him, and He giving them as gifts to the church Eph 4:8b.
[14]  Under Your sovereignty, You have arranged all the circumstances so that we can sanctify this precious time to gather together before You and even to enter into You through, by, and around Your word.
[15]  Of all the mysteries in God's New Testament economy, the first of them is the mystery of God.
[16]  Third, this mysterious God-man passed through human living in His humanity with His mysterious divinity.
[17]  The fifth main point is that this mysterious God-man, who was crucified, was resurrected from the dead with His crucified humanity by His eternal and immortal divinity Acts 2:23-24; 3:15 .
[18]  Moreover, as the mysterious only begotten Son of God, in His mysterious resurrection He was begotten with His humanity as the Son of Man to be the mysterious firstborn Son of God Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29 , causing all His believers to be resurrected with Him and to be brought forth as the sons of God to be His brothers, who constitute the church of God 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:19; Heb 2:11-12 , which is His Body.
[19]  While I was listening to your pray-reading this morning, I had a feeling within me.
[20]  We all know that Christ is the mystery of God and that the church is the mystery of Christ.
[21]  What I desire to see is that all the churches would have a thorough understanding concerning Christ and the church.
[22]  We who are in the church should not talk about anything else but Christ and the church from the beginning of the year till the end of the year.
[23]  CHAPTER TWO THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6, 9-10; 1:3-14, 19-23; 2:5-6, 15, 19-22; Rom 5:17b; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Eph 4:16; 3:2, 7-11, 15-19; 5:32; Rev 21:2-3, 22, 11-14; 22:1-2 The church being mysteriously chosen and predestinated in Christ by God the Father before the foundation of the world Eph 1:3-5: Being chosen to be holy v. 4.
[24]  Being predestinated unto sonship through Jesus Christ to God the Father v. 5.
[25]  The church being mysteriously redeemed in the Beloved after the foundation of the world Eph 1:6-12: This being the grace with which God graced the church in the Beloved according to the riches of God's abounding grace vv.
[26]  Mysteriously being made alive together with Christ regenerated John 3:5-6 , being raised up together taking Christ as life and living together with Him Col 3:4a; John 14:19b , and being seated in the heavenlies together participating in all that Christ has attained and obtained in His ascension Eph 2:5-6 .
[27]  In the organic Body of Christ, in the living in the universal new man, which is constituted with God as life, and in the living in God's house of life and in God's kingdom of life, there being no lifeless organizations such as a universal federation or local autonomies: There obviously being the need in the churches in all the localities to have some administrative arrangements for the business affairs; these administrative arrangements seemingly being non-organic.
[28]  Prayer: Lord, for this meeting we look to You for the cleansing of Your blood so that we may enjoy Your presence and Your anointing.
[29]  You have indeed opened up to us the mystery in Your Word in this end time.
[30]  THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST THE CHURCH Being Mysteriously Chosen and Predestinated
[31]  First, the church was mysteriously chosen and predestinated in Christ by God the Father before the foundation of the world Eph 1:3-5 .
[32]  Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy, and that He predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself.
[33]  In the dispensation of God's economy, not only has He brought us to Himself, and caused us to believe and to be saved, but He has also headed us, the church, up together with all things under Christ the Head, that the church, according to God's counsel and predestination, which is according to His will, may be made a chosen possession under Christ the Head to become those who have before hoped in Christ.
[34]  God has given us the Holy Spirit not only as the pledge of our possession, assuring us of what we will possess, but also as the foretaste of our inheritance of God as our possession, that we may gain a foretaste of God as our full possession.
[35]  Sixth, since the church as the Body of Christ is the universal new man, the kingdom of God, the house of God, and the habitation of God, it mysteriously enjoys the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:2, 7-11 .
[36]  Seventh, the church, being strengthened in its members into the inner man with power by God through His Spirit, has Christ mysteriously making home in the believers' hearts, with the result that it is filled with the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of what Christ is, to become all the fullness of God Eph 3:15-19 .
[37]  Finally, we have point number nine, which is the mysterious ultimate consummation in God's economy, the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 .
[38]  This is the peak, the climax, of the union and mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man, resulting in the tabernacle where God dwells and lives with man, and the temple where man dwells and serves God.
[39]  In the last message on the mystery of Christ, the church, there were two main points that I would like you to pay attention to: the mysterious enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ for the manifestation of the multifarious wisdom of God and the mysterious making home in our heart by Christ unto our being filled with the breadth, length, height, and depth of what Christ is to become all the fullness of God.
[40]  These two items, the riches of Christ and His making home in our hearts, on the one hand touch our personal experience and on the other hand consummate in the church.
[41]  The manifestation of the multifarious wisdom of God as well as becoming all the fullness of God point to the highest plane that the church can attain to, which is to be the ultimate expression of the Triune God.
[42]  For this reason, I want to consider this matter in a more definite way so that we may have definite experiences.
[43]  We do not want to experience Christ in a vague and abstract way.
[44]  Often our talk about the enjoyment of Christ, the living of Christ, and the expression of Christ are just vague words.
[45]  1:15-21; Eph 1:22; Rev 21:2, 11; 22:1; John 15:1; Eph 4:4-6; Col 1:27; Eph 4:22-24, 30; 5:25b-27, 29; 4:11-16; Col 3:3-4a; 1 Cor 12:25-27; Rom 8:2-13; 12:4-8; 1 Cor 12:14-22; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rom 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Pet 2:2; Rom 12:1; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 12, 24, 31; Col 1:28-29 The mysterious center in God's economy: The move of God's New Testament economy being like the turning of a big wheel cf.
[46]  This turning wheel in God's economy having the Body of Christ as its axis: All of God's move and work today being joined to and being for the Body of Christ Eph 1:22.
[47]  THE BODY OF CHRIST AS THE AXIS OF GOD'S ECONOMY
[48]  The true vine in John 15, as a portrait of Christ, is the organism of the Triune God by which He accomplishes His eternal economy.
[49]  Following this, let us consider the metamorphic change of this organism the mingling of God and man Eph 4:22-24 .
[50]  Finally, let us look at the living and service of this organism.
[51]  The living of this organism is the corporate and organic living of the Body of Christ Rom 12:5 .
[52]  IN GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Col 3:4a; Rom 8:2; 7:21, 23, 25b; 8:6b, 4b, 13; 12:6-8; 1 Cor 12:8-10, 28; Gal 2:20a; 5:16a, 25; 1 Thes 5:17; Eph 6:17 The law of the Spirit of life being the key to the mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy: The mysterious organism in God's New Testament economy depending on Christ being our life Col 3:4a.
[53]  The Father as the source of life in the Body of Christ producing the Son as the life element of the Body of Christ; the Son as the life element in the Body of Christ bringing in the Spirit as the capacity of the Body of Christ.
[54]  The law in the life of the Body of Christ, that is, its innate ability, being a living person, the Spirit of life; the Spirit of life being the realization of Christ as life to His Body; Christ as the life of His Body being the embodiment of God the Father as the source of life hence, the Triune God Himself having become the law, that is, the innate ability, in the Body of Christ.
[55]  Prayer: Lord Jesus, we would bow down before You and offer to You our praise from the depth of our being.
[56]  You have brought us through the past three days.
[57]  THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE The Law of the Spirit of Life
[58]  The first person is God, who has become the first law, the law of the Spirit of life Rom 8:2a .
[59]  This results in God the Son being the life element of the Body of Christ, and as the element of the Body of Christ, God the Son brings in God the Spirit as the capacity of the Body of Christ.
[60]  Fourth, Christ is the life element of the Body of Christ, and the Spirit of life is the essence of this element.
[61]  This essence becomes the law in the Body of Christ, which is the innate ability of the Body of Christ.
[62]  We have said that the mysterious organism of God is fully a matter of Christ being our life.
[63]  Finally, point number eight talks about the cooperation needed by the law of the Spirit of life in God's economy.
[64]  When we continue to live in the fellowship with this Lord, who is the Spirit of life within us and the law in the Body of Christ, we will have the genuine living and service of the Body of Christ.
