   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REST FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must realize why God said that this land was the rest for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The lamb was not the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The manna was not the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the land is the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The people of Israel enjoyed the passover lamb, but they did not enter into rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They enjoyed the manna day by day for forty years, but they still did not enter into rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We know what rest is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rest is something complete, something in full, something perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you have everything, then you can really rest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the passover lamb was not the complete and perfect portion for God s people, it was not the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was good to a certain point, but it was not the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The manna too was good in a particular aspect, but it was not the full, the perfect, and the complete portion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only the land was the rest to the people of God, because the land was the completion, the perfection, and the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the land you have everything; the land will satisfy you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By Hebrews 3 and 4, we may realize that the land which was the rest to the people of Israel is the type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the rest because Christ is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Most of us are still not in the position to realize Christ as the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We just know Him as our Savior, as our Redeemer, as our life, and as our way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Very few of us know Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The land is the goal; the land is the aim; the land is the eternal purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unless we are able to realize Christ as the land, we are lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must see that there is much more than what we have experienced of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have only a little experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what burdens us very much in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do believe the Lord is going to recover this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE GOODNESS OF THE LAND</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many times in the Old Testament this piece of land is called a good land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is really remarkable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I will bring you into a good land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you do not pay special attention to this, you will feel that it is just an ordinary statement.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are always saying that something is good; it becomes just an ordinary mode of description to us with no special significance attached to it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when the Lord says that something is good, we must pay attention.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is not commonplace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And He says it over and over: a good land...a good land...a good land!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It must really be good!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is the goodness of this land?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the Lord said that it is a good land, what then is its goodness?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the past most of us have not paid much attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have just taken it as the good land and let it go at that, not inquiring into the reason for its goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is rather difficult to fully define the goodness of this land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First of all, I will point out to you a rather peculiar definition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have read it already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exodus 3:8 says, I am come...to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large ASV a large land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mr. J. N. Darby informs us that it is better to translate the word large as spacious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a good and spacious land.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is good first of all in spaciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You understand what spaciousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But can you describe the spaciousness of this land?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Can you tell us the extent, the expanse, of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In other words, do you know how big Christ is?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every one of us has a certain measurement, but what is the measurement of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The apostle Paul gives it to us in Ephesians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The measurements of Christ are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Can you tell how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you asked me, I would have to say, I don t know.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The breadth of Christ is the breadth of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ is the breadth, Christ is the length, Christ is the height, and Christ is the depth of the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the universe has a limit, that limit must be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You can never measure the dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the first item of the goodness of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The land is good in the unlimited measurement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>APPLYING THE SPACIOUSNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now I would ask you, How can you apply this?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Can you apply the measurement of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Can you apply the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One day a sister came to me and said, Brother, you know my family.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You know that my husband is such and such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yes, I said, I know, I know.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>And you know I have five children, and one more is coming that will make six.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I am still young, and I am afraid that after the sixth there may be more.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brother, I am concerned about this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then I asked her, Sister, do you know how big Christ is?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She said, Oh, brother, this is a strange question.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have never thought about that.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What do you mean?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then I brought her to realize that the Christ whom she had received is an unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But it is not easy to help people realize how great Christ is in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brother, she said, I know that the Lord is so great; I know it quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>So I said, Sister, I am quite familiar with your problem, and I thank the Lord for what you have always experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Tell me, how have you been sustained, how have you been able to stand through all these years?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Oh, she replied, it is the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Without the Lord I could never have made it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then I said, Sister, do you think the Lord is so limited?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If the Lord could help you get through in the past years with one husband and five children, can He not help you make it with one or two children more?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Is the Lord so small, so restricted?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Then she understood.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Brother, of course, the Lord is unlimited, the Lord is unlimited! she exclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I said, Sister, good!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As long as you know the Lord is unlimited, that is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Be at peace and cast all your burden upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Take the Lord as your unlimited help.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Another time a brother came to me and said, Brother, my wife is such and such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I fear that matters will get worse and worse.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I have been able to bear it until now, but if something else happens, I am afraid it will be too much for me; I will have a nervous breakdown.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The very thought is unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Then I answered him in the same way as I did the sister.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Brother, how have you been able to manage during the past years?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Oh, it was only by Christ! he exclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Then I said, Brother, do you think the Lord is limited to this extent?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If you would experience Him in a greater way, if you would experience a greater Christ, you must be ready to encounter a worse situation.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Oh! he cried, That s just what I am afraid of.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It s bad enough now.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>I would ask the Lord to stop right now!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Well, I told him, if this is good enough, you can only know Christ to this extent.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If you want to have an increasing experience of Christ, you must be ready to meet a worse situation day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Oh, brothers, by your experience you may realize the extent, the expanse, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>By your experience you may realize the spaciousness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Christ is good in His unlimitedness.</S>
