<h2 class="head2">Pu-Tien, Fukien Province</h2><p>The brothers in Penang sent us the enclosed amount through the hands of Brothers Ren-jieh and Jin-yang and designated it for co-workers in difficulty. However, we have been under the special care of the Father and dare not accept this money. Therefore, we have forwarded this money to you. Please distribute it to co-workers in difficulty on our behalf. (This amount has been distributed to the co-workers in Hunan and Hankow&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Tsai Tse-chung, Chen Ke-san, Lan Jin-yan, September 30</p><h2 class="head2">Kien-Ou, Fukien Province</h2><p>In the last letter I mentioned that I was going to Min-Ching. But there are obstacles, and I am not able to go now. I passed through all the other places quickly, staying for the longest period of time in Shao-Wu. Thank the Lord that Sisters Chuang and Lee have given excellent testimonies in Shao-Wu. Recently, the Fukien Shie-Ho University moved to Shao-Wu, and a few more brothers who are one in striving for the gospel have been added. Since returning from Shao-Wu, I have written to eleven co-workers in south Fukien, asking them to come to work in north Fukien. Thank the Lord that Brother Chen Ke-san has replied and told me that two or three brothers will come. Probably they can leave for the north next month. I ask you and the saints in K'un-ming who are concerned for the Lord's work to pray earnestly so that the brothers can be filled with the power of the Spirit and spread salvation to Yien-Ping, Kien-Ou, and Shao-Wu, bringing many sinners to salvation. Afterwards, we hope to see meetings properly established and the breaking of bread initiated. Sister Chu Shue-chin has been in Kien-Ou for five months. She is working as a nurse in the Christian Hospital. Lately, she has been sick. When I visited her and talked to her about the Lord's truth, I was overjoyed to find out that she is a sister. She was also comforted by my visit. I know that you are concerned about her. This is why I mentioned this. Shao-yun will graduate from vocational school in Foochow this term, and Jia-en is still here. Thank the Lord that they have made much progress lately. Since you are so concerned for them, I thought that I should report their progress to you. Peace and grace from the Lord to you. Greetings to Sisters Wang and Chang and to Mrs. Nee, the senior Mrs. Nee, Mrs. Weigh, and Sisters Lee and Yu.</p><p>Sister Yu-bing, the evening of September 27</p><h2 class="head2">Swatow</h2><p>The Lord has been protecting us, and we are still safe. Most of the brothers and sisters have returned to Swatow, and the meetings have resumed. We can only thank the Lord. One thing gives us reason for great thanksgiving: He has led His servant Stephen Kaung to come and conduct meetings in Swatow. During the past week we have had gospel meetings in the evenings, in which we have seen His saving grace for sinners. We hope that the Lord will still be gracious to us and give us more meetings starting next Monday. We hope that He will grant us words of edification through His own so that we can grow in grace. Enclosed please find X dollars for brothers and sisters in need and difficulty.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Tsai Gi-chen, Hsie Tse-shun, Chen Wen-kwang,<br />Chen Fang-ching, September 19</p><p>P.S. Enclosed also find X dollars from two sisters in Thailand. Please use it according to their written directions.</p>
