<h2 class="head1">NO SHORTAGE OF GOD&rsquo;S WORD</h2><p>We thank the Lord that the situation in His recovery is altogether different from this. We have an abundance of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Consider how much of the word of God has been released among us in the recovery during the past years. The reason there is so much of God&rsquo;s speaking in the recovery is that here we have genuine oneness. We experience this oneness and the harmony in the Spirit not only when the churches come together for a conference, but also in the meetings of the various local churches. In the meetings we have the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, and we are edified, nourished, and enlightened. When the peace of Christ arbitrates in us and keeps us in a situation full of oneness and harmony, we become the place of God&rsquo;s speaking, His oracle. Deep in my spirit I realize that the meetings are an oracle, a place where God can come in to speak.</p><p>Now we see the connection between 3:15 and 16. The peace of Christ arbitrates in us to keep us in a proper condition to receive God&rsquo;s word. The arbitrating peace of Christ is for God&rsquo;s oracle, the place of His speaking.</p><p>For a proper Christian walk we need to set our mind on things above. When we do this, we &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; to the heavenly transmission, the divine current of &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; which flows from the throne in heaven to us on earth. This transmission causes the renewing of the new man, for it brings a new element, the divine substance, into our being. Following the renewing, we have the arbitrating peace of Christ. The very element of Christ transmitted into us becomes the essence of the peace which rules in us. This arbitrating peace not only solves our problems, but also dissolves them. It enables us to be kept in oneness and to be preserved in a harmonious condition. It also opens the way for the word of God to come with the bountiful supply. Because we have the arbitrating peace, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there is no shortage of God&rsquo;s word.</p><h2 class="head1">FUNCTIONS OF THE WORD OF GOD</h2><h2 class="head2">Enlightening</h2><p>Now we must go on to consider how the word of God functions within us. First, the word of God enlightens us. If we did not have the Word, we would be in darkness. But because God&rsquo;s word is full of light and it enlightens us, it can make us very clear about many different things.</p><h2 class="head2">Nourishing</h2><p>Second, the word of God is food, full of nourishment. This means that God&rsquo;s word nourishes us while it enlightens us. I can testify that throughout the years I have been adequately nourished through the word of God. It truly has been food to me in my experience.</p><h2 class="head2">Quenching Our Thirst</h2><p>The word of God also quenches our thirst. Thirst is even more serious than hunger. Usually a person can go longer without eating than without drinking. If we do not have water, we simply have no way to live. How good that the word of God is not only food, but also the water of life! The word of God enlightens us, feeds us, and quenches our thirst.</p><h2 class="head2">Strengthening</h2><p>Another aspect of the function of the word of God within us is that of strengthening. The word of God strengthens us. Christians are weak because they are thirsty and undernourished. No one who is hungry and thirsty can be strong.</p><p>If we experience the word of God nourishing us and strengthening us, we shall be strong not only in spirit, but also in our soul. In other words, we shall be strong psychologically as well as spiritually. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s word will even strengthen us physically. I can testify that my body is healthy not only because I eat the proper physical food, but also because I take the word of God as my spiritual food. God&rsquo;s word in my spirit makes my spirit strong and happy. This strength and happiness help me to be healthy physically. It is a fact that when we are happy spiritually and psychologically we shall be healthy in body.</p><p>The word of God makes us strong in spirit and also in soul. Strengthened in spirit and soul, we shall be healthy in body. The word of God is the best cure; it strengthens us and it heals us.</p>
