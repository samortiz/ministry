   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SURRENDERING BEING LETTING GO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, what happens when we see the Lord's death for us on the cross, and what happens when we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We immediately stop trying to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As soon as we believe, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Similarly, when we see that the Lord has brought us to the cross and crucified us there, we will cease fighting and stop improving ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Once we believe that the Lord is living within us and overcoming for us, we will stop our own work and allow God to rescue us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We will say, "Lord, I will never improve, and I do not intend to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From now on I will not do anything, I will not manage anything, and I will not be concerned about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From now on I will let go, and problems will no longer be my problems."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brothers and sisters, this is surrendering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some have said that it is very difficult to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When temptation comes, they have to put up a fight, and when their temper rises up, they have to wrestle with it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they resolve to stop doing something and fail, it only means that they make a stronger resolution next time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, one more resolution only means one more failure, and one more promise only means one more broken promise.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more resolutions one makes, the more he fails.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the first resolution is not strong enough, the second resolution will not work even when it is stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans 7 describes this well: To will is present with us, but to work out the good is not v. 18 ! No promise that is made is appropriate because we have not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are still managing our own affairs, and we cannot say that we are crucified with Christ and that it is no longer we who live.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Dying is letting go, resigning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is giving up our efforts to take control and ignoring it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are no longer able, God will become able.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the first thing is letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was a brother by the name of Lee in Tientsin who once asked me how he could resign and let go.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said that he could not resign or let go.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I asked what he did in his company, and he told me that he was the manager of the textile department.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I asked, "If the general manager of the company told you that you were no longer needed by the company the following month and that you were fired, what would you do?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that the only thing he could do would be to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I asked, "Suppose the next month came, the new manager arrived, and you transferred everything to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What would you do if a buyer came to you and asked, Manager, what kind of new fabric do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is its price?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How much do you think this price will go up in two days?'"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brother answered, "If it happened a few days before the new manager arrived, I would make some calculations and find out what the company had in stock and how much it needed to stock up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if I had already transferred everything to the new manager, I would have nothing more to do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All I could do would be to watch others work."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is letting go and surrendering.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is what it means to be crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to say to the Lord, "I am not resigning because I am capable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am resigning because I cannot stand it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am not capable of doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I cannot manage anything any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why I have to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My temper is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My pride is still present.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>My stubbornness and jealousy are all still present.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can do nothing about them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can only make a transfer and resign.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I can only say that everything is in Your hand from now on."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, when "the buyers from the street" show up, we must not be alarmed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are many "buyers" who come every day to solicit business.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All we have to do is commit everything to the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not have to care for or manage anything.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the meaning of overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the meaning of surrendering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>SATAN'S TEMPTATION BEING TO TRY TO MAKE US MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do you know what temptation is?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One brother said that he was always tempted to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Another brother said that he was always tempted to be stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One brother complained that he was always tempted by unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Another brother complained that he was always tempted by a quick tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It seems that there are a thousand different kinds of temptations to a thousand different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But brothers and sisters, there is actually only one temptation in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We think that temptations lead us to temper, pride, greed, or adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But with Satan, there is only one temptation the temptation to move.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Satan does not induce us to lose our temper or to be proud, greedy, or adulterous.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>His temptation is to make us move.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As long as we move, Satan prevails over us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It does not matter how we move.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As long as Satan becomes successful in initiating a move, we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In our prayer and reading of the Bible, he has won the victory the minute we move.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I only wish I could speak with many tears in my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not move.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The minute we move, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can struggle with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We can fight with him or withstand him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But the minute we move, Satan has gained the complete victory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have to realize that the secret to our victory lies in our standing by; it does not lie in our taking control.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Once we try to manage the situation, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Brothers and sisters, this is a most amazing thing!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God wants to set us aside and allow His Son to overcome for us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Galatians 5:17 says, "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This verse does not say that we oppose our lusts or that our lusts oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It says that the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We do not play any part.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These two parties are opposing one another.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A brother once lamented that his only desires were sin and uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He could not help himself.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But it is the flesh who is fighting against the Spirit, and the Spirit who is opposing the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We play no part in this fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is God's way of deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we can stand back and allow the Spirit to fight against the lusts and the lusts to fight against the Spirit, we will experience deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When I was first saved, I heard a story about a young girl who knew the meaning of victory very well.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>During the Keswick Convention, a man asked the little girl how she overcame when the devil came to her.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>She answered, "In the past, if the devil came to knock at my front door, as soon as he knocked, I would say, Don't come in. Don't come in.' But the result was always a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Now when the devil knocks at my door, I say, Lord, You open the door for me.'</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If the Lord opens the door, and the devil sees the Lord, he will say, Sorry, I came to the wrong door,' and he will run away."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we are tempted and say, "Lord, save me because temptation is coming my way again," the devil will come in even before the door is open.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We have to allow the Lord to handle the matter completely.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The more we pray, the more desperate we become, and the more we repeat our prayer, the harder it is to let go.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>A brother once said that when Peter was sinking, he only said, "Lord, save me."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Praying with a short sentence is letting go.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But if one continues to pray, "Lord, save me...," five or six times, he is already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>I call this kind of prayer a hangman's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is like a person who tries to hang himself a second and third time after having been unsuccessful the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When a person repeatedly prays this way, it shows that he has not let go.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He is trying to grasp victory with his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He is trying to overcome with his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Invariably, the result is defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If he did not pray so much, he might still have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Brothers and sisters, please remember that Satan is trying to make us move.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>As long as we move, even if it is by praying, he will have his way.</S>
