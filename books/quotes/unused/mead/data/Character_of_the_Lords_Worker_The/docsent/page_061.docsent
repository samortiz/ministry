   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another damaging effect of subjectivity is an inability to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A subjective person is very confident and clear about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has made up his mind about everything already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has formed an opinion about everything, and he is confident about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is difficult for him to learn anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When some young people first join the work, it is more difficult to teach them than it is to feed a child medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seems that some things almost have to be forced down their throat.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are full of ideas, proposals, and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They fancy that they know all there is to know.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although they dare not claim to be omniscient, they act as if they are omniscient.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is harder to teach them something than it is to feed them bitter medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man needs to be spoon-fed every meal, how long can he survive?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we meet some brothers, we cannot help but sigh in our heart, "My brother, how many things can a person like you learn from the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The biggest problem with a subjective person is his inability to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This one thing alone can cost him dearly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every time you want such a one to learn something, it seems as if you almost have to fight with him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may beat him down, and he may learn a little.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the next time you want him to learn something, you have to struggle with him all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a great frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One basic requirement of the Lord's worker is being able to remain objective; he has to be so objective that he can readily receive help from others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, our help comes from everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are so many things that we have to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose we only learn one lesson a month, or one lesson every half a year, or one lesson a year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How long can we live?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How many things can we learn in our lifetime?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A subjective person finds it harder to learn as the years go by.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His subjectivity increases as time goes by.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Indeed, subjectivity is a big problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is true that God's worker should be stable; his pathway should be straight and unwavering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if his opinions, views, and judgments are also set and unyielding, he will have very little chance of learning any lesson, and his usefulness will be very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, we need to be stable and unwavering before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, we cannot be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's children should learn to not be subjective; they should learn to be flexible for God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, it will be impossible for them to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to know whether or not a person is subjective, one only needs to find out whether he learns quickly or slowly, or if he can learn at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One can tell if a person is subjective by the amount of spiritual things he learns and how often he learns them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The obstacle to learning anything is subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Subjectivity affects a person's ability to learn; it even stops him from learning anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The basic requirement for spiritual advance is openness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our heart, mind, and spirit must be wide open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Being open to Him means that we are not subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The primary meaning of being open is not being subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of course, in order for our spirit to be open to God, something deeper than not being subjective is involved.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But not being subjective is the first condition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As soon as we are subjective, our gates are closed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not being subjective means that we are sensitive to God, that we can learn, and that we can receive impressions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is hard for many people to receive any impression from God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has to use a rod or a whip or even a hammer to hit such ones before they receive any impressions from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should learn to understand God's will as soon as His eyes turn.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people are like horses and mules, who do not understand anything unless they are led by the bit and bridle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is what it means to be subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A subjective person cannot pick up any signal from God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God may wrestle with him and allow him to come to a blind alley or a closed door, yet he is still arguing with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He cannot quiet himself down to learn what he should learn.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many people are not meek and pliable enough before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are too hard and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They become a stumbling block to the work because they have not learned much or received much supply from the Lord all their life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They become a problem and a loss to the work.</S>
