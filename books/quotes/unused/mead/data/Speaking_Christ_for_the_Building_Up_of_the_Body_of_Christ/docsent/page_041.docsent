   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE A CLOSING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fellowship in this chapter may be considered as advice, not as a charge or a law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to exercise much wisdom regarding the way we live our Christian life in our locality after we have seen the light concerning the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>NEVER IMPOSING THE NEW WAY ON OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>NOR PROMOTING IT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should neither impose the new way on others nor should we promote it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The best way to carry out the new way is to live as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes is altogether scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not believe that any of the saints would oppose this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is possible that some might not be happy to preach the gospel in this way, but we should not impose this on them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is up to the saints whether or not they would take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We trust in the Lord for His doing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ENDEAVORING TO PRACTICE THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AS THE LORD LEADS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>ACCORDING TO THE LIMIT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You also need to endeavor to practice the new way as the Lord leads according to the limit of the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may be in a local church which does not practice the preaching of the gospel by visiting people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, you should not impose this on others or promote it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the other hand, you can carry out your burden for this on your own.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You can follow the Lord s leading to fellowship with one or two others who would be burdened to go with you to preach the gospel according to the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord will surely lead you to some sons of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the old way, we were inviting the people, the fish, to come to us, and they would not answer our invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That was the reason we did not gain many people in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in the new way we are going to the fish, and we have the assurance in the Lord that we can gain some.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you can gain one new one every three months, you will gain four in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a good number.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But you have to consider how many new ones you and the other saints in your locality are able to take care of.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If six in a locality of only fifteen saints are burdened to preach the gospel by visiting people, they can gain twenty to thirty new ones in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, if they went out every week they could gain more, but I do not think that this is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we deliver many babies and are not able to care for them, this is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, we have to apportion our manpower and our time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The best way for us to take is to gain one or two new ones every three months.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we will reap some for each of the four seasons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we take care of them they will grow, and after a year they will be raised up to do what we are doing in the gospel service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we take this way quietly without promoting it or imposing it on anyone, we will not offend anyone or stir up different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must do our best not to stir up any turmoil, debate, or argument.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The saints will not oppose or criticize you if you preach the gospel by visiting people and set up weekly home meetings with the new ones that you gain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the church in your locality does not practice the new way, you should do your best to attend the regular meetings of the church, at least on the Lord s Day and if possible the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then you could reserve one evening a week to either preach the gospel or care for the new ones in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, these home meetings are church meetings in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do everything in your locality in a loving, nice, and wise way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what it means to practice the new way as the Lord leads according to the limit of the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>EXPRESSING THE LORD S</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>HUMILITY AND FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IN ANY STEP OF THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do everything in humility with forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Never do anything arrogantly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are doing a good work to preach the gospel and raise up the home meetings, we should not have a proud spirit or attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are living in and with the divine Trinity, none of us can be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We always have to be humble and forbearing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In any situation we should not overstep the limit the Lord has given us.</S>
