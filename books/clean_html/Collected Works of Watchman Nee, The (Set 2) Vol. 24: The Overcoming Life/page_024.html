<P>What is the cross? The cross signifies God's despair of man! The cross tells us that God has given up hope in man! What is the cross? The cross tells us that God is proclaiming, "I cannot improve man; I cannot correct him. I cannot make any headway with him. I can only crucify him on the cross." The strange thing is that we already know this fact. We already know that God considers us as being hopeless and that we deserve only to be crucified. But at the same time, we still think that we are not that bad. Therefore, we make resolutions every day. We say, "God, I promise that I will do this and that. From now on, I will no longer lose my temper." But none of these promises work. Sometimes we think that our resolutions are not strong enough, and we try to do a better job the next time. We make more resolutions, and after we lose our temper, we vow that we will not lose our temper the next time. But we find ourselves still losing it, and we make a third resolution. This was the way Paul lived: "For to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" (Rom. 7:18). He was always making resolutions, failing, making resolutions, and failing over and over again. This was not only Paul's life but the frequent experience of many of us today. Brothers and sisters, are we through making resolutions? God says that we only deserve to die and that we are absolutely useless. He says that there is no hope in us.</P><P>What does it mean to be crucified with Christ? It means that God has given up hope in us and that we have also given up hope in ourselves. For God to crucify us with Christ means that God has no further hope. For us to say that "I am crucified with Christ" means that we also have no further hope. God sees through our condition; He knows that we are completely useless and that there is no further hope in us. What does it mean to be crucified with Christ? It means that we have given up all hope. We admit that we can never please God. God can do nothing except put us to death. There is no hope in a man of flesh. The only thing left for us to do is die. We only deserve to die.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you have any sick persons in your home? I have been to five or six homes where the husband, wife, or children were sick. Whenever the family lost hope in a sick person, they would say, "Mr. Nee, if it be God's will, I hope he or she goes quickly." Why would they say this? They said it because they had no further hope. When all hope was lost, they wished that the sick one would die quickly. Now God is telling you that there is no further hope in you; He can only crucify you. It would be well if you could also say that there is no further hope in you and that the only way is to be crucified.</P><P>Our problem today is that we are very familiar with Romans 6, but we are still making resolutions like the person in Romans 7. We still make promises to God and still think that we are somewhat useful. Although we are very clear about Romans 6, we are behaving in the way of Romans 7. In Romans 6 God told Paul that he was useless. In Romans 7 Paul told himself that he was useless. Brothers and sisters, God is clear about us. He gave up hope on us long ago. According to God's evaluation we are not worth anything. He has already told us that we are useless. The question is how do we evaluate ourselves. If we also give up hope in ourselves and say that we are useless, we will experience deliverance immediately. God allows us to lose our temper, to be proud, jealous, and dishonest. He allows sin to turn us upside-down. This is His way of telling us that we cannot make it. But how do we respond? We think that our first resolution was not strong enough and that we have to make a stronger resolution. We think that it may work the second time. But it still does not work. This is the experience of Romans 7. Romans 6 is merely the teaching, whereas Romans 7 leads us into the reality of Romans 6.</P><P>If anyone here told me that I am hopelessly corrupt, I would shout, "Hallelujah! I, Watchman Nee, am hopelessly corrupt." Hallelujah! Paul could do nothing about himself. He suffered many years. He only deserved to be crucified. Today if you declare that you are no longer useful, you will experience deliverance immediately. Those who try to be good will never be saved. Similarly, Christians who resolve to be good Christians will never overcome. Brothers and sisters, God's cross has not misjudged you. Day after day, I love to do one thing: I love to declare that I was useless yesterday, that I am useless today, and that I will be useless tomorrow. I will be useless forever.</P><P>God wants us to accept the appraisal of the cross because by accepting the appraisal of the cross, we accept the Lord as our sanctification, perfection, and victory. If we still cherish some hope and still have a glimmer of faith in ourselves, God will have to continue His work on us. He will not stop operating in us until we completely lose hope in ourselves. God has to take us to the point that we have no hope in ourselves at all. He does this so that we will accept the cross. God is leading us to this point because He wants us to realize that we are not able in ourselves, and He wants us to acknowledge this.</P><P>Many people realize that they cannot do anything in themselves. However, they still have not overcome. Why? This happens because God also requires that we fulfill another condition.</P>
