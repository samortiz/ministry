   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LAMPSTANDS BEING FOR THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES A. Symbolizing the Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>as the Testimony of Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The lampstands in Revelation are the symbols of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every local church is a lampstand shining forth the testimony of Jesus with the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the lamps in its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Divine in Nature</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The lampstands are golden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we have seen, gold signifies the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That the lampstands here are golden signifies that the churches are constituted with the divine nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have the Father s life and nature 2 Pet 1:4 , the Father s gold, possessing His golden divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How wonderful that we have this divine substance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. Shining in the Dark Age</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>with the Seven Spirits of God</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may pay our attention only to the lampstands and neglect the lamps, but the lampstands are not for the lampstands; they are for the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the lampstands had no lamps, they would be meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we must point out what the lamps are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We see the lamps in chapter four: they are the seven Spirits of God burning before the throne 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the seven Spirits of God are the seven burning lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some have said that the lamps are Christ and that the church is the stand which holds Christ as the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not bad, but Revelation does not say that the lamp firstly is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, when we come to chapter twenty-one, we see that Christ is the lamp in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Revelation does not say that Christ is the seven lamps today; rather, it says that the seven Spirits of God are the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be deeply impressed with how much the seven Spirits mean to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are the churches as the lampstands, what should we hold?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To say that we should hold Christ is too doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Who and what is Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our experiences for the church life, Christ is not merely Christ He is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This Spirit, who is the life-giving Spirit, has been intensified in the book of Revelation into the seven Spirits which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These Spirits are the seven eyes, not only of God, but also of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church life is completely dependent upon these seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not a matter of Christ doctrinally, but of the seven Spirits experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must experience the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our work, daily life, meetings, service, and testimonies, we must have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we lack the Spirit, we are empty and are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The lampstands must hold the lamps which are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The seven Spirits are the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is clearly indicated by the lampstand in Exodus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This lampstand, which was one piece of gold weighing a talent, is expressed through the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This solid piece of pure gold signifies God the Father as our very substance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we only had God the Father, we would not have the form; we would have the gold, but no stand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To have only the Father without the Son is to have the substance without the embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only when the gold is beaten into the form of a stand do we have the embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While the stand is the embodiment of the substance, without the seven lamps, this embodiment cannot have its expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, the substance is the Father, the embodiment is the Son, and the expression is the Spirit expressing God the Father in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since all that God the Father is in the Son is expressed through the seven lamps, the Bible later tells us that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, the Spirit is the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, in the book of Revelation, we see that this expression is the expression of Christ, because the seven Spirits firstly were the seven eyes of God in Zechariah 4:10, and have become the seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The seven eyes of the Lamb are the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today, the Holy Spirit, who is the life-giving Spirit and also the seven Spirits, is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where is this expression today?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is with the churches, for the seven Spirits are the seven lamps held by the churches as the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many Christians today do not know the life-giving Spirit and the sevenfold intensified Spirit, or the seven Spirits as the expression of Christ held by the churches as the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you would meet this Spirit, you must be with the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you would touch, enjoy, and experience this Spirit, you must be a part of the church, for it is the churches as the lampstands which hold the seven Spirits of Christ who are the very expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This Spirit is no more separate from Christ than your eyes are separate from you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since a person s eyes are his expression, they cannot be separated from him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Likewise, since the seven Spirits are Christ s expression, they cannot be separated from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The churches are the lampstands, and the lamps are the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This light is shining brighter and brighter, and the vision is becoming clearer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The local churches as the golden lampstands shine with such a Spirit in the dark age of today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In today s dark age, the church really needs the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God to shine forth the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>D. The Church Being the Embodiment of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>and the Reproduction of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church is the embodiment of Christ and the reproduction of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Spirit is the reality of Christ John 14:17-20; 16:13-15 , and the church is the reproduction of the Spirit Rev 22:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church with the Spirit is the embodiment of Christ, the testimony of Jesus Rev 1:2, 9; 19:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, the more Spirit, the more church and the more testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>THE TWO LAMPSTANDS FOR GOD S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>IN THE GREAT TRIBULATION</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In 11:4 we see the two lampstands, the two witnesses, for God s testimony during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The overcomers will be raptured before the tribulation, whereas the weaker ones, the green and tender ones, will be left on earth to pass through the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Due to this, there will be the need for the strengthening of God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To meet this need, God will send Elijah and Moses back to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Today, the testimony of the church mainly depends upon the stronger, more experienced ones.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the experienced ones have been raptured, the weaker ones will need to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although it may be quite good to be supplied by Moses and Elijah, I want to leave the earth before they return.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In principle, the two witnesses in chapter eleven also are lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Bible describes them as the two olive trees which supply oil to the weaker ones Zech 4:3, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>According to the parable of the ten virgins in Matthew 25, the five foolish virgins will need to buy oil.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Once Brother Nee said that probably these foolish virgins would go to the two olive trees to gain the extra portion of the Spirit at a cost.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>These two olive trees are also called the two sons of oil, for they are full of the Spirit for God s testimony Zech 4:14 and are able to supply the weaker saints.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>During the great tribulation, many of the unripe ones will be strengthened and matured through their ministry.</S>
