<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SECOND OF THE THREE ROUNDS IN THE DEBATES<br>BETWEEN JOB AND HIS THREE FRIENDS<br>CHAPTERS 12&#151;20</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JOB'S SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, ACCUSATION,<br>AND ARGUMENTS<br>AND<br>ELIPHAZ'S REBUKE AND WARNING</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 12&#151;13</H1><P>In this message we will begin to consider Job's superiority complex, accusation against his friends, and arguments with God. This is followed by Eliphaz's rebuke and warning.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JOB'S SUPERIORITY COMPLEX, ACCUSATION,<br>AND ARGUMENTS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Job's Superiority Complex<br>in the Matter of Knowing God</H2><P>In 12:1&#151;13:2 we see Job's superiority complex in the matter of knowing God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Claiming That<br>He Was Not Inferior to His Friends</H2><P>Considering himself the righteous man, the perfect man, who called out to God, Job claimed that he was not inferior to his friends, who had made him a laughingstock. They were at ease and contemned calamity, not knowing that the tents of robbers prosper and that those who provoke God and carry their god in their own might have security (12:1-6). This word is about the supposed prosperity in doing good and suffering in doing evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Contemning His Friends<br>and Asking Them to Learn of the Beasts,<br>of the Birds, of the Earth, and of the Fish</H2><P>Job contemned his friends and asked them to learn of the beasts, of the birds of heaven, of the earth, and of the fish of the sea, all of which know that Jehovah made them and that in His hand is the life of every living thing and the spirit of all flesh of man. Yet his friends were inferior to the ear that tries words and to the palate that tastes food (vv. 7-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Boasting of His Superior and Broader Knowledge of God</H2><P>Finally, Job boasted of his superior and broader knowledge of God (12:12&#151;13:2). Job declared that with God are wisdom and might, that God controls what happens on earth, and that God rules over the nations, making nations great and destroying them. His speaking in 12:12-25 indicates that he was quite knowledgeable. Then as a concluding word he said to his friends, "Behold, my eye has seen all this;/My ear has heard and understood it./What you know, I also know;/I am not inferior to you" (13:1-2). This surely is a sign of Job's superiority complex.</P>
