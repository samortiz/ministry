John's purpose in writing is to let those who believe into the name of the Son of God know that they have eternal life
If we know the way of justification and the forgiveness of sins, we will know whether or not we have passed that way
God has given His only begotten Son to the world, and Jesus has died for sinners and accomplished the work of redemption
The great result is too good; it is something man has never thought of: whoever believes will not perish, but have eternal life
He loved to the extent that He gave His only begotten Son to the world to die on the cross for men's sins and save all the sinners
We discussed it from nine o'clock in the evening to half past eleven o'clock, but the matter was still not settled
He said, 'Three months ago, someone came here to preach the gospel and said that those who believe have eternal life
They think that all the misconduct in the past is put on Jesus, but that if one misbehaves after he has believed, he will perish
Today many do not have the joy of salvation because they are trying to preserve their ongoing salvation with good works
