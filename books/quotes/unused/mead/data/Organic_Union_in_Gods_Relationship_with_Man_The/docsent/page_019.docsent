   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through the All-inclusive Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His salvation He has redeemed us from our sinfulness and has terminated us in our sinful constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Redemption, forgiveness, justification, and reconciliation are all included in His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were sinners and enemies toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We were sinners not merely by committing sins; we were sinners by constitution Rom 5:19; 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We became a constitution of sin and were the totality of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we needed not only to be forgiven but also to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ's death on the cross did a wonderful job of terminating our sinful constitution and taking away all our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based on such a death we have redemption and forgiveness, and as God's enemies we were reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now there is no contradiction between us and God; the situation between us and God has been altogether appeased.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is satisfied with the all-inclusive death of Christ, and this death also has satisfied us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now we can thank Him for His all-inclusive death that has terminated our sinful constitution and has redeemed us from our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through such a redemption we have been forgiven, and God has justified us and even reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In such a situation the problem between us and God has been fully cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unto the Dynamic Salvation of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, at this juncture this dear One as the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the pneumatic Christ and the consummation of the Triune God, entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we, the poor sinners and the enemies of God, have become such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The entire Triune God with all His processes has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This One is our Savior, our Lord, our Master, our God, our Father, and our all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now He remains in us, abides in us 1 John 3:24b , lives in us Gal 2:20a , is being formed in us 4:19 , and is making His home in our hearts Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, He is transforming us and conforming us to His image 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:29 , making us the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ultimately, He will glorify us with Himself as the glory Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In such a salvation, He is our everything and we are His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He and we, we and He, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We abide in Him and He abides in us John 15:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We coinhere with Him: He lives in us and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We and He are one person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are we men or are we God?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, we are both.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are we divine or merely human?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are both; we are humanly divine and divinely human.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are human beings, and we are also divine beings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are in the pneumatic Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God and the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only so, the Triune God, Christ, and the consummated, compound Spirit are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not need to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Heaven is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Heaven has come down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not love heaven, but we love the very Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is much better than heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I assure you that where Christ is, heaven is there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not need to worry about heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We simply need to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are in heaven because we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is our heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because of such a salvation, we are buoyant; we would never be down but would always be up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Six thousand years ago God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He waited four thousand years, and then He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then, in the next two thousand years He made man one with Him practically.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today we are here as God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hell is under our feet, and the lake of fire is far away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because we are in Him, wherever He is, is heaven to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is buoyant, and we are buoyant in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our sinful constitution has been terminated, and we have been redeemed from our sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, there is no problem between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have been justified by God and reconciled to God, and we are in an absolutely peaceful condition and situation with God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Based on this, we can enjoy Him, and He can flood into us to be our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is God's salvation, and this is the dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At times we may feel weak, dying, or even dead, but He is the resurrecting life John 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This resurrecting life counters our weakness and our deadness 2 Cor 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In ourselves we may become fatigued, weak, and dead; but He is in us as the resurrecting life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He resurrects us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God's salvation is nothing but God Himself making Himself our contents and making us a part of Him in the divine organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's salvation is the saving God Himself plus His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The redeeming and saving God Himself is our dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the heavenly view that we all need to see.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>With such a view, when we come to the Bible, it will become a new book to us.</S>
