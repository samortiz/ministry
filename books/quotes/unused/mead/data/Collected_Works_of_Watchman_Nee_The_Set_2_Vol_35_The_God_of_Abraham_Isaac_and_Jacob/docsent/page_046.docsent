   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE OF PENIEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God met him that night.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This place was called Peniel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was the place where Jacob's fleshly life was exhausted and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God Wrestling with Jacob</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this place Jacob was not doing something; he was not praying or wrestling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, God came and wrestled with Jacob; God came and subdued him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What does it mean to wrestle?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Wrestling means to press someone down.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God wrestled with Jacob in order to subdue him, strip him of his strength, and pin him down so that he could not struggle any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The meaning of wrestling is to deplete someone of his strength, bring him down, and pin him down.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It means to subdue someone and then to keep him down with power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible shows us that God wrestled with Jacob and did not prevail over him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jacob was indeed strong!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the significance of God being unable to prevail over Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we do not trust in God and when we contrive by ourselves and are satisfied with ourselves, we have to admit that God cannot prevail over us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we try to do God's will by our own strength and try to deliver ourselves by all kinds of natural means, we have to say that God has not prevailed over us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many brothers and sisters have believed in the Lord for many years, but they have to admit that God has never prevailed over them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are still very clever, strong, capable, and resourceful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is not able to prevail over them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They have never been subdued by God and have never been defeated by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If they had been defeated by God, they would have said, "I cannot make it!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God, I surrender!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is unfortunate that many brothers and sisters have been under God's discipline repeatedly and still are not defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They think that they did not plan well enough the first time, and that they have to design a better plan the second or third time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such ones have never been defeated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jacob was a person who would never suffer a defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He knew that this was a critical moment for him, but he still had his own ways.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He might have thought, "I know Esau very well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I do this, there is a ninety-nine percent chance that I will succeed."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although he was afraid in his heart, he was still very resourceful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many people have repeatedly experienced God's discipline, but their natural life has never been dealt with in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, they make God's discipline their boast in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They think that by experiencing God's discipline frequently, they are accumulating a rich spiritual history for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they had never been dealt with by the Lord, they would have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They would not be able to take pride in any spiritual thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The only thing they could take pride in would be the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when they have had a little experience of fellowshipping with God and received some dealings, they adorn themselves with these fragmented dealings and use them as the basis for their spiritual boast and claim that they know God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brothers and sisters, perhaps God has been wrestling with you for five or ten years but has not yet prevailed over you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have not yet been brought to the point where you say, "I am finished.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I cannot stand up any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I cannot make it."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that God has not yet prevailed over you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God Touching the Hollow of Jacob's Thigh</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thank God that He has a way!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is true that Jacob was very capable and that his fleshly life and natural energy were stronger than anyone else's. But in the end God prevailed over him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God had wrestled with him according to the usual way, the wrestling might have lasted for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But God knew that the time had come.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When He saw that Jacob could not be put down, He touched the hollow of his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once God touched the hollow of his thigh, it came out of joint.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The sinew of the hollow of the thigh is the strongest sinew in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It represents the strongest part of a person, the seat of man's natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God touched the seat of Jacob's natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh because on that day, the sinew of it was revealed and exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On that day, he was afraid that Esau would come and kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was afraid that his wives and children would be killed by his brother, and therefore, he put on the best performance of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He prepared his gifts, put some of each kind in each company, and asked the servants to walk in front and separate the companies by a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He also told them to speak good words when they met Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He came up with this smart way of mitigating Esau's animosity so that Esau would feel obliged to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Jacob was putting his best ability forward; the sinew of the hollow of his thigh was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But that day God touched the hollow of his thigh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Man's natural strength always exhibits certain characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are always certain areas from which the natural strength manifests itself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There are always certain spots which are particularly strong.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God intends to expose these strong spots.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Unfortunately, many Christians do not know the vehicles upon which their natural energy is lodged.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The most pitiful people are not those who are weak, but those who do not know that they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The poorest people are not those who are wrong, but those who do not know that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They are not only in error but in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They do not live in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As a result they are not aware of their wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some Christians can say that they are wrong in this and that, but the wrongs they mention are actually not the crux of the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There may be deeper problems which are not yet manifested, and God has not yet been provided the opportunity to expose them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God permitted Jacob to encounter Esau with the four hundred men so that all of Jacob's strength would be exposed and his characteristics revealed.</S>
