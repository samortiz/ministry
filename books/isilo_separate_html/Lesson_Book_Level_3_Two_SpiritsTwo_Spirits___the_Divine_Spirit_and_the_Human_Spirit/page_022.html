As Wind for Power</H2><P>[The Lord's word to the disciples concerning the Holy Spirit in chapter one of Acts was fulfilled in chapter two. On the day of Pentecost "suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind," and it filled the house where the disciples were sitting. Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4). On the day of the Lord's resurrection the disciples received the Holy Spirit as breath for life. Then fifty days later, on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples as a rushing mighty wind. We can easily see the difference between breath and wind. Breath is for life, and wind is for power. In John 20 and Acts 2 we have two symbols of the Holy Spirit: the breath for life inwardly and the wind for power outwardly.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In the Life and Ministry of the Lord Jesus</H2><P>[With the Lord Jesus we also see these two aspects of the Holy Spirit. First, the Lord was conceived of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18,20). Then at the age of thirty, when He came forth to minister, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him, and He was baptized in the Holy Spirit (Luke 3:21-22). The Lord's being conceived of the Spirit was a matter of the Spirit essentially, but His being baptized in the Holy Spirit was a matter of the Spirit descending upon Him economically. Hence, the Holy Spirit for the Lord's conception was essential, whereas the Holy Spirit for His ministry was economical.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. ONLY ONE SPIRIT</H2><P>[It is important for us to differentiate these two aspects of the Spirit, for then we shall understand the Gospels and Acts in the right way. Otherwise, we shall be confused.]</P><P>On one point, however, we must be very clear: [We should not think that there are two Spirits or that the Spirit can somehow be divided. On the contrary, there is one Spirit. Yet there are the two aspects of the Spirit, one aspect for essence and another aspect for economy. The first aspect of the Spirit is essential; the second aspect is economical. Today in our experience we have both aspects of the Holy Spirit. We have both the essential Spirit and the economical Spirit.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE PROPER AIM&#151;<br>OUTWARD POWER FOR INWARD LIFE</H2><P>We must also be clear that the outward, economical aspect is not the aim; the economical is for the essential. [The outward aspect of power is always for the sake of the inward aspect of life. It is by the inward that God's desire, God's central aim is fulfilled. The outward aspect is the means of accomplishing the inward aspect. In 1 Corinthians 12:13, we have these two aspects mentioned in the proper order. We were "baptized" first, and we were made to "drink" second. After we have been baptized in the Spirit into one Body, we must drink of the Spirit that we may grow in life and be built up in the Body. To be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be put into Him, just as to be baptized in water is to be put into it. But to drink of the Holy Spirit is to take Him into us just as to drink water is to take it into us. Baptism is outward and drinking is inward. The outward baptism is for the inward drinking.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>[The outward aspect of the Holy Spirit's work is mostly included in the baptism in the Holy Spirit. There are five historical cases of the outpouring of the Spirit recorded in Acts. Only two are called the baptism in the Holy Spirit: the outpouring at the Day of Pentecost in Acts 2 for the Jewish believers and the outpouring in the house of Cornelius in Acts 10 for the Gentile believers. Acts 1:5 and 11:15-17 verify this fact. In these two instances, Christ as the Head baptized the Jewish and Gentile parts of His Body in the Holy Spirit once and for all. By so doing, He has fully accomplished the baptism in the Holy Spirit upon His entire Body.]</P><P>[The other three, the cases of the Samaritan believers, Saul of Tarsus, and the twelve believers in Ephesus, are all considered extraordinary, needing some members of the Body of Christ to identify them with the Body by the laying on of hands. Besides these five cases, in many cases of conversion, such as the three thousand (2:41), the five thousand (4:4), the Ethiopian eunuch (8:36, 38-39a), the many who believed in Antioch (11:20-21, 24), the many cases in chapters thirteen and fourteen under Paul's preaching ministry, Lydia in Philippi (16:14-15), the jailer in Philippi (16:33), the believers in Thessalonica (17:4), the believers in Berea (17:10-12), the believers in Athens (17:34), the ruler of the synagogue and many other believers in Corinth (18:8), and the believers in Ephesus (19:18-19), there is no mention of the believers' receiving the Holy Spirit economically&#151;the Holy Spirit's falling upon the believers&#151; because in all these cases the believers were brought into the Body of Christ through their believing in a normal way, and they had no particular reason for some member of the Body of Christ to bring them into the identification with the Body by the laying on of hands. According to the principle of God's New Testament economy, they all should have received the Holy Spirit essentially for life and economically for power in a normal way through their believing into Christ.]</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
