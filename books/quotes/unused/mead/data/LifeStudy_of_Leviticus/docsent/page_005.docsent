   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A COMPARISON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now go on to make a comparison between certain aspects of Exodus and Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. God Speaking on Mount Sinai and God Speaking in the Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are some significant differences between Exodus and Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first difference we would point out concerns the place of God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Exodus God spoke on Mount Sinai, which is a bare mountain; in Leviticus God speaks in the tabernacle, which is a building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At this point we need to ask a question: Where is God in the book of Leviticus?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis God, generally speaking, was in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At times He came to earth for a visit, but then He returned to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Exodus God was on Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Leviticus God is in the tabernacle, in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Genesis God was in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Exodus God came down to stay on Mount Sinai to do a work to build up His habitation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the last chapter of Exodus, the tabernacle was erected, and the furniture was arranged within it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then God came into the tabernacle to dwell in it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now in Leviticus God is in the tabernacle, which is the tent of meeting, and speaks in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first and last verses of Leviticus indicate that the entire book is a record of God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The speaking that began in 1:1 took place not in the heavens nor on Mount Sinai but in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's speaking today is also in His tabernacle, and this tabernacle is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the principle of the typology here, God speaks in the church as His tabernacle, the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This tent of meeting is the oracle, the place of God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the church God is always speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The extent to which a congregation is the church actually and practically depends on how much of God's speaking is there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a certain group does not have God's speaking, it is hard to regard such a group as a church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to typology, where the tent of meeting was, there was God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children of Israel camped in thousands of tents, but God's speaking was only in one tent, a unique tent the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The one sign of the tent of meeting was God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The tent itself and all its furnishings could be copied or imitated, but this is not true of God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's speaking cannot be imitated, copied, or duplicated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many things in the church can be imitated, copied, or duplicated by others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But one thing cannot be imitated, and that is God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's speaking is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It depends solely on God and not on man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose that one day Aaron became unhappy with Moses, who was taking the lead in the tent of meeting, and gathered a group of Israelites and made another tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In every respect Aaron's tabernacle was a duplicate of the original.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In color, material, design, and workmanship the two tabernacles were identical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you had been there, to which tabernacle would you have gone to the one set up by Moses or to the one set up by Aaron?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You might say, "I would never go to Aaron's tabernacle; I would only go to Moses' tabernacle."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This answer is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The correct way to answer this question is to say, "I would never go to a tabernacle where there is not God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I would go only to the tabernacle where God speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, I would not go to a tabernacle I would go to God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without God's speaking, the tabernacle means nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The preciousness of the tabernacle was not the gold in it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There was more gold in Egypt than in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The preciousness of the tabernacle was God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The same is true of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The preciousness of the church is God's speaking or, as it may be better to say, the speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise the Lord that in the church we have God's speaking!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This speaking is a treasure to us.</S>
