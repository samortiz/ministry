The following suggestions to Bible teachers are the result of years of prayerful thinking and careful testing in various Bible classes
Lead them to see that He was as perfect as complete before Creation as after that His creative acts did not add to His uncreated perfection
Lead the class to see that Uncreated Life has no beginning and no end; that it is self-existent and unchangeable
Suggest the thought of the impossibility of God's creating the universe without a definite purpose concerning each atom of the same
Enlarge upon the thought that God created the universe because He wished it created, and He created it as He wished it to be
That the Celestial heaven with its inhabitants was created before the earth we may discover as we read Job 38:4-7
A close study of God's Word seems to indicate that to Lucifer had been given dominion over the earth and its surrounding atmosphere, i
Never had those words been uttered before, for this was the origin of sin, and in Lucifer, we behold the first sinner
Let the members of the class turn to 1 John 3:4 and compare with the Revised Version which renders 'transgression,' lawlessness
Ask the class to read these two remarkable passages, Isaiah 14:12-15 and Ezekiel 28:12-19, carefully many times
The question may be asked How could this bright anointed cherub created without iniquity and having no being to tempt him become a sinner
The bright anointed one contemplated his beauty, his wisdom, his brightness-the gifts of God-instead of God Himself
Alas, does not this show us that self-contemplation, even the contemplation of those gifts bestowed upon us by God, is dangerous?
Limited to that portion of the universe that had been entrusted to him, he must be permitted to enter upon his independent rulership
The result of Satan's first experience in independent rulership is shown in verse 2 of the first chapter of Genesis
Let us read it as found in the Rotherham translation of the Old Testament, which more clearly follows the Hebrew than does the A
The bright anointed cherub had demonstrated very clearly his inability to exercise independent government even in his own dominion
The glacial period and ice age are indicated in the account of the ruin as stated in so few words in the verse that we have been considering
He formed it to be inhabited'; therefore now that it had been made empty and desolate, He patiently undertakes the work of reconstruction
In addition there are in the building of the tree force and law; it is force that does the building; it is law that governs the building
Unless the thought is expressed in spoken, written or printed word, it will remain in my mind unperceived by my friend
The inner man was in some way created like God; we may reverently say, patterned after Him; yet how and to what extent we need to understand
We have said that all of God's activities are for the realization of a well-defined purpose which shall completely satisfy His heart
Unable to share His Nature it follows that they would never be able to return the Uncreated Love of sons which alone would satisfy His heart
Explain that the circle upon the card containing the symbol of Created human life denotes man's endless existence
The second is found in Genesis 2:7, 'formed'-the Hebrew word yatsar, meaning to mold as a potter does the clay
The third is found in Genesis 1:27, 'created': The Hebrew bara signifies to call into existence that which has had no previous existence
In Isaiah 43:7 we find these three verbs used as in this account of man's creation that we have been considering
Explain that the spirit is the seat of Godconsciousness the soul the seat of selfconsciousness and the body of world or senseconsciousness
To illustrate, the spirit may be compared to the mistress; the soul, to the housekeeper; the body, to the servant
Before proceeding to the next subject, let us consider what wonderful beings came into existence when God created the first human pair
We read in Genesis 2:8, 'The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had created'
, shade trees-indicating that God delights to gratify the perception of beauty with which He has endowed man-and trees 'good for food,' i
Evidently these last named trees have some other use than to furnish food for the body or emotional satisfaction to the soul of man
Apparently it is the bright-hued serpent twining around the only object in the garden concerning which God had imposed prohibitive commands
We must look elsewhere, then, for the real but invisible tempter who is using the serpent as his mouthpiece, his tool
Is there any other human being present, who, for some subtle reason, is striving to lead Adam and Eve to disobey God's commands?
Would God tempt them to do that which He had expressly commanded them not to do, and the fatal results of which He well knew?
Only the angelic plane; therefore we conclude that the invisible tempter is an angel and evidently an angelic being of high rank
The same attitude of assumed equality with God is indicated; the same wilful disregard of His Sovereign commands
The scene is the wonderful garden of God with its waving trees, fragrant flowers, sparkling water and every object of natural beauty
He has planned deliberately and well concerning every detail of this decisive moment in the history of the human race
He has selected the most peculiarly striking member of the animal creation to attract the attention of Eve and to serve as his spokesman
Her addition to God's prohibition, expressed in the words 'neither shall ye touch it,' reveals the state of her mind
Her purpose to obey was so strong that she would not even touch the forbidden object; doubtless she would not fix her gaze upon it
Now for the first time, the thought of disobedience to God's command is presented to her mind and finds lodgment there
Yet so subtle is the working of the tempter, that eating of the forbidden fruit does not seem to be direct disobedience
Is an eye of a human being, seemingly perfect in structure, wide open, apparently able to see any object placed before it
Upon the very day of Adam and Eve's disobedience, sin severed the delicate intuitive knowledge of God in the spirit of Adam and Eve
We see that a human being may be moral, educated, refined, strong and vigorous in mind and body, yet dead to God
The bodies so wonderfully formed of the dust of the earth and which might have been glorified, now returned to dust
We now need to notice a phrase used several times in the account of the creative work of God as found in the first chapter of Genesis
God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind'
His creative power brought into being these various forms of life, and their reproduction is but an extension of His creative act
Many have been the attempts to prove the theory of 'spontaneous generation,' but these attempts have resulted in complete failure
We see from what we have considered, how impossible it is for life on one plane to generate life on another plane
All that any life-principle can do is to bring to manifestation and maturity the life on that particular plane; e
In other words, the bird may spread its wings and fly far up in the air; it may sing its sweetest song; but it can never generate human life
Before proceeding to another subject the teacher will do well to review what has already been presented in reference to sin
In reference to the last clause, explain that the awful words of judgment uttered by God to the first sinner cannot be forgotten by him
Satan remembers them well and he fears exceedingly; yet he is ever seeking to prevent the complete execution of the sentence of doom
The result of Satan's sin in connection with the earthly sphere over which he had been given dominion, was a disordered, chaotic earth
God has sustained because He had a purpose concerning the human race and a plan to be worked out in this sin-cursed world
As we carefully ponder these words we find that two figures are employed the architectural and the parental and they are peculiarly blended
Biologically it is an impossibility for we know that life on each plane can only reproduce itself it cannot generate life on a higher plane
Science agrees perfectly with the Bible in declaring that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit
Do not permit them to indulge in the weak, illogical reasoning of many persons who say that 'God is too loving to punish sinners'
Is it lack of love in God that permits a person to fall when he has thrown himself over the edge of a precipice?
God can never be anything else than holy; man can never be anything else than sinful, in his natural condition
Let us bear in mind that the word judgment in the Scriptures is used in this vindicatory sense, rather than in the vindictive
With this explanation in mind let us consider what the judgment in connection with the opposing claims of Gods holiness and His love will be
His fine sense of honesty recoils from further intimacy with the man, but his love suffers keenly over such a break in friendship
At this point the teacher should call attention to the first word in the Bible in reference to this unique personality
The fact that no human father is indicated and that this seed is to 'crush' the head of Satan, would argue that He was to be a super-man
In Isaiah 7:14 we read these words: 'Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel'
Unto us a child is born but notice carefully the next phraseA son is given not born implying that His origin is above the plane of humanity
Notice the name given Him: 'The Wonderful Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace'
No wonder that the angels shouted for joy, for God had clothed Himself with humanity, that He might redeem a sinful human race
Point to the white circles as symbolizing His humanity, and make clear to the class that He really partook of our human nature
It will be very helpful if the contrast between the temptation scene in the Garden of Eden and that in the wilderness is shown
Right here explain to the class the meaning of dominion as used in this connection, for the subject is little understood
He saw the result of man's sin before He created him and assumed the responsibility incurred in creating a being with the power of choice
Otherwise the execution of God's wonderful plan for the redemption of the human race will fail to be appreciated in its completeness
Let the following passages now be read to prove the foregoing statements: 2 Corinthians 5:19; 1 Timothy 3:16; Acts 20:28, last phrase
We are now able to better understand those passages that speak of 'the Lamb foreordained before the foundation of the world'
Truly, 'the atonement in principle and in God is dateless, but as taking effect on man it is historical though dateless'
Is it not reasonable to believe that the Lord God instructed Adam to kill a lamb to provide the necessary covering?
As he proceeds to fashion from its skin the covering necessitated by his sin, does he need to be told the meaning of this sacrificial death?
Is it not altogether probable that the promised 'seed of the woman' was now associated with the slain lamb in the mind of Adam?
It signifies the 'Self-Existent One who reveals Himself'; or the Manifested God; therefore indicates the Eternal Son
Elohim is a plural noun indicating God in His complete threefoldness, as shown in Genesis 1:26, 'Let us make,' etc
; 'Yahweh Elohim,' as used in this passage and at least one other , indicates this same plural form, as shown by the personal pronoun us
Idolatry and wickedness of every kind brought disaster to the nation yet Gods word concerning the promised Redeemer was literally fulfilled
All through the earthly ministry of the God-Man, Satan sought to hinder, to render inoperative, to prevent the work given Him to do
In the garden of Gethsemane, Satan sought to take away that life which the God-Man had said He was to 'lay down of Himself' for His sheep
We have already spoken of the manifestation of God's Love and Holiness in redeeming the human race as one decisive act
The question might be asked, 'How could He deal judicially with sinners of all ages and dispensations in a moment of time'?
Only by dealing with their Federal Head, whose representative acts they would individually ratify through their power of choice
Representatively then, He must bear the stroke, the doom, the penalty that the sinful race deserved-that God's Holiness demanded
The Passover lambs were offered on Jewish altars, but death by crucifixion is not a Jewish mode of putting to death
Note: The teacher who would look into this subject would do well to obtain a copy of The Gospel in the Stars by Seiss
The longer of these extended vertically the length of the body; the shorter was placed horizontally from side to side
Startling indeed to our eyes would be the resemblance, although we cannot tell what impression was made upon the people of old
Scofield adds, 'When it is remembered that crucifixion was a Roman, not Jewish form of execution, the proof of inspiration is irresistible'
Arrange the various utterances of Christ upon the Cross in their order and meditate long and prayerfully upon their meaning
As verse 6 is read let the teacher place a black disc with circular opening, over the star upon the cardboard symbol of 'The God-Man'
Explain that sin could not be placed upon His essential Deity, but that His humanity was brought into the world for this very purpose
The latter expression was natural to His sinless humanity, but now He is uttering the cry of a race of sinners separated from a holy God
It was at this moment that He was tasting death for every man and death let us remember is a falling out of correspondence with environment
We can never fathom the mystery of that awful hour when God, in Christ, manifested His Suffering Love and Holiness
God has created us with a capacity for vicarious suffering upon a lower plane, that helps us to faintly appreciate this hour of agony
How often has this been true of a godly father or mother who has suffered agony over the wrongdoing of a wayward child?
Notice that three times in Isaiah 53 we find the word soul used in connection with the suffering of the Redeemer
Very appropriate then, is its use in this passage-for His whole personality felt the awful shock of contact with sin
Impress upon the class that the vicarious suffering which brought us Redemption took place in the inner man of the human nature of our Lord
No wonder that the forces of nature responded to the awful conflict that was taking place in the invisible realm
The statement 'came there forth blood and water' indicates a ruptured heart; but there are other indications also
In the light of this knowledge of the physical cause of Jesus' death, how increasingly sacred does the garden of Gethsemane scene become
Still the agony increased and great drops of bloody perspiration fell to the ground and death seemed near; yet He must go to the Cross
Those hands that had touched the leper the blind the deaf the dumb the diseased hang limply at His side as the body is lifted from the Cross
That voice that had stilled the waves, cast out demons, raised the dead, uttered words of Life and hope, is now still
Had Pilate cared to place an inscription upon the stone, he would have written, 'Here lies Jesus, King of the Jews'
Rather should they be clearly shown that when the stroke fell on Him, they were executed; when He suffered death, they died in Him
The stroke fell upon Him and upon all whom He embraced and as sinners the entire human race disappeared from the horizon of Gods holiness
She believed the facts as stated in the written Word of God, but her sense of justice said, 'I ought to be punished for my sin
When we say Christ died for me we refer to an element of His death that we could not share this is the Substitutionary Aspect of His death
Let us again recall the definition of death as stated in our earlier lessons: 'Death is a falling out of correspondence with environment'
We are now able to perceive that something more than the death of Christ is needed to meet all the requirements of God's Plan of Redemption
Accordingly, upon the third day after the body of Jesus had been placed in the tomb, the stone was found rolled away
Those nail-scarred hands are the same that ministered in blessing to the sick and needy, yet their earthiness has disappeared
The disciples gaze upon their glorified Lord in amazement and awe, yet He convinces them that He is the 'very same Jesus'
The star, denoting the Deity of the God-Man, is now seen over the gilt disc that symbolizes His glorified humanity
God has corroborated the statement of Jesus upon the Cross- 'It is finished,' by the display of His Resurrection and Ascension Power
If we study the derivation of the verb to appropriate, we shall find that it indicates the act of taking something for one's own use
The mental picture is an outstretched hand receiving something that has been given, to be put to a certain definite use
In answering this question, we must again call attention to the representative aspect of Christ's Death and Resurrection
Positionally, every redeemed human being arose when Christ arose; thus manifesting His victory over sin and death
The teacher must lead the class to see that God does not have to wait for the historical manifestation of anything before He sees it
Notice that 'He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before Him'
Have the class read 1 John 5:11 and then fasten a small gilt disc containing these words, upon the large disc symbolizing Uncreated Life
We found in a previous lesson that the threefoldness of God is to be considered in connection with every act of God
Before the sinner wakes up to grace out of the world of chaos in which he has been living, an uneasiness comes over him
They must see that in the very nature of things, repentance, as has been defined, is an act that can never be repeated
At the right of the Cross a gilt disc should be placed, above which are the words 'Sphere of Eternal Life in Christ Jesus'
A child may disobey its father's commands, may grieve his heart and wander away from him, but he is still his father's child
Before his new birth his standing was that of a sinner; now it is that of a child of God-in New Testament terms, a 'saint'
An illustration may help the class to perceive that justification does not depend upon our righteous acts but upon our attitude toward God
In Tennyson's poem, The Beggar Maid, we find that king Cophetua made the barefooted beggar girl in poor attire, his queen
Her standing before her marriage to the king was that of a poor beggar maid; upon her marriage she was at once a queen
A circle surrounds us, but only on one plane; but a sphere encompasses, envelops us, surrounding us in every direction
If you draw a circle on the floor, and step within its circumference you are within it only on the level of the floor
If that circle could become a sphere and you within it it would on every side surround youabove and below on the right hand and on the left
These two expressions, 'In Christ Jesus' and 'Christ in you,' or their equivalents, indicate the whole gospel story
The teacher will now need to call attention to God's ultimate purpose concerning the life of the regenerated one
We have already seen that God marked out the redeemed before the founding of the world to be conformed to the Image of His Son
In other words, it will ultimately manifest all the characteristic qualities of the individual life- principle
An invisible life-principle within each germ fashions the particular form of vegetable life that the Creator designs
To illustrate: The lily life is in the tiny green shoot appearing above the ground but it is not conformed to its type
There comes a day when the beautiful lily life is fully manifested in the lovely, fragrant blossoms that crown its glossy, green stalk
It makes no difference whether it be upon the plane of vegetable, animal or human life; if conditions are fulfilled, conformity is certain
The lily simply bathes in the sunshine, drinks in the rain and the dew, and absorbs from the soil that which it needs
Animal life is conscious life, although not self-conscious life; therefore the response to the provision for growth is of a different kind
Unlike the lily, they are created with organs of locomotion, and they must use them if they are to attain maturity of growth
He simply uses his God-given power of choice in such a manner that the life-principle within succeeds in causing conformity to type
We must now see how this law of conformity to type is manifested on the higher plane of regenerated human life
If the conditions for growth are fulfilled, then conformity to the Type-the Glorified God-Man-will be realized
The members of the human race must come into such a union with Him, that His death should be their death, and His Life their Life
Your old self was nailed there with Him; with Him it was laid in the tomb, and that was its termination; for only the Life of Christ arose
A still larger symbol, of the same shape, may be added later to illustrate the progressive stages of Transformation, if desired
The immediate results outwardly need to be carefully watched, as the temptations of Satan are very subtle at this point
It is owing to this fact that we see many persons manifesting their joy by singing, praising God, clapping of hands, etc
Satan seeks to imitate the Holy Spirit and to produce manifestations which he would have the person believe to be of God
Seventh: There is power in prayer and service because the believer is reckoning upon his identification with Christ who has 'all power'
Much of the activity of Christians is of a soulish nature, that a truly spiritual person is rarely seen, and when seen is not understood
One of the secondary evidences of the Holy Spirit's control of the believer is this illumination concerning the soulish life
A moment by moment faith in a moment by moment Savior, for a moment by moment cleansing, and a moment by moment filling
Many Christians fail at this point because they do not plainly see that the victory over Satan really has been won
Well has Andrew Murray expressed the truth, when he says, 'In the invisible world the Cross is the symbol of victory'
Although utterly defeated, Satan has sought to keep human beings in ignorance of his defeat, that he may still hold them in his power
We must remember that Satan is not omnipotent, omniscient, nor omnipresent, since these are attributes of Deity alone
He would like to have us think that he possesses the attributes of Deity and many Christians speak as if they considered this to be the case
We read in Ephesians 6:10-18 of principalities, powers, world-rulers and wicked spirits under his command, arrayed against the people of God
See Daniel 10, particularly verses 13, 20-21, where two of these princes of Satan are named-the Prince of Persia and the Prince of Greece
The early church fathers believed demons to be the wicked dead and that belief is shared by many Christians of modern times
, 'Scripture teaches us that a certain class of the dead do come back, enter in and possess the bodies of the living
The members of the class should be carefully instructed as to the way in which persons may unwittingly give ground to demons
Entertaining fanatical religious views always opens the door to evil spirits, as truly as does any wrong practice
The following words have been used by many and the results of their use prove their value: 'I refuse everything that is of the defeated one
God knows what praise will do for His children; therefore not once, but many, many times, He bids them utter the words of praise
On the wings of praise there will come into our hearts and lives every desirable emotion, overflowing outpourings of God
With the powers of spirit we know God and our relation to Him and our relation morally to every object of creation
Many Christians refuse to yield their minds to God, yet think that they are able to understand the deep things of God
All that they say in regard to God and His Eternal Purpose is distinctly opposed to the Truth as stated in God's Written Word
The Christian who has said 'the irrevocable, inclusive yes' to God, soon realizes and manifests a renewed condition of the mental powers
Without this transforming work of the Holy Spirit, they would to some extent become conformed to this world, i
For illustration: The metal worker pours hot metal into a mold and as it cools, it assumes the shape of the mold
The housekeeper pours fruit juice into a jelly mold and when it hardens, the jelly is in the shape of the mold
Christians are not to be conformed to this mold of Satan but to be conformed to God's mold, the likeness of His Son , i
Notice that the word transform indicates a change in the elemental substance, while 'conform' denotes a change in form only
A mirror can reflect only what it beholds; even so the Christian will reflect in his daily life only so much of Christ as he sees
If there is a veil upon his face, he will see imperfectly; therefore, he must so yield to God that the veil shall be taken away
Step after step, out of the shame of self-complaint, into the glory of the Lamb-life, from glory to glory, even into the same Image
Every circumstance brings us out of the wicked image of the First Adam, out of our wicked character into the full Image of the Son of God
Let us henceforth consider the Cross of Christ as a knife in the hands of the Holy Spirit to slay our sin-stained self life
They will henceforth be able to perceive the full gospel message, to believe it, and earnestly desire to live it out and to tell it out
Every detail of God's Plan of Redemption will be found pictured within these books and set forth in logical order
Redemption, in type, however, should not be presented to a class until the doctrinal truths as stated in God's Word are plainly perceived
, notice what the Apostle Paul states in reference to the gospel which he preached in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; Hebrews 10:12-17; 9:28
Historical events that are narrated in the New Testament were predicted by writers of the Old Testament centuries before their fulfillment
, there are characteristic elemental qualities pertaining to animal life that are not found upon the plane of vegetable life
Even as 'one star differeth from another star in glory,' so will the redeemed saints differ one from another in their glorified life
The same blood that is in the head of the human bodythe physical mortal body flows through each member of the body even to the extremities
There are seven dispensations: 'The Paradisaic, Antediluvian, Patriarchal, Mosaic, Messianic, Christian and Millennial'
Here again, we must note the unity in diversity, or dispensational teaching will tend to confuse rather than to enlighten
In each dispensation, human beings could truthfully say, 'God hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in His Son
Eventually only two classes of human beings will be found in the universe-those who share the Eternal Life of God and those who do not
The Eternal Son needed a human, physical body for His great Sacrificial work and declares, 'A body hast Thou prepared Me'
The saints of the Old Testament, as well as the saints of the New, put faith in the Lamb of Calvary and received Eternal Life thereby
Were each one to be questioned as to his relation to God he would reply I am a sinner saved by grace through faith therefore a child of God
Abel's name appears first upon this Faith Roll, but was he the first human being to put faith in God's Slain Lamb?
From 'to breathe,' as the sign of existence, was derived 'to be'; and from 'to breathe or pant after' came 'to long for,' 'to desire'
The words, 'His wife hath made herself ready,' seem to imply that the marriage ceremony depends upon her preparedness
Some of those constituting this Composite Bride will make ready only when the Tribulation period destroys their earthly perspective
We have already seen that one becomes a member of the Body of Christ the instant he accepts the Life of Christ
Before the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, each human being who is organically one with Him will have become one with Him in love and devotion
The 'Supper' indicates the rejoicing over the realization of this long looked for, ardently desired consummation
Words fail to describe the beauty of this Bride of the Lamb as she stands by His side radiant with the 'glory of God'
The attention of the Bible student should now be directed to the next event in connection with the manifestation of Christ's Redemptive work
The whole groaning creation is now 'delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God'
Now all is changed; for the Last Adam and His 'seed,' the host of the redeemed, now exercise dominion throughout the earth
Beasts no longer prey upon one another but return to their Edenic condition as described in Isaiah 11:6-9; 65:25
Glorious as is the Millennial Age, it will not prove to be the final manifestation of the results of Christ's Redemptive Work
No reader thinks for a moment that it is literally described here in the dimensions of equal length and breadth and height
As the holy temple described in Ephesians 21922 was built of living stones so this glorious city is built of redeemed glorified human beings
No longer is it guarded by Cherubim and the revolving sword-flame, for Calvary's Sacrifice has opened the way forever
It is a blessed life, because we realize our need and utter dependence; consequently we are kept from self-energy and self-esteem
