The new covenant is nothing other than a written document that lists the inheritance purchased by the Lord's blood. This document is signed by God Himself, and it acknowledges that all the inheritance purchased by the Lord Jesus is ours. We have gained the new covenant with the price of the blood. This document is bought with the price of blood. One gets as much as he pays for. The new covenant includes all that the blood has purchased.</P><P>What has the Lord's blood purchased? The Lord's blood has redeemed us. But whatever has been recorded in the new covenant has also been purchased by the Lord's blood. Among the many things, three are very precious. Later, we will consider them in detail. Man does not know how to speak to God according to the record of the covenant because he does not know the rights that the blood has granted him. He does not realize that he can speak to God according to the letter of the covenant. Based on the fact that God has made the covenant with him, all the spiritual blessings are his.</P><P>Do you know about the first covenant God made with man? Let me tell you about the first covenant God made with man. According to my study of the Bible, the first record of God's making a covenant with man was at the time of Noah. Before Noah, God had never made a covenant with man. The earliest record of covenant-making was God's making a covenant with Noah. In the story of God's covenant with Noah, the most difficult thing for God to do was to make man understand His will. God has tried His best to speak to us in different ages and in many ways through the prophets concerning His will for us. He truly wants us to know His will. But when we do not have a covenant, we are not clear about God's will, we do not have much assurance, and we do not know how to pray.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, do you realize that man is prone to doubt God's promises? During the meeting here, you surely think that you have faith. But when you are alone and destitute, when you are by yourself with no one helping or comforting you, what about your faith? When you are in extreme poverty and helplessness, when you are depleted of any financial means, you will see how hard it is to believe that God will supply your need. When you are seriously ill, and the doctor says that you are about to die, your heart may say, "How do I know if my prayer will help me?" You may think that you have to earnestly pray many times before God might heal you. After you pray this way, you may not know how to believe, and you may even feel that you can no longer believe in God. This is why many people do not pray at ordinary times. They think that it does not make any difference whether or not they pray, and that either way they will live. They will live if they pray, and they will live if they do not pray. They have no desire to know God's will. They realize how precious it is to understand God's will concerning a matter only when the bridge is broken and the way has disappeared before them. When they find that no one can tell them anything, they begin to pray to God and to try to understand God's will concerning a certain matter. When they encounter difficulties, the devil will put all kinds of doubts in their heart and say to them, "You have been so defiled and committed so many sins. You have been so terrible. Will God hear your prayers now? Are you not ashamed? Do you still have the boldness to ask God for help?" Not only will the devil tempt you, but your flesh will be weakened, and you will begin to doubt God in many ways. "How can God answer the prayer of men like me? How can He answer my prayers?" God already knows the smallness of your faith. That is why He only asks that you have faith like a mustard seed. He does not ask for greater faith, for He knows that you will never have greater faith. The mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds. As long as your faith is as great as the smallest seed, you will be all right. God knows that your heart is small. This is why He gives all kinds of promises to you, so that you will believe in Him. No one ever has great faith. God cannot make you believe. For this reason He has covenants with man. If you understand a covenant, you will realize that God does not require you to be perfect and has not rebuked you; He knows that you are short, and He sympathizes with your weaknesses. He sympathizes with the fact that your faith cannot match His position. He knows that your faith is too small and cannot climb over the high wall to reach Him. So He lowered Himself to covenant with man. The covenant is initiated by God and ordained by God. God gives it to us because He sympathizes with our weakness. God gives us a covenant so that we can have a means by which we can believe in Him.</P><P>At the time of Noah, man had greatly sinned and was filled with iniquities. God sent the flood to destroy them because of the great sins and iniquities. All of the living creatures, including man and animals, were destroyed by the flood. Only Noah's household of eight, together with the animals that they brought into the ark, were preserved. The people who were not destroyed by the flood could have been extremely apprehensive that a flood would once more come and destroy the world if they committed some sins again, and that there might not be another ark, and that no one could preserve the eight of them. They were kept in the ark for a year. During this time they did not see any land or people. Day and night, all they saw was a great span of water, and all they heard was the sound of water. Later when the water subsided, they began to dwell in an uninhabited lonely wilderness. They did not know if they would have to face another devastating deluge again. They did not know God's will concerning this matter. They did not know that God would not destroy the world with a flood again, keep them from hunger and thirst, cause the earth to produce food, and ensure that they lived without peril and in peace. God knew that it was difficult for man to understand His good intention; therefore, He gave man something to hold onto. He made a covenant with Noah: "And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth" (Gen. 9:8-17). God made a covenant with Noah because when Noah's household came out of the ark, their past experience would inevitably cause them to worry about their future. God was concerned that they would not believe that God would protect them from another destroying flood. As a result, He made a covenant with them so that they could believe. When Noah took hold of the words of this covenant, he was at peace and did not have to be afraid. Once he had the covenant, he could believe in God and rest in the covenant. This is the use of a covenant. Man does not know or understand God's will. God has to give man a covenant so that man will have something to hold onto. We know God's will through the covenant.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
