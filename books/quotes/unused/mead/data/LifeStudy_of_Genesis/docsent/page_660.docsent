   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suppose you were Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Could you have waited such a long time?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the ruler, Joseph could have done what was necessary to have his father brought to him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But he disciplined his brothers for their good at the sacrifice of his own enjoyment of seeing his father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I repeat, Joseph was a sober, disciplined person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His personal temperament and sentiment were absolutely controlled by life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not go along with his own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, his sentiments were under the control of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All those who take the lead in the church need such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without this kind of life we do not know how to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not have such a life, we shall contact people according to our feelings, according to whether we are happy or sad.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Joseph did not deal with his brothers according to his sentiments, but according to their need.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he had acted according to his desire to see his father, he would have had his father brought to him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in order to discipline his brothers, he delayed his enjoyment of seeing his father for at least six months.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He sacrificed his enjoyment of the immediate presence of his father for his brothers' good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apparently Joseph was treating his brothers in a rough way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the nine brothers were returning home, they might have said, "My, that man really was rough with us!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How he mistreated us!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were not only misunderstood by him, but also mistreated."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they returned to their father, they did not return joyfully, although they had the food they required.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then they told their father the sad story of what had happened to them in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They did not realize that Joseph loved them in a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have seen, he loved them in a secret way by restoring their money and by affording them sufficient provision for their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Joseph had no thought of revenge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He considered only what would be good for his undisciplined brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even in the enjoyment of the fulfillment of his dreams, he was not selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not care for himself, but for his brothers, and he paid a great price to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who take the lead among the children of God need to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not contact the saints in the church life according to our sentiments, but according to their need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Like Joseph in his dealing with his brothers, we should be neither strict nor loose in contacting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not think that Joseph was strict with his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was sober in dealing with them in order to perfect them, but he was not strict with them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Neither was he loose, saying, "I forgive you all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I don't care about what you did, for I know that God sent me here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us just praise the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If Joseph had treated them like this, there would have been no perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to his natural being, it was difficult for Joseph to put his brothers into prison for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He simply was not that kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For him to do this was to go against his good nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, in order to meet his brothers' need for discipline, he did this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the church life we should not always be so kind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At certain times the leading ones need to be rough and tough.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, if you are rough with someone, you need to be rough in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, your toughness will kill him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The point here is that we should not deal with others according to our temperament, sentiment, or natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Neither should we deal with them according to our own enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, we must contact others according to their need.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps Joseph said to himself, "For the sake of my brothers, I must be tough and talk to them in a rough manner.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I must put them into prison for three days."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Like Joseph, we all must learn to deal with others according to their need and not according to our feelings.</S>
