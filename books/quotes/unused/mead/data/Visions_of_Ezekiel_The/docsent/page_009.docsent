   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1:5-6, 26; Rev 5:9b; John 5:25; Col 2:12-13; Phil 2:7-8; Mark 10:45; Rev 5:5; Exo 19:4; Isa 40:31; Phil 4:11-13</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ezekiel is a book of pictures portraying the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the last chapter we saw four things: the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These four items are pictures portraying what God is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our experience, God is like a blowing wind and like a cloud brooding, hovering, and overshadowing us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is also like fire, shining upon us and enlightening us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By burning us, He sanctifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of burning is the real sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not need to "take time to be holy"; we need to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we mean business with the Lord in desiring to be sanctified, we must be willing to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Our God is a consuming fire" Heb 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is a jealous, sanctifying God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, God is to us like glowing, shining electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Electrum signifies the compounded God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the God Who is in us has more than simply the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gold of the divine nature has been compounded with the silver of the redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the Jews, God is typified merely by gold, but for us Christians, God is gold mixed with silver.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES Not Dead, But Living</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now we come to Ezekiel 1:5: "Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Pay particular attention to the first word in this verse, "also."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only does electrum come out of the fire, something more also comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The wind brings in the cloud; the cloud enfolds the fire; and the fire produces the electrum plus something more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Also" refers to the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we experience God as the blowing wind, the overshadowing cloud, the burning fire, and the glowing electrum, we become the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We were dead, but we have become living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We not only have God as the electrum, but we ourselves also become living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus said that the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and shall live John 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul said that we were dead, but that God has made us alive Eph 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The more we have the cycle of the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, the more we will become living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time we are blown by God and overshadowed by God, burned and consumed by God, we are enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are not so alive in the meetings, it proves that you are short of the experience of this cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The more we have the experience of this cycle, the more we will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today's Christianity always likes to have a quiet service.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you would like to have a quiet service, you had better go to a cemetery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That is the quietest place because everybody is dead and buried.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we must be noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only those who are living can make noise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if you offered a million dollars to the dead ones and asked them to be noisy, they could not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must be noisy because we have experienced God as the wind and the fire with the blowing and the consuming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How can we be quiet?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We cannot be quiet because we are the real living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word "living" in Hebrew has the same root as the word "life" in Genesis 2, where it refers to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How can we, the creatures, become living creatures?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By experiencing God as the tree of life, we will have something living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A living element, a living factor, will be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This living thing within us will continually make us living.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Four in Number</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The picture in this verse portrays us not only as being living creatures, but also as being four in number.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why does it not say five or six or ten living creatures?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many verses in the Bible show us that the number four signifies man as the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Revelation 5:9 is particularly clear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It says that the Lord has redeemed us from four sources: from every kindred, every tongue, every people, and every nation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, Revelation 21 shows us that the New Jerusalem has four sides the north, the east, the west, and the south and that each of the four sides has three gates.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This means that from every direction on the earth we can enter this city.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The number four symbolizes that we are the people redeemed from many kindreds, tongues, peoples, and nations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the eyes of God, we are the four living creatures.</S>
