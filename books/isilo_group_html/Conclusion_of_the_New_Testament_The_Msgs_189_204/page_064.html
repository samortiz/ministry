All the Four Special Gifts Not Building the Body of Christ Directly but Perfecting the Saints That They May Build the Body of Christ Directly</h2><p>All the four special gifts-the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers-do not build the Body of Christ directly. Instead, these special gifts perfect the saints that they may build the Body of Christ directly (Eph. 4:12-16).<p>In Ephesians 4:12 we see the reason for Christ&#8217;s giving the four special gifts: &#8220;For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;for&#8221; in this verse is weighty and significant. It indicates that Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers for the purpose of perfecting the saints. The saints are perfected &#8220;unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;unto&#8221; here means &#8220;resulting in.&#8221; Therefore, the perfecting of the saints results in the work of ministry, the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>According to grammar, the phrase &#8220;unto the building up of the Body of Christ&#8221; is in apposition to the phrase &#8220;unto the work of ministry.&#8221; This indicates that both phrases refer to the same thing. Therefore, the work of ministry is the building up of the Body. In verse 12 the work of ministry refers in particular to the work of the saints in building up the Body of Christ directly.<p>Ephesians 4:16, referring to the Head, Christ, says, &#8220;Out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love,&#8221; In this verse &#8220;every joint of the supply&#8221; refers to the four special gifts mentioned in verse 11. The article before the Greek word rendered &#8220;supply&#8221; is emphatic. It indicates that the supply should be a particular supply, the supply of Christ. The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers have the supply, the particular supply. Nevertheless, the Body is built up &#8220;according to the operation in measure of each one part.&#8221; &#8220;Each one part&#8221; refers to every member of the Body. Every member of the Body of Christ has its own measure, and this measure works for the growth of the Body. The Body causes the growth of itself through the supplying joints and working parts. Both the joints of the supply and every single part with its measure are needed for the church to build itself up. The growth of the Body is the increase of Christ in the church. This results in the Body building itself up.<p>The saints need to be perfected, equipped, furnished, unto the work of ministry. This work of ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ. Because so many saints are not yet doing the work of ministry, they need the special gifts to perfect them, to equip them, that they may be qualified to carry out the work of ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ. First, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers perfect the saints. This means that they build up the saints. The perfected saints then become the building members to build the Body of Christ directly. Therefore, the Body is not built directly by the four special gifts-it is built directly by all the members of the Body.<p>If we realize that the four special gifts are for the perfecting of the saints that they may build the Body of Christ directly, we shall avoid the great heresy of the clergy-laity system. In this system the leading ones are the clergy and the followers are the laity. In the church, the Body of Christ, there is no such thing as either clergy or laity, and there is no hierarchy, which annuls and kills the function of all the members. In the church we all are priests to God and members of Christ. This means that in the church every member of the Body functions to build up the Body of Christ directly.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 189-204) &nbsp; pg 64</div><br></body></html>
