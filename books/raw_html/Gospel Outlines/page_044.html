<h1 class="title">THE WONDERFUL SAVIOR</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Isa. 9:6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The prophecies concerning the Savior<br />
<span class="normal">Before the Savior came into this world, there were many prophecies concerning Him written in the Scriptures. The most numerous and clear prophecies concerning the Savior are found in the book of Isaiah. The most clear verse is Isaiah 9:6.</span></li>
<li>The position of the Savior
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Whatever job a person has, there must be a position for that job.</li>
	<li>The Scriptures speak of the person or the position of the Savior.</li>
	<li>The person of the Savior has two aspects. On one hand, He is a child born, who was given to us. On the other hand, He is the Almighty God. When He was on the earth, He was like the Almighty God. He brought things which had no being into being, and he caused the stormy sea to be still. On one hand, He was the Son; on the other hand, He was the eternal Father. In coming to this world in time, He is the Son. Before He came into the world, He was the eternal Father. The Father is the source, and the Son is the revelation of the Father. God the Father came into time to be the Son. This is the wonderful Savior.</li>
	<li>Because He is not only the child but also the Almighty God, He is wonderful! He is the Son, and He is also the Father. He is in time, but He is also in eternity.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What the Savior is to us
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He is the Counselor. The Almighty God is our Counselor.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This Counselor councils you in how to do things and provides solutions to your problems.</li>
		<li>He is a wonderful Savior. No matter what difficulty you have, He always has a way to solve your problem for you. When you have sinned, He has shed His blood for you to redeem you from sin. If you are sick, He is able to heal you. When you are laboring, He will bear the burden for you. You have no way to heaven, but He is the way. If you have lost your money, or if you have lost your son, He is able to find them and bring them back to you. Whatever problems you may have, He will solve them for you. You should give a lot of examples.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>He is the Prince of Peace; the eternal Father becomes the Prince of Peace. After men have sinned, they have no peace with God and no peace with men. Whether it is a case of husbands and wives, schoolmates, doctors and nurses, or teachers and students, they all have no peace among them. But this wonderful Savior is the Prince of Peace. Once you have received Him, everything is in peace. We have to find many examples to prove this point. This is the good news of the gospel. The gospel is not just a high and deep doctrine, but it is the Lord&rsquo;s way to solve the practical needs of man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to receive the Savior
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>You must confess you are a sinner.</li>
	<li>You have to believe that the Savior is both God and Man.</li>
	<li>You have to believe that the Savior died for you.</li>
	<li>You have to believe and receive Him as your Savior.</li>
	</ol></li>
