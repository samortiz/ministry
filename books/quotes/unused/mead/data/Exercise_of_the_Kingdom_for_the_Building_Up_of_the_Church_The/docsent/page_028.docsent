   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>STIRRED UP TO SEEK CHRIST IN A DESPERATE WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we have been compelled and encouraged to seek Christ, we shall not be idle regarding Christ, and we shall no longer be indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I must confess that I have a burden about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am concerned that not even many of us have been stirred up to seek Christ in such a desperate way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see how crucial the situation is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We shall either be punished or rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we need to say, Lord, I am desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because I will be either punished or rewarded, I must seek after You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not simply a matter of knowing the truth of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a matter of being desperate to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Are you seeking Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Are you gaining Him more and more?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If not, do not make excuses for yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not say, Lord, I can t make it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I can t come up to the standard of Your constitution in Matthew 5, 6, and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, You know that no one can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How can I make it?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, please excuse me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may excuse yourself today, but you will not be able to do so when you meet the Lord at His judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time there will be no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you try to excuse yourself then, the Lord will say, Did I not present Myself to you?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am the all-sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But were you hungry enough to seek Me?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What will you say?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You will be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because so few Christians are hungry for the subjective Christ, it is impossible for the church to be built up with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where can you find Christians who are denying the self and losing the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is difficult to find any.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most Christians stay with a particular group as long as they are happy there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when they are no longer happy, they leave and go somewhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that there is no denying of the self and no losing of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, there is one excuse after another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But what about us?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Are we making excuses, or are we being forced to seek Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to tell the Lord that we are short of Him and that we are desperate to gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>PAUL, THE PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I thank the Lord for setting up a pattern in the New Testament with the Apostle Paul 1 Tim 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul was so hungry for Christ that eventually he became fully saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, in Philippians Paul seemed to be saying, As long as I can manifest Christ, I don t care about the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For to me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am satisfied to be able to manifest Christ in any environment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul was one who sought Christ in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was utterly hungry for Christ, and he did everything possible to gain Christ, to experience Christ, and to be saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, from his experience he could say that it was God who worked within him both the willing and the working of His good pleasure Phil 2:13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>. He could also say, I can do all things in him who empowers me Phil 4:13, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>. At the end of his life, Paul had the assurance to say these words: And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom 2 Tim 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No doubt, Paul was saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He surely was one fully built into the Body of Christ and completely under the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A DESCRIPTION OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Recently a brother testified in a meeting that the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 5, 6, and 7 is a description of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I appreciate this word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the exercises and requirements of the kingdom are a description of Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They all speak of how much Christ s life can do in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The requirements of the kingdom s constitution and the exercise of the kingdom reveal what great things Christ s life can accomplish in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, there is no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His grace is all-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If Christ had not been incarnated, crucified, and resurrected, we might have an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But now, after having been incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended, Christ is the very all-inclusive life-giving Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The only question is whether or not we are hungry for Him and seek after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not make excuses for not denying the self, taking up the cross, or losing the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>None of us should offer excuses for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, we should say, Lord, there is no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am compelled to seek You, and I am encouraged to gain You.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lord, I want to be filled with You, saturated with You, and permeated with You so that I may be a part of You.</S>
