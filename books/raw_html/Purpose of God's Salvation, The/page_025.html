        <h2 class="head1">THE BREAKING OF THE NATURAL CONSTITUTION<br />
BY THE CROSS<br />
FOR THE GENUINE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>For us to be built up together in the church, we must have a pure love for the Lord and accept the purging of the cross so that the Lord can deal with our natural taste. Mary did not know much, but her love for the Lord was pure, without the mixture of her personal taste. The more a person loves the Lord and fellowships with Him, the more the Lord will appear to him and deal with him. This is the experience portrayed in Song of Songs. In chapter 1 the seeker is likened to a mare among Pharaoh&rsquo;s chariots (v. 9). This indicates that her natural strength is very strong. Hence, she needs to be stripped and dealt with by the Lord in order to be delivered from her own taste.</p>
<p>In chapter 2 she continues to seek and love the Lord, and she gains satisfaction and a degree of rest from His presence (v. 3). However, she begins to love the strong feeling of His presence. Hence, she is tried and dealt with by losing the sensation of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The seeker is in the house, but the Lord is outside leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills (v. 8). The seeker cannot stay within her house if she wants to respond to the Lord. The Lord wants us to come out of our own condition. This is a kind of spiritual stripping and dealing.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 the Lord requires His seeker to be delivered from the self and from focusing on the feeling of His presence. Therefore, He turns away from the seeker, and she seeks Him whom her soul loves but finds Him not (v. 1). This trial forces her to rise up and seek the Lord everywhere (v. 2). Often those who love the Lord have their own spiritual taste, but the Lord requires them to be delivered from their self and their natural constitution when He appears to them. If we remain in our self, we will face problems on the path of loving and pursuing the Lord. We cannot love the Lord according to our own taste.</p>
<p>When the Lord first came out to minister, no one loved Him. Then the disciples developed a loving response to Him. They were lovers of the Lord. However, they needed to be stripped and dealt with because they each had their own taste and element. Peter loved the Lord, but when he heard that the Lord would be killed and would be raised on the third day, he immediately rebuked the Lord, saying, &ldquo;God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!&rdquo; (Matt. 16:22). This was Peter&rsquo;s naturalness. Hence, the Lord dealt with Peter in a strong way, saying, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men...If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). Peter had his own taste, and James, John, Martha, and Mary also had their own tastes. Our love for the Lord must be dealt with by the Lord; otherwise, we will not be freed from our strong, natural taste at the end of our journey of following the Lord, even though we have paid the price and spent our energy. It is even possible that one day we will lose our love and be unable to go on if we can love the Lord only according to our taste.</p>
<p>In the Gospels every follower of the Lord had a different natural flavor. At the beginning of Acts the one hundred and twenty were willing to pay the price and drop their personal tastes. I do not believe that these one hundred and twenty were the only ones who believed in the Lord at that time. However, these one hundred and twenty had learned the lesson and had been dealt with. Mary the Magdalene, Martha, and Mary the mother of Jesus were among these people who had been led by the Lord, had been dealt with by Him, had learned the lesson, and did not have many opinions. Hence, so many could come together to pray in one accord for ten days (Acts 1:12-15). This was the issue of being stripped of their natural constitution and having their taste dealt with. As a result, Peter was a different person when he stood up to speak, and he expounded the Bible with clarity and understanding. The disciples were like one man; no one voiced his own opinion (vv. 15-26). It was not that Peter became the pope and practiced dictatorship; rather, everyone was freed from their natural tastes because they had learned the lesson, and their natural constitution had been dealt with by the Lord. This experience of the one hundred and twenty was the genuine church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING GENUINE IN OUR MORNING TIME<br />
WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>As those who desire to have a genuine and pure love for the Lord and to be without opinions and natural tastes, we should rise up early, come to the Lord in purity, and spend time with Him. We should meet Him in a genuine way to be touched by Him and to allow Him to work in us. A brother may have consecrated himself in the past and yet feel the need to consecrate himself again while spending time with the Lord in the morning. A sister may be high-minded, but while she is spending time with the Lord in the morning, she may see that she is at fault and is more sinful than others. A brother who serves the Lord zealously may have always followed his own will and never answered the Lord&rsquo;s call. It is not until he is touched by the Lord, who makes some demands of him, that he will understand the Lord&rsquo;s intention and will answer the Lord&rsquo;s call. If we rise up early to touch the Lord and enjoy Him, our spiritual experience will become deeper and more genuine, and the experience of our salvation will be deeper and more solid. We will sense that every consecration is deeper and more genuine. Therefore, our time of meeting with the Lord in the morning is a time for us to be saved again.</p>
<p>Some of the young saints heard the gospel in their childhood because their parents zealously love the Lord. These saints believed in the Lord and began to love Him from their childhood. However, they cannot specify at what point in time they were saved. They believe in the Lord, but they may not have touched the Lord experientially. This may be the case with their experience of believing in the Lord for salvation as well as their experience of consecration. Many saints were led by their parents to consecrate themselves to the Lord while they were still young and were also taught to pray at home. Their parents offered them to the Lord, and they said Amen. They were also taught to consecrate themselves in the children&rsquo;s meetings and were baptized. Then every summer they were helped to consecrate themselves again and again during the young people&rsquo;s edification conferences. These experiences are not wrong, but some of these consecrations were the result of being taught; they might not be the issue of meeting the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must rise up early to seek the Lord and touch Him. When we touch the Lord, the opaque and unclear experiences from our childhood will become transparent and clear. A consecration that formerly was the result of outward teaching will become an inner requirement after we touch the Lord. Only when we contact the Lord and spend time with Him can we have a genuine beginning in our spiritual experiences. The teachings that we received in our childhood were helpful, but genuine experiences can be gained only when we meet the Lord in a personal way.</p>
<p>When a person meets the Lord, he will sense something fresh. When a person meets the Lord, he will sense that his faith was not solid and that his former consecration was not deep enough. He knew that he was a sinner, but when he meets the Lord, he will sense that he is the foremost of sinners. He knew that he should preach the gospel before, but when he meets the Lord, preaching the gospel will become a genuine burden. When the Lord touches our inner being, we receive a burden. Such experiences are gained by meeting the Lord.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
