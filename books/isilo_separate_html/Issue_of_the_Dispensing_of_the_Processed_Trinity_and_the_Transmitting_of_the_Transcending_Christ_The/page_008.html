Especially for God's sonship, there is the need for God to dispense His life and nature into our being.</P><P>2.The Father's dispensing in His choosing and predestinating of the believers issues in His sonship through His sanctifying of His chosen people, making them holy as He is in His life and in His nature, to make them like God in the divine life and nature, but without His unique Godhead. This is the divine sanctification unto (for) the divine sonship. This is the center of the divine economy and the central thought of the revelation in the New Testament. Such a divine sanctification is carried out by the sanctifying Spirit (Rom. 15:16). The divine sonship is accomplished by the regenerating Spirit, who is the Spirit of the Son of God (Gal. 4:6).</P><P>I hope that these concluding notes will be a reminder to us that sanctification is still going on for our development in the sonship of God that we may grow. We will have a stronger and richer church life as we continue to take care of the divine sanctification for the sonship by the Spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
