   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ as the Trespass Offering</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John is a wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, it gives us an old gentleman, and following this a very immoral woman.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nicodemus had come to the Lord Jesus, but this immoral woman didn t come to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather the Lord went to her.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to realize this is the portable, traveling tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You shouldn t laugh at this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Don t forget that Paul spoke of the Rock that followed them 1 Cor 10:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you can say that the Rock followed them, surely you can say that the tabernacle followed them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In fact in the wilderness the tabernacle did follow them for at least thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So in the Gospel of John the tabernacle traveled from that old man in Judea to a thirsty, immoral woman in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord s intention, the tabernacle s intention, was to attract her to enter into the tabernacle, to enter into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But she didn t know this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She pretended to be so religious.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She talked about worshipping God and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She was not only immoral but religious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She had come to draw water, and the Lord spoke to her concerning the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When she asked that the Lord would give her the living water, He said to her, Go, call your husband and come here John 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the husband?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is one of the trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord touched her main trespass.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That one trespass implied others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then she lied to the Lord by telling part of the truth, making even another trespass.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She said that she didn t have a husband, so the Lord helped her to confess: You have well said, I don t have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>17, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What was this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus helped this immoral woman who was full of trespasses to realize her sins.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When such a gentleman as Nicodemus came the Lord didn t ask him to call his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nicodemus was a gentleman and very ethical.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am pretty sure he did not have more than one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So the Lord didn t need to touch him by his trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Outwardly, perhaps he had few trespasses, but what about his nature?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His nature had been bitten by the old serpent four thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Adam was bitten there in the garden, Nicodemus was also bitten, and that poisonous nature was in Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s word was marvelous, indicating that although Nicodemus was moral and ethical and gentle and good outwardly, inwardly his nature was that of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the very next chapter, in dealing with the immoral woman the Lord didn t try to touch her sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord touched her trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord knew that she was altogether immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She had had five husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not one of her husbands had satisfied her, so she was still thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His talk with her was to help her realize that she had a lot of trespasses, so she needed the One who was perfect to be her trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 8 there is another case.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Pharisees, the self-righteous ones, brought another immoral woman to the Lord Jesus saying, Teacher, this woman has been caught committing adultery, in the very act.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What then do you say?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John 8:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their intention was just to destroy the Lord s position and name.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So the Lord gave them a little instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that the Lord even touched them not only by their outward trespasses, but also by their inward sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When all those self-righteous ones heard this word, it touched their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They all went away from Him, but this one woman eventually laid her hands upon the real trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Items of the Rich Grace</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All these cases show us that in John there is not only the tabernacle, but also the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And these are items of the rich grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the tabernacle came, it came full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all have received of the fullness of this grace and even grace upon grace 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After all these cases, there is another case, that of death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In chapter eleven Lazarus got sick and died.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But his death wound was healed.</S>
