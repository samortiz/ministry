   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now we need to see on what basis reward is given.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's Word says that the reward is given because of work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Just as the Bible says clearly that salvation is by faith, in the same way the Bible says clearly that reward is by work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible reveals to us that salvation is by the faith of the sinners, and the reward is by the work of the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Faith is related to salvation; this is more than clear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Work is related to reward; this is also more than clear.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One should not mix up these two.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 4:4 says, "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To give a reward to one who works is not grace, but a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, how can one obtain a reward?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Reward comes by works and not by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Revelation 2:23 says, "And her children I will kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who searches the inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This verse says that the Lord will make all the churches know that He is the One who searches the inward parts and the hearts, and will give to each one according to his works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, He will reward each one according to his works.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How does He reward or recompense?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is according to our work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, this work is not our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We only wash our clothes to be white in the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Holy Spirit lives out Christ in us, we have the works of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some will live out Christ, and some will not live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the capital comes from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the power also originates from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But some let the Lord work within them and some do not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, this verse clearly shows us the matter of recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The matter of reward depends on whether or not a Christian is worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today God will not save a person who is worthy, and in the future God will not reward a Christian who is not worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 3:14 says, "If anyone's work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Here it says that if his work remains, he will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It does not say that if his faith remains he will be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The matter of reward depends on one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible distinguishes clearly between salvation and reward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It never mixes up salvation and reward, and it never mixes up faith and work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without faith, man cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without good works, man cannot be rewarded.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One's works must withstand before the judgment seat and survive under the scrutiny of the burning eyes before there is the possibility of receiving a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Luke 6:35 says, "But love your enemies, and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Reward is entirely due to one's work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To lend money to another without hoping to be repaid is your work, and to love your enemy is your work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You have to do these to obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nowhere does the Bible mention that one has to love his enemies and do good before he can receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither is there any verse that says one has to lend to others before he can be saved, or that he has to lend to others before he can avoid perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But there is such a verse that says if you lend to others and do good to others, your reward in heaven will be great.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Reward is of work and not of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Faith can save you, but faith cannot help you obtain the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second Timothy 4:14 says, "Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me; the Lord will recompense him according to his works."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here an example is cited.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A Christian was trying to hurt Paul; he had sinned against Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The person mentioned here was a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was not a worldly person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the future, Christians will be rewarded before God according to their works.</S>
