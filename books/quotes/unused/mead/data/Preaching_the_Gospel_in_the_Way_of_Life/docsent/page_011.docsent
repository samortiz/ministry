   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to Romans 10:6 through 8, while we are preaching Christ, this kind of preaching becomes the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to tell people that Christ today is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is in Him, and man is in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not be afraid that they cannot understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes they can understand it better than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Recently some brothers went out to preach the gospel, telling people about the Body of Christ, God's economy, and the spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those that they spoke to were able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is our gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must have the assurance that we are ministering Christ to people, and this Christ whom we minister to others is the all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not only is He the Savior and the Redeemer, but He is also the Head, the Lord, and the One on the throne with glory and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In a living way we must tell people about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not preach the old gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we preach a living Christ, the Holy Spirit will honor our preaching, and the word that we speak will become the Spirit and life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our word will become the word in their heart and in their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we can point out to them that Christ is now in their heart and in their mouth because today Christ is in the Spirit and He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may give them the illustration of electricity and radio waves.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the word is spoken at the radio station, it becomes radio waves that bring the word to every part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this sense it becomes a living word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may tell people, "Now I am speaking in the Spirit, and the Spirit is like electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My word is in the Spirit, so it is in you, in your heart, as the living Spirit who also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What you need now is simply to believe in Him and say to Him, Lord Jesus.'</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you will open your mouth to call Jesus the Lord, that means you are saved."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we can read them 1 Corinthians 12:3, which says, "Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a person says, "O Lord Jesus!", this means that the Holy Spirit is moving within him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need to go out to teach people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We simply should go to make people genuine Christians in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We can do it very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In one minute a person can be converted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can say, "I am speaking for Christ, and I am speaking in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now Christ is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Would you say, Lord Jesus'?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the person does this, he will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This depends on the faith that we exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we go to a person and exercise our faith to such an extent, the Holy Spirit will honor it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will see a real conversion, a real change in life in this man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There will be a real moving within him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is the start of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will love the Lord, he will love the Scriptures, he will love to contact genuine Christians, and he will love to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will prove that he has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That he does not know much doctrine does not mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not give him too much doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, we should help him in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, we should try not to argue with people, saying, "Sir, do you believe there is a God?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This opens the door for the enemy to come in to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It opens the door for argument and closes the door for believing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is the fact, so there is no need to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is God; there is no doubt about this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether or not someone acknowledges that there is a God, everyone believes deep within there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we should simply speak something in a living way about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Just a few words are sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the person we speak with will pray, "O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once a person calls Jesus the Lord, he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should simply tell people to call Him the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should also help the person to realize that Christ is everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is omnipresent, because He is in the Spirit and He is the Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is like electricity and like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever we are, electricity is there and the air is there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The way to receive Him is simply by saying "Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whenever a person would open his or her mouth to say "Lord Jesus," we have to say, "Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here is a soul gained through me."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a second step, we must tell this person that we are sinful and that we have to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then he will say, "Lord Jesus, I am sinful," and we can help him to see that all his sins were put on Jesus when He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We can give him the gospel in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many times we have to give someone the gospel after they call on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This can be compared to bringing him to America and then showing him the things in America.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need not tell him the things about America while he is still outside of it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We can bring him to America and say, "Look, here is Los Angeles; you are right here."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must bring him into Christ and then tell him the things in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brothers, go and try to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These are some shortcuts for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
