These verses are too profound! They tell us that there is a divine power. In Greek it means a dynamo. God exercises upon us this very power by which He raised up the Lord Jesus from the dead and exalted Him to the top of the universe, subduing and subjecting all things under His feet, and making Him the Head over all things to the church. This church is His Body, and His Body is the fullness, the overflowing, the expression of the all-inclusive One who fills all in all. This is marvelous! This is the church. This is the kind of church the Lord is going to recover. This is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, who is in resurrection, in exaltation, in the headship. How could this be? The only way is that this One has to saturate us with His resurrection and His exaltation and His headship. When He Christifies us, by saturating us, He does it with all the attributes of the all-inclusive Christ. Christ is the motor, the dynamo in the church life. If there is no dynamo in the church life, it is dead and empty. That is not the church the Lord wants to recover. The Lord wants to recover a church with a dynamo.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FILLED UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</H2><P>In Ephesians 3:16-18 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen the believers with power through the Spirit into the inner man so that Christ the Son could make His home in the believers. This is so that they might be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God. The Father strengthens through the Spirit so that the Son could make home. This is the Triune God getting Himself fully settled in your inner being to fill your mind and emotion and will, and even to fill every corner of your conscience and heart and spirit. He wants to fill you so that every part of your entire being might be filled unto overflowing with the Triune God. This is the reality of God's expression. This is what the Lord wants to recover.</P><P>The Lord does not want to recover the trivial doctrines or practices. What He wants to recover is that the Father would strengthen us through the Spirit into our inner man, that the Son, the all-inclusive One, might make His home and get Himself fully settled into our heart, into every part of our inner being, so that our whole being will be filled unto the overflowing of the Triune God to become an expression of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Ephesians 4:4-6 tells us that there is one Body and one Spirit and one hope of our calling. There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism. There is one God and Father of all who is over all, through all, and in all. With one Body and one Spirit there is one hope. The Lord is going to recover a church filled, saturated, and mingled with the Spirit, full of hope. Such a church is one with the Lord through faith in baptism that God the Father may be above them and through them and in them all the time. This is a church which is the embodiment of the Triune God, mingled with the Spirit, one with the Lord, fully mingled with the Father who is above them, through them, and in them.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Concerning the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
