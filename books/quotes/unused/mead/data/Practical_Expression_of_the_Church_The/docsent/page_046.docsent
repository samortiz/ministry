   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT THE CAPABILITY, BUT THE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do not think that the elders in the church must be persons with certain natural qualifications and capabilities.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No, that is not what the church needs; that is what worldly organizations need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Worldly organizations need someone with a capable and clever mind and a good character.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may say that this kind of person would make a good elder.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But he is not a good elder; he can only be a good chairman in a certain society.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is a good manager, but he is not a good elder for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1944, the war in China was nearly ended.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There was a man who was highly educated and qualified in government work and whom some of the brothers were trying to bring to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was quite probable that he would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then the brothers told Brother Watchman Nee that if such a man with his qualifications were saved, surely he would be the best for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Brother Nee said, "No, he is only good for government work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is not good for the church."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What the church needs is not capable or qualified men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They can build up the tower of Babel, but they cannot build up the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What the church needs are those who have been captured, subdued, conquered, fully possessed by Christ, and then growing in Him in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not think that you can do things satisfactorily if you hold responsibility in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may do everything right, but you are not the proper person to hold responsibility, because you have never been captured by Christ nor grown into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To do things right is one thing, but to have the flow of life is another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day in 1948, the church in Shanghai had a large love feast.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was a sister serving who was exceedingly capable; she did everything right.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But you could only sense her capability; you could not sense much life in her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She was so capable in doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She would really be good for the Y.W.C.A., but she is not so good for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not the capability that matters, but the life expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church, it is not doing things rightly that is required, but the rich flowing out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is all the church needs.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church needs a group of elders who are full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of the brothers must be willing to be fully captured by Christ and to grow in Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The flow of life from these brothers is the function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why I stress again and again that we must not care for what is right and what is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must not care for the teachings or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regardless of how much you know or regulate, there still may be no life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are a building with living functions, not a brick building without life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What the church requires is the flow of life, for the function of all the members is in this flow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you come to the meeting of the church and pray something regarding the Lord, all the brothers and sisters must sense the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you go to visit a family, perhaps you will not say much, but if life flows out you will water and refresh them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the function, and this function requires the ground given to the Head and the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all must be captured, possessed and grow in life that we may function.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>NEVER REPLACE THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of how great a gift you are, you cannot replace the members.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You are just a part of the Body, you cannot replace the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you have the gift of an apostle or prophet, you should not substitute or replace all the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What you should do is to perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the prophets, apostles, evangelists, and pastors and teachers are given for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the saints must function to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Ephesians 4:12, the King James Version has three "fors": "for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But in the Greek, there is only one "for."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first "for" is right, but the following ones must be "to": "for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the body of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you have the gift of an apostle or prophet, you should not replace the saints, but do a perfecting work to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The perfecting of the saints is to the work of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let me illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose you are a gift as a prophet or apostle to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before you came, all the brothers simply did not know how to pray in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet, after you came, you are the only one who prays in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the brothers and sisters appreciate your prayers so much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must be clear that this substitution and replacement is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps before you came, many of them would not pray in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if you would perfect them properly, after a certain time everyone will be praying in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You come not to replace but to perfect them to function.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not easy to change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that today some brothers and sisters are settled already.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They think, "Let Brother Brown do this, or let Brother Smith do that, or let Brother Jones handle that."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All the gifted persons must perfect the saints to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who take the lead must be extremely careful not to do anything to replace or substitute others.</S>
