<p>God often allows an individual believer or even a church to stumble and be broken. God first adorns us, and then He breaks us. He first equips us, and then He lets us pass through the furnace. He first revives us, and then He tries us. Sometimes the breaking, burning, and trying are in the form of external persecutions and attacks, and at other times they are in the form of internal disputes and discord. We cannot say that a church or a brother in these circumstances has fallen. We must remember that although the outward condition may be bad, the intrinsic nature is being purified and built up.</p>
<p>The individual believers and the church are filled with mixture even though they are being revived. This mixture includes everything of the natural man, such as our feelings, interests, preferences, disposition, and pleasures. Even though a revival is the work of the Holy Spirit, it is mixed with the human element. Hence, God gives us grace for us to rise up, and He also breaks us in order to purify us. God knows our measure, and He knows how to break us; He is not severe. We may feel that we are about to die under God&rsquo;s breaking, but He knows how much breaking we need. The breaking will neither be too heavy nor too light. We may feel as if we are dead, but we are not, for He will enliven us again. After we are made alive, He will give us another revival, in which we will think that we are doing well. We do not realize that there is still much mixture in us and that God must break us yet again. We must understand that we are filled with mixture and, hence, require God&rsquo;s repeated breaking.</p>
<p>A brother once testified that while he was traveling, he saw a mountain range and was reminded of Christ&rsquo;s position in creation. This caused a sense of reverence to rise up in his heart. At the same time, however, a sense of pride also rose up in him, and he began to consider how commendable it was for him to be the first to receive such a revelation and vision concerning Christ in creation. This shows how easy it is for the human element to be manifested. Let us consider this example. God in His mercy visited this brother and caused him to remember and touch Christ while sightseeing. But the brother became proud and considered himself to be important. This example exposes the mixture in us.</p>
<p>We need to be tried because we are filled with mixture. We are so full of mixture that we do not know ourselves. We have no idea how much mixture there is in our motive, intention, aim, will, and inclination and in what we desire to achieve and gain. Our mixture needs trials in order to be exposed so that we may be purified. To be tried is to be purified.</p>
<p>It is not simple to be purified; we cannot be purified through one trial. After a trial we may think that our mixture has been removed, but after two years it is still present. It is even possible for something that we think has been removed to still be present after twenty years. Those who have learned some lessons know what their problems are when they pass through trials. For example, Abraham lied when he went down to Egypt (Gen. 12:9-20). Later he returned to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, and he called on the name of Jehovah (13:1-4), but the element of lying was still in him. Hence, when the circumstance arose again, he lied again (ch. 20). However, he was different; his first failure left a mark that caused him to somewhat know himself.</p>
<p>We cannot gain spiritual stature from one experience. We experience salvation once, but every other spiritual matter is not experienced only once. God first equips us, and then He tries us. He first gives us grace and then breaks us. This cycle occurs again and again. When we are in the process, we feel miserable and dejected. We fail in one matter and fall short in another. When our condition improves slightly, we fail again; when our work has a result, a storm blows away the issue of our toil. We may have labored in a local church for seven years, but suddenly trouble arises, and we suffer loss and are in anguish. We must remember that this process is necessary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THE REVELATION OF RESURRECTION<br />
IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF DEATH</h2>
<p>In the book of Philippians Paul wrote, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death&rdquo; (3:10). He did not write this in Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, or any other Epistle. When Paul wrote Romans, he was busy traveling, and when he wrote 1 and 2 Corinthians, his work was spreading. When we are busy and our work is spreading, we cannot sense the need to know the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. The apostle Paul was not an exception. It was not until he was put into prison and was in bonds, like a grain of wheat that is buried in the ground, that he sensed the deep need to know Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. He realized that he needed the revelation of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>At this time Paul could write the Epistle to the Philippians concerning his pursuing to know resurrection by being conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death. At this point he was put into an environment of death. In principle, his prison was his tomb. Paul could not endure this environment by himself. Hence, in the depths of his being he sensed his need to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and to be conformed to His death.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
