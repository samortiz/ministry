   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Gospel Hymns</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In relation to preaching the gospel, there are two categories of hymns that we should be familiar with.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first category is gospel hymns, and the second is hymns on the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have many gospel hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hymns, #1080 was written using the thought of the book of Ecclesiastes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is also #1024, which we used in the gospel marches that we had in the early days in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we sing a gospel hymn, we should not be too concerned about the music; otherwise, we will lose the flavor of the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we should express the feeling of the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many years ago in mainland China Dr. John Sung was powerful in preaching the gospel, and he was full of feeling when he sang a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once in a gospel campaign meeting, everyone was waiting for Dr. Sung to come to the stage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suddenly he came in through the main entrance at the back of the hall, singing, Down with Satan, down with Satan, / Out with sins, out with sins to the tune of a popular revolutionary chorus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, everyone was enlivened and received salvation without the preaching of a gospel message.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In that meeting Satan was defeated, sins were forgiven, and people were released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the young saints should not fear their schoolmates who are knowledgeable in science, philosophy, and other subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>People who seek knowledge are miserable inside.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should lead the people whom we contact at school or in gospel meetings to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to do this, we need to be familiar with the gospel hymns by reading the ones in our hymnal and learning to sing them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hymns on the Assurance of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we preach the gospel, we should also be familiar with hymns on the assurance of salvation, such as Hymns, #309.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not difficult for young people to sing hymns, because many of them have a good foundation in music.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is especially not difficult for the sisters to sing hymns, because God created them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Ecclesiastes 12:4 Solomon is referring to the vocal chords when he mentions the daughters of song.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When young people sing, there truly is music.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Among the hymns on the assurance of salvation, Hymns, #322, which is about the Fountain that never runs dry, is a good hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Another good hymn is #296, which was written by Charles Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not an emotional hymn; it is very elegant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first stanza says, And can it be that I should gain / An int rest in the Savior s blood?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>/ Died He for me, who caused His pain?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>/ For me, who Him to death pursued?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>/ Amazing love! how can it be / That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fourth stanza is also very good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the young saints invite their professors to a meeting, it is good to sing hymns with them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can choose a stanza that we like and lead our professors to sing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will help them to receive the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we sing a hymn, others should be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should then sing with them according to how they are touched.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hymns, #499 is also a good hymn to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are always singing these hymns, it will be difficult for our gospel friends not to be touched and to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Distributing Gospel Tracts</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Gospel tracts are another tool for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we know some gospel verses and hymns, we must pray to the Lord and say that, because we are a branch in the vine, we want to bear fruit by preaching the gospel every day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, the church in Taipei needs to print gospel tracts, and we should all build up the habit of having some gospel tracts with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we meet people, we can give them a gospel tract.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This practice is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I was young, this was my practice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the commercial statistics in the United States, if a person distributes one hundred advertisements and has a three-percent response, he will make a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we distribute one hundred gospel tracts and only one tract is effective, we are making a profit, because someone will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By distributing gospel tracts, we maintain an atmosphere of the gospel, and we can break through our shyness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sisters and even brothers feel ashamed to distribute gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if we are willing to distribute gospel tracts, we will be able to break through this bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because Satan has his power of darkness, we are not ashamed to speak about Confucius, but we feel shy to speak about the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This happens even in a Christian country like the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The feeling of shyness comes from the devil, and the way for us to break through this feeling is to distribute gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The great American evangelist D. L. Moody had the practice of preaching the gospel to at least one person every day, even if he spoke only one sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One day he was about to go to sleep when he realized that he had not spoken to anyone that day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, he quickly got dressed and went out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because it was late at night he was unable to find anyone except a policeman who was on night duty.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Moody ran to the policeman and told him that he must believe in Jesus to be delivered from perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even though the policeman was offended, Moody was not concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Eventually, this policeman was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should all have such an attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should be persistent.</S>
