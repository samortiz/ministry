We need to have an overall view of these three chapters, which cover five matters: pride, our inability to forgive others—the root of which lies in our dispositional anger, lust, riches, and ambition. All these problems are within us. We need a divine pest control to kill these “scorpions.”</p><p>Matthew 18 deals with the way we should live and act in the kingdom of the heavens: (1) we should become like little children (vv. 2-4); (2) we should not stumble others or set up any stumbling block (vv. 5-9); (3) we should not despise even a little believer (vv. 10-14); (4) we should hear the church and not be condemned by it (vv. 15-20); and (5) we should forgive a brother without limit (vv. 21-35).</p><p>All stumbling takes place because of pride. Humility will rescue us.</p><p>In both of its aspects, universal and local, the church represents the kingdom of the heavens, having authority to bind and to loose. If any believer refuses to hear the church, he will lose the fellowship of the church and will be like the Gentile (the heathen) and the tax collector (the sinner), who are outside the fellowship of the church. Such a one is cut off from the fellowship of the church in order that this loss of fellowship may encourage him to repent and to recover his fellowship with the church.</p><p>In chapter eighteen we see how to deal with someone who offends others as well as the seriousness of offending others. In verses 15 through 20 the emphasis is on the offending brother needing to repent. But in the parable (vv. 23-35) the emphasis is on the offended one needing to forgive. Both our unwillingness to repent and our unwillingness to forgive will keep us out of the kingdom not only in this age but also in the coming age. If I offend you, I need to go to you and repent. If you offend me, I need to look to the Lord for the grace to forgive you from my heart. If we do this, we will have the proper kingdom life and will share in the manifestation of the kingdom.</p><p>The religionists’ temptation (Matt. 19:3) afforded the Lord an opportunity to reveal that marriage life (vv. 3-12) and our attitude toward riches (vv. 16-30) are related to the kingdom of the heavens. Marriage life touches the matter of lust, and our attitude toward riches touches the matter of covetousness. The kingdom of the heavens rules out every trace of our lust and covetousness.</p><p>Matthew 19:16-26 reveals the way for a rich man to enter into the kingdom. To have eternal life (v. 16) in the Gospel of John is mainly for regeneration, for the new birth. But in the Gospel of Matthew, eternal life is for the kingdom. To enter into life here (v. 17) is to enter into the kingdom of the heavens (v. 23), a realm of God’s eternal life. This differs from being saved. When we are saved we receive God’s life, but to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to live and walk by God’s life. To live and walk by God’s life is to follow the Lord. To follow the Lord is to love Him above all things (10:37-38). This is the supreme requirement for entering into the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>Composition for prophecy with main point and sub-points:</p>
