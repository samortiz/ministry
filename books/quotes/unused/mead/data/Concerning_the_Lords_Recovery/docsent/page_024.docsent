   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S EXPRESSION IN GENESIS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This expression began with individuals in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The expression first began with Adam, but Adam fell.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then Abel was raised up to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To some extent Abel was successful in expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then Enosh called upon the name of the Eternal One Who was and Who is and Who is to be the great I Am, the great To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then came Enoch who walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later Noah came on to the scene, not just to walk with God, but also to work with God and to have a common interest with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob depict one complete person with Joseph as an annex to Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In these four persons as a complete being, God was very much manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But these were just individuals, and God wants a corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>GOD'S EXPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THROUGH A COLLECTIVE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Exodus God came in to save His chosen people, a collective people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He saved, not one or two persons, but several million people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He delivered a collective people out of the tyranny of Pharaoh in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were brought first to Mount Sinai to receive the revelation of the building of a tabernacle, so that the very God in the heavens could come down to dwell and to express Himself in a material dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From Exodus through Malachi is a history of this dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the surface you may say that is the history of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually that is the history of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Old Testament is so simple and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It had nine great men as landmarks of the human race and a people raised up to build a dwelling place for God on the earth for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The entire universe was created by God with man as the center to express the eternal God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet what was revealed in the Old Testament was only the model.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was not the real structure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reality came in the New Testament, but it was the same in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, an individual came who was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was God Himself becoming a man, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, He is nothing less than God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is our Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, He is a man because He took our nature, our blood and flesh, upon Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He became incarnated in the flesh to be a real man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This wonderful One lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What did He do?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You might say that He did a lot of miracles and gave a lot of teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is right but it is a kind of apprehension on the surface.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you get into the depth of the matter, you could see that He was expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His entire life and His entire living on this earth was the very expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No man has ever seen God, but this One declared God John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This One is the effulgence of the divine glory, and this One is the express image of the divine substance Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On one occasion three disciples went to the mountain with Him where they saw His glory Luke 9:28-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One of these three later wrote the Gospel of John and said, "We beheld His glory" John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether He was doing some miracle, or whether He was teaching, He was the expression of the invisible God.</S>
