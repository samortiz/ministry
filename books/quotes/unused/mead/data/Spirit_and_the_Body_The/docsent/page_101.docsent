   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SITUATION TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to apply this matter of the unique oneness to the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today, there is no unique oneness among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If Christians do not like one another, they simply feel free to start another meeting, claiming that they are worshipping God and that God is with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nothing binds them together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, everyone does what is right in his own eyes and makes his own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How many choices there are in today's Christianity!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seems that nearly everyone has the liberty to establish a church according to his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some Christians, for example, appreciate foot washing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do not agree with this practice, you will not be accepted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, the ones who advocate foot washing have a foot-washing church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The same may be true regarding head covering or regarding the type of wine or juice used at the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some insist upon grape juice, and others argue in favor of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Still others have different opinions about the bread or about the size of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, there is a multitude of so-called churches according to various tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today in Christendom there is too much freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a person does not agree with others, he takes the liberty to establish a church according to his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It seems that any kind of preaching or teaching can gain at least a small following, even if a man's following includes only the members of his family.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What a pitiful situation!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the words of Moses, this is doing what is right in our own eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the children of Israel were about to enter into the good land, Moses commanded them to do this no longer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, they had to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For the Israelites, the place of worship was uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It did not depend upon man's choice or taste; it was altogether a matter of God's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because God had made His choice, the children of Israel were one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>RETURNING TO THE PROPER GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we all know, the time came when the children of Israel were scattered, some to Syria, some to Egypt, and the majority to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The time of glorious oneness was over.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not think that while they were in Syria, Egypt, and Babylon they did not worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Certainly they worshipped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, they did not build the temple in any of those places, because they knew that the temple could be built only on the unique site, on Mount Zion in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a temple had been built in Babylon exactly the same as the temple in Jerusalem, it still would have been wrong, for it would have been built on the wrong site.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Jews did not dare to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even today, they are waiting for the recovery of the proper site, which is presently occupied by a Moslem mosque.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Israelites had been in captivity seventy years, the Lord commanded them to return to the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While they were in Babylon, they were, of course, still the children of Israel and they could worship God; however, they had no temple.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because they did not have the temple, they did not have the full enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A number took heed to God's word and returned to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose a group of Israelites who began the journey from Babylon to Jerusalem stopped halfway.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being neither in Babylon nor in Jerusalem, they would have been yet another division.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose another group left Babylon and came very close to Jerusalem, settling down just outside the city.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although they would have been very close to Jerusalem, they would still have been a division.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because they were not actually in Jerusalem, they would still have been a division, no matter how close they were to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Applying this to today's situation, I would like to ask you where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are you in Egypt or Syria or Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Have you stopped halfway back to Jerusalem or just outside Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can boldly declare that we are in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who are in Jerusalem, those in the Lord's recovery, are not in a division.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who have not come all the way back to Jerusalem are a division.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God's people need to come back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today, we are no longer in division; we are the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord's recovery is not a division.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, we have the right, the position, the boldness, and the confidence to say that we are in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regarding the church, a fight is raging today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those in the denominations say, "Why do you claim that you are the church and that you are the recovery?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We reply, "Yes, we are the church, and we are the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They would have to say that they are Presbyterians or Methodists, but not the church.</S>
