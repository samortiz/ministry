Life is a matter in the spirit, that is, in the divine Spirit mingled with our human spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Life is the Spirit and the Spirit is life. Thus, if we are going to know life, to experience life, and to taste all the riches of life, we have to know this basic matter of the Spirit. I feel that the verses in the Scripture reading can give us a full picture of the Spirit for life. We need to see something in a fresh way, in a new way, and in a deeper way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS<br>AND ATTAINMENTS</H2><P>John 4:24 says that God is Spirit. We are told by the Bible that in time God created the universe. Later, God took the step of being incarnated. Creation is to bring things into existence. Incarnation is to bring God into the things that exist (John 1:14). Although creation brought things into existence, the created things had nothing to do with God. God was only the Creator, but incarnation brought God into His creature. He was the Creator, yet He became one with His creature, man. He even became one of the creatures; He became a man. This man's name was Jesus. Jesus was God mingled with man, the God-man. Jesus was the Creator mingled with the creature. We all have to know Jesus to such an extent. Jesus was a God-man, a man having God mingled with Him as one. In this little man, you could see both man and God, both the creature and the Creator.</P><P>Then this wonderful Person with the divine nature and the human nature, with divinity and humanity, lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through all the sufferings of human life. At the end of His human life, He was put on the cross. That means He went into death and tasted death. He conquered death, broke through death, and walked through and out of death. All human beings are captured by death. Not one human being is willing to die. Only one Person, Jesus, was willing to die. He walked into death, through death, and out of death. Acts 2:24 says that death could not hold Him. Death tried its best to hold Him, but death failed. It could not hold Him, because He is the resurrection and the life. Death cannot hold life, but life can swallow up death. Death cannot hold resurrection, but resurrection gets through death. Christ walked into death's region and territory, but death could not affect Him. He had a tour, a sightseeing, of death.</P><P>When He went into death, He brought all the things of the old creation to an end. This included the termination of the old heaven, the old earth, and all the negative, sinful, and dark things. Satan, sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, and the old creation were brought to the cross (Heb. 2:14; John 1:29; Rom. 8:3; John 12:31; Rom. 6:6). The cross is the termination of the old creation. You were terminated there. Before you were born, you were terminated already on the cross by the death of Christ (Gal. 2:20). Death could not do anything with Christ, but by death He brought everything to an end. He terminated the entire old creation.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of God's Purpose by the Growth of Christ in Us &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
