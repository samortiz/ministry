   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.The work on the third day signifies the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His work on the third day God caused the waters under the heaven to be gathered together unto one place, made the dry land to appear, and caused the earth to bring forth grass, herbs, and trees.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Originally the earth was covered by the deep waters; there was no sign of life, nor any life at all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The earth was buried deep under the judging water of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Except for darkness, there was nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Other than the billowing of filthy waves, there was not a shadow of land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the earth itself had disappeared, there was no earthly life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then God began His own work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, He caused the land to emerge out of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, He caused life to appear on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The work on this day is clearly a type of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The words "the third day" are sufficient enough to prove that the work on this day is a type of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Corinthians 15:4 says, "He has been raised on the third day."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are many places in the Scripture where the third day and resurrection are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is true not only in the New Testament, but in the Old Testament as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Three days after the Passover, there is the feast for offering the firstfruits of the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This refers clearly to Christ's resurrection three days after His death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In First Corinthians 15 there is a peculiar phrase, "He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures" v. 4 . The resurrection of the Lord Jesus on the third day was prophesied in the Scriptures, that is, in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where can we find the third day?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not have to look at all the places in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Genesis 1, at the beginning of the Bible, we find the first "third day."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot help but consider this as a type of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not only is the numerical designation, "the third day," a type, but the work of the third day is also a proof to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The earth was once buried under the water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 9 says, "Let the dry land appear."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Formerly the earth was under the water; then it rose above the water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The earth rose out of the tomb of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once it was covered by water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then it rose above the water and became higher than the water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a beautiful picture of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We can see this picture clearly at the time of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a man is baptized, his whole being is immersed into the water, and then he comes out of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:12 tell us that baptism by immersion into the water is a symbol of death, burial, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the land coming out of the water is a type of resurrection out of death and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Isaiah 57:20 tells us that water represents sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"But the wicked are like the tossed sea, / For it cannot be calm, / And its waters toss up mire and mud."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The land buried under the water is like the Lord Jesus buried in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The land did not remain under water forever.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On the third day it rose from the water.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This situation is like the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 6 clearly tells us about the relationship between the Lord Jesus' resurrection and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"For the death which He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life which He lives, He lives to God" v. 10 . And, "knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death lords it over Him no more" v. 9 . As the land came out of the water, the resurrection of Christ disassociates Him from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The work on the third day had two levels.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only did the land come out of the water, but it also bore new life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This speaks of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 11 tells us that the land brought forth all kinds of grass, herbs, and fruit-bearing trees.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Formerly there was no life on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On this day, however, life began to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Formerly death reigned.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now life came.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God did not create life on the second day, or cause things to grow on the land on the fourth day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On this day, the third day, God created life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 6:4 tells us that "we have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without resurrection there would be no new life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>New life comes after resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before the land emerged out of the water, no life could grow on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There must first be the separation from the water before there can be the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There must first be resurrection before there can be life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After resurrection, life will surely follow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without new life, resurrection is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Saints who pay attention to their spiritual progress should note this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the second level of the third day's work, the most important matter is the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the natural result of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The goal of resurrection is to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Otherwise, why did the land come out of the water?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The land came out for the purpose of bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible is not silent concerning the relationship between resurrection and fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Romans 6:22 says, "But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>How can we be freed from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are freed by identifying with the Lord in His death, burial, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is what Genesis 1:11-13 tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The result of this resurrection is fruit unto sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, fruit-bearing is the sure result of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is not the only place that tells us this.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Romans 7:4 also says, "You also have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that you might be joined to another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Without death, there is no resurrection and there is no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The fruits that are for God come solely from dying and resurrecting with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The only fruit that counts before God is the fruit based on the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In God's eyes anything that has not passed through death and resurrection is of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is condemned by Him and is not qualified to bear fruit.</S>
