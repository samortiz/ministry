   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Of the City Proper</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 16 we have the measurements of the city proper.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And the city lies foursquare, and its length is the same as the breadth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And he measured the city with the reed, at twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was young, I was troubled by the fact that the height of the wall was a hundred and forty-four cubits and that the height of the city was twelve thousand stadia.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The measurements of the city imply that the city proper is like a mountain with the height of twelve thousand stadia, whereas the wall itself from the foundation to the top is a hundred forty-four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Twelve thousand stadia are more than seven million feet, or more than one thousand three hundred sixty miles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Another thing that troubled me about the city was that it has just one street.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I wondered how this one street could serve all twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to my opinion, there should have been at least twelve streets, one for each gate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day, during my stay with Brother Nee in Shanghai, he pointed out that New Jerusalem is a mountain, and that the one street spirals down the mountain from the throne and passes by all twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter which gate we enter, we find ourselves on the same street.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because the street is a spiral, it is impossible for anyone to get lost in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even if you walk blindly along this street, you will never lose your way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 16 says that the city lies foursquare.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The length is the same as its breadth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact that New Jerusalem is square signifies that it is perfect and complete in every way, absolutely straight and not in the least oblique.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The length, breadth, and height of New Jerusalem are equal; it is twelve thousand stadia in each dimension.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Twelve thousand is one thousand times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion in God s eternal administration, twelve thousand signifies a thousand times this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to its measurements, New Jerusalem is a cube.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and in the temple, are equal in length, breadth, and height Exo 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was a cube measuring ten cubits in each dimension, and the Holy of Holies in the temple was a cube twenty cubits in each dimension.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That the length, breadth, and height of New Jerusalem are equal signifies that the entire New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, New Jerusalem is the Holy of Holies enlarged to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Life-study of Hebrews we pointed out that our experience of the Holy of Holies must be constantly increasing see message fifty-two, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>238-239 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that in our experience the Holy of Holies must be continuously enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Firstly, we have the smaller Holy of Holies in Exodus; then we have the larger Holy of Holies in 1 Kings; and ultimately we have the largest Holy of Holies in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, our Holy of Holies will be more than one thousand three hundred sixty miles in length, width, and height.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we need to see what the principle of the Holy of Holies is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The principle of the Holy of Holies is that man can live and walk directly in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Old Testament, only the high priest was allowed to enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the book of Hebrews reveals that through the redeeming blood of Christ, the Holy of Holies is open to all those who believe in Him Heb 10:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the redeemed ones may enter into the presence of God, live there, and remain there, enjoying fellowship in oneness with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The coming New Jerusalem will be such a place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everyone in it will see God, touch God, worship God, serve God, and even live and dwell in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church life today must be a Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church must be a cube, and its nature must be utterly holy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. Of the Wall</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 17 says, And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, a measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A hundred and forty-four is twelve times twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Twelve times twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion of absolute perfections and eternal completions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How perfect and complete is the wall of the holy city in God s eternal administration!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse says that the wall is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is in resurrection that man will be like the angels Matt 22:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, a measure of a man, that is, of an angel signifies that the wall of the city is not natural, but in resurrection.</S>
