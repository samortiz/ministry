   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EMBODIMENT OF THE FULLNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell" 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is rich, full, and complete; all His fullness dwells bodily in Christ 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This very Christ portrayed in Colossians is our life 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This all-inclusive, excellent, wonderful One is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have a physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If that life were gone, we would not have one to live.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is for us to live.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not live American or Chinese; we should not live old folks or young people; we should all live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether you are humble or proud, pleasant or tough, does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only when you hate people but even when you love them, you may not be living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible is not a book of ethics, teaching you to love rather than hate; its message is that we should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are to be neither moral nor immoral.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are called Christians, which means "Christ-men."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus we must live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Religion's wrong concept is that God wants us to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God wanted good men, He could create billions of them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But He cannot create people who live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is omnipotent, but He cannot live Christ for you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He needs you to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The world has many good people, but where are those who live Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you were married, you were a "raw" husband, a beginner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But now your crudeness and toughness have worn off, and you seldom offend your wife.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Please be assured that God does not want your kindness and gentleness any more than He wanted your crudeness and toughness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wants you to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1933 I was a young man staying in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Two or three times a week I would go to visit Brother Nee and spend the afternoon with him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One afternoon we sat down together, he in a rocking chair and I on the sofa.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After a long, long silence he suddenly asked, "Witness, what is patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone knows what patience is; why would he ask me that?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I dared not answer, but he just kept rocking and again asked, "What is patience?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I repeated his question, and he did too.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Finally the long time of waiting forced me to say, "Patience is enduring and suffering when one is mistreated."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Chinese the character for patience is a knife pierced into a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My answer was obviously right, but Brother Nee shook his head.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Another long silence ensued.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then he said, "Patience is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was puzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"What do you mean, Brother Nee?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I asked.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He would not explain further, though I kept begging him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He just went on rocking and repeating, "Patience is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Evening came on, and I had to leave for dinner at my lodging place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So I said, "Sorry, Brother Nee, I have to leave now."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He replied, "Patience is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I said good-by, and again his answer was, "Patience is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I got back to the church guest house, I had no heart to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I went to my room, knelt down, and, nearly weeping, prayed, "Lord, what is this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Patience is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord heard my prayer and that of Brother Nee, who was also praying for me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Within a few days, the light came.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I saw that patience is Christ because Christ is my life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every human virtue is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because He is my life, He is my everything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I was so exhilarated I felt like a bird soaring in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That very day I began to delve into the book of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory" 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you live Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Don't say this is poor English!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every day we should live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is "the hope of glory" 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now He is life to us; in the future He is glory to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That glory is our hope.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our hope is in knowing that glory is coming and that that glory is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ is in me now as my life and before me as my glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the genuine Christ, our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do not take Christianity's wrong picture of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not be put off because this Christ is beyond your understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The things of life are hard to explain but easy to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I don't understand about the vitamins contained in wheat and what good they do me, but it is easy for me to eat bread and get its nutritional value anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This Christ too I can partake of without understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>PARTAKING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christ is our portion, our life, and our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How can we touch Him?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Colossians says to "let the word of Christ dwell in you richly" 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The word "dwell" here is a more solid word in Greek than the word "abide"; its root means house.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are to let the word of Christ make its home in us; here is the key to enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Christ is abstract, mysterious, and intangible.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But the Bible is tangible, solid, and receivable.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Christ as the life-giving Spirit is embodied in the word of the Bible as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You can see now why it is so important to be in the Word daily.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However busy you are, you must begin your day in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Buy an alarm clock if you need one to help you to get up early enough to set aside at least ten minutes for the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then don't just read it; pray it with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Let the word of Christ thus make its home in you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>With Christ embodied in the Word and the Word embodied in you, you will live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you have not digested Him through His Word, how can you live Him?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When you are saturated with His Word, you will be saturated with Him.</S>
