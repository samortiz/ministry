   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF THE TRUTH GETTING PREPARED FOR THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All of the elders need to take the way of labor to bring all the saints into the truth and into their function in life for the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should still meet at the same time on the same day, but before we go to any meetings we need to get ourselves prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may spend five days to get yourself prepared for one meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You should first pray, Lord, I just present myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am one appointed by You and established by You to take the lead in this locality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I present myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Show me what You want to do, and I present and offer the entire church to You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Especially I give all the church meetings to You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lead me and guide me that I may know what to do and how to render the proper ministry which is full of life and full of light to Your saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you pray in such a way, I do believe that the Lord will lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He will lead you to present some crucial points in the book of 1 Corinthians, in the book of Romans, in the book of John, or in some other book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord s leading you has very much to do with your daily fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you are not one who fellowships with the Lord every day, regardless of how much you pray, your prayer may not work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There may not be an echo to your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When you pray as one who fellowships with the Lord all the time, though, there will be an echo and that echo is the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>HOW TO USE THE LIFE-STUDY MESSAGES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During the last two or three years I have been very much concerned as to how we can use all the groceries of the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In some meetings of the church a Life-study Message is read in the meeting, testimonies are given concerning the contents of this message, and prayers or hymns are offered which are related to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although this way of getting into the Life-studies works to a certain extent, it is not the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The best way is not to go through a book of the Bible verse by verse or to read the Life-study Message from the first line to the last line.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best way is to pick out the crucial points and to get into these crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you felt burdened from the Lord to study the book of 1 Corinthians the Lord might lead you to begin by picking up one crucial point in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Chapter one tells us that the Jews asked for signs and that the Greeks sought wisdom, but to we believers Christ is God s power and God s wisdom vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>22-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ was made wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption v. 30 . This is one crucial point in chapter one of 1 Corinthians for you to study and get yourself into.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You should get yourself into this crucial point until you are mingled with it and constituted with it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then when you go to the meetings you can stress this crucial point in 1 Corinthians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not occupy the entire time of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Stress this point, but leave time for others to say something.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You also have to make it clear that we are not just studying something for spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are studying the riches of Christ for our daily experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Encourage the saints to concentrate themselves on this crucial point during the week.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They should concentrate themselves on Christ being God s wisdom and power to us and God having put us into Christ, who became wisdom to us as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The saints should be encouraged to experience and enjoy this crucial point day by day and hour after hour during the week.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their assignment for the week would be to study, to learn, and to experience and enjoy this crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the saints come back to the next meeting a number of them will have the experience of this crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many times in the past the saints gave testimonies merely of their experiences with seemingly nothing related to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By experiencing, enjoying, and laboring on a crucial point of the truth for an entire week, the saints will give testimonies not merely of their experiences, but of their experiences wrapped up with the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their testimonies will be a mingling of the divine Word with their experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we practiced in this way for one year, helping the saints to get into one crucial point a week, the result would be marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Fifty-two crucial points will have been deposited into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These crucial points are all deeper truths in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1 Corinthians the first deeper truth is Christ being given to us by God as our wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have been put into Him, so He is now our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What a deeper truth this is!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This truth will be worked into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They will live this truth, they will enjoy this truth, and they will experience this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All of the saints will be getting into the deeper knowledge of the deeper truths week by week.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the Lord s day morning meeting and in the home meetings during that week the saints should concentrate themselves on one crucial point of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You do not need to be concerned about their repeating something.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Peter spoke on the day of Pentecost and in the homes all the believers repeated Peter s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to build up an atmosphere in the local churches where nobody feels shameful to repeat another s word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, we would all learn to speak the same thing 1 Cor 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To practice in the way that we have described requires a much deeper exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For one crucial point you may need to go to some lexicon to study the Greek word for wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This kind of study is not for the mere knowing of the New Testament in the way of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But there is a need for us to find out the real denotation or significance of certain crucial words used in God s holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You may need to study the Greek words for wisdom, power, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then you will need to get the help from the Life-study Messages on this particular crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After half a year, twenty-six crucial points will have been put out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some among you may pick up a burden to write a lesson book on these twenty-six crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This lesson book could be used in your summer school to teach the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This needs a lot of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Just by this one illustration, you could see how much labor you brothers need to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the elders merely to make the schedule for the church meetings and expect somebody to speak when the church gathers together does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Everybody wants to speak, but no one has anything to speak about.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By laboring in a crucial point of the truth, you create something for the saints to speak about.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why I say again do not take the easy, short-cut way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all need to take the way of labor for the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you practice like this week after week, month after month, and year after year, consider what the issue will be in your locality after four years.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The issue will be something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After four years, two hundred and eight crucial points will have been covered.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you were to cover all the crucial points in 1 Corinthians in this way, this book would become transparent and clear to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You may decide to pick up just one crucial point in each chapter of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you get through 1 Corinthians, even though you did not read it verse by verse and you did not read all the Life-studies line by line, you will have acquired a bird s-eye-view of this book, and this book will have been deposited into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After fifteen years of this kind of study and endeavor, many of the young ones among us will have a rich deposit of the truth in them and some of them will have been raised up by the Lord to be the proper leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Regretfully, you do not have that much of a deposit of the truth in you because no one practiced in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You only received the raw groceries from the Life-studies, but you did not know how to cook the Life-studies in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you were to go to the store and buy many groceries and pass them on to me, I would not know how to cook them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In like manner, we all have the divine groceries of the Life-study Messages, but we all need to be trained to cook them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord has given us the Holy Bible, the Word, and His Holy Spirit always goes along with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we preach the Word, the Spirit honors this.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Baptist denomination is the one who uses the Bible the most among all the big denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>According to a 1984 statistic concerning American and Canadian churches, the Catholic church has fifty-two million members and the Baptists are second with twenty-five and a half million members.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Catholic church has been on this earth for at least fifteen centuries while the Baptists have been existing for about four centuries at the most.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Despite this the Baptists have nearly half the membership as the Catholic church does in America and Canada.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This statistic shows us the power of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The third biggest group is the Methodists with approximately thirteen million members.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Especially in their earlier days, the Methodist denomination used the Bible very much.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Based upon the foundation that John Wesley laid, the Methodist denomination used to use the Bible to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Among all the churches of the Pentecostal movement, the one with the greatest number of members is the Assembly of God.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The reason for this is because they used the Bible to establish their assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>These statistics show us that the best way for the Lord s children to take is to use the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we brothers would be so faithful to use the Word as I have suggested to you in this chapter, after ten years all the teenagers among us will be good Bible teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We will have a younger generation filled up and saturated with all the divine truths in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It is altogether worthwhile for us to labor in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I assure you that this is the best way not just to use the Bible in the way of knowledge but in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We can use the notes of the Recovery Version plus the Life-study Messages in order to dive into the crucial points of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The notes of the Recovery Version and the Life-studies are a mine that requires much digging on your part.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Going to these two sources will save you much time.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If you get into these mines you will see something more and something higher.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Take the way of laboring on the crucial points of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>You should even take this way for the gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Some of the brothers can testify that when they preach the gospel using the high, deeper truths, they have been warmly welcomed.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This kind of preaching will capture the higher class, highly educated people on the college campuses.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I believe that what I have presented to you in this chapter is an endless way to get into the truths of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>You can drive on this highway in a free way, but you do have the heavenly white lines to restrain you.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is exactly what the Lord needs in order for Him to build up the church upon the high revelation of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If you were to pick up the crucial points from the book of 1 Corinthians, you would be occupied with this book at least sixteen weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Think about how high this would be.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>All the saints should be encouraged to speak these crucial points in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We need to talk to the children, to our parents, to our relatives, neighbors, and colleagues concerning these crucial points of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>During the whole week we should concentrate our talking and speaking on this one crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Then the next week we could go on to another crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I believe we all would see a tremendous improvement and change in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If you would pick up the crucial points of a certain chapter, all the rest of the verses would be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Do not forget, however, that to take this way will make you busy.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>You will have nearly no time to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If you labor in such a way, the Lord will send a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Forget about all the problems in your church and go back to do this one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This one thing will swallow up all the death.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>You do not need to control the church, but these truths will control your church.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Bring your church under this heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>When there is no vision, the people run wild.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>You must render the vision to the saints under your care.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>THE NEED OF FULL-TIME WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>To labor in this way there is the need of full-time workers.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>In every church there is the need of some full-timers to spend more time on the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>It would be hard to have a full-time job and bear the responsibility for the church meetings by laboring on the Word in this way to bring the saints into the crucial points of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If we do go full-time for the Lord we may suffer poverty, but this is still worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>All of us have to endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>If we will be so busy in the Lord s interest, many saints will follow us to get into the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>If we take the short-cut, lazy way, the saints will also take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>May the Lord grace us all to take the way of labor to get into the crucial points of the truth in the divine revelation.</S>
