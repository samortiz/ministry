   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE NECESSITY FOR PRAYER TO BE IN RESURRECTION I. THE INDICATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Beginning with chapter thirteen, we have been dealing with the various aspects of prayer based on the Old Testament types.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have covered the matter concerning the cross and prayer based on the relationship between the offering altar and the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have covered the matter of life supply and prayer based on the relationship between the showbread table and the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Based on the relationship between the golden lampstand and the incense altar, we have also covered the matter of life illumination and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now, based on the type of the incense altar itself, we shall see the necessity for prayer to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In spiritual experience, the outer court of the tabernacle denotes the earth, the earthly aspect; whereas, the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies denote the heavens, the heavenly aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever is heavenly is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The showbread table signifies that the Lord is our bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is of the heavenly aspect and is, therefore, in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The golden lampstand indicates that the Lord is our light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is also of the heavenly aspect and in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The incense altar which denotes man's prayer before God is entirely something in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever the Bible speaks of man going before God to burn the incense, it invariably refers to man going before God to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, in the beginning of the Gospel of Luke, it says that Zacharias, the father of John the Baptist, entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then it refers to the people praying outside at the hour of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Also, Revelation chapters five and eight tell us that the burning of incense before God is the prayer of the saints ascending to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, to burn the incense is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among the spices that are burnt on the incense altar, the principal one is frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Bible, frankincense specifically signifies resurrection, just as myrrh denotes death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The frankincense which is burnt on the incense altar is a symbol of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the sweet-smelling savor ascends, there is altogether an atmosphere in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, according to the type in the Old Testament, man going before God to burn incense is entirely a matter in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that man's prayers before God must be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we are praying on earth today, strictly speaking, every prayer must be in the position of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And although we who pray are humans, every prayer needs to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For our prayer to be acceptable to God and be considered by God as a sweet-smelling savor, it must be in ascension and in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no burning of incense, no prayer, at the offering altar.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the incense must be burnt at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I believe this picture in typology is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the tabernacle setting one must pass through the offering altar, the laver, the showbread table, and the lampstand, and then arrive at the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This entire picture is for one thing: that man may go before God to burn incense, that is, to utter prayers before God by drawing near to God and contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such prayer is absolutely in resurrection.</S>
