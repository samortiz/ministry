   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWTH IN LIFE REVEALED IN MATTHEW 13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The growth in life is revealed in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter the Lord Jesus told us that He came not as a teacher but as a Sower to sow Himself as the seed of life into us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must drop the concept that we can be wonderful, spiritual Christians by collecting knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We must be revolutionized in our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord came as a Sower, and He sowed Himself into us as the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Matthew 13, after this sowing, we all need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first parable in Matthew 13 reveals the sower vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the second parable the seed sown grows up into wheat vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>24-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the fourth parable refers to fine flour vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>33-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fine flour comes from the grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These grains are good for making a loaf, and this loaf signifies the Body of Christ 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are many members yet one Body, one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the fifth and sixth parables a treasure is hidden in a field, and a merchant finds a pearl of great value vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In principle, the treasure hidden in the field must be composed of gold and precious stones, items which are transformed substances.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These transformed items are the materials for building the house of God 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the producing of the church we need growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we can have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The growth is for transformation, and transformation is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GROWTH IN LIFE BY FEEDING, NOT BY TEACHINGS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many in Christianity hold the wrong concept that teachings are needed for growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christianity cares too much for teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan is very subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In fundamental Christianity he has used dead teachings to cover people's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Teachings upon teachings are like layers upon layers covering people's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more they study theology, commentaries, and expositions, the more they are blinded, covered, and veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>More than thirty years ago I had many layers of veils over my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It took more than fifteen years for all the veils to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To grow in life we need feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regardless of how much we teach others to grow, no growth will take place.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Teaching does not help the growth, but feeding does.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must help the brothers and sisters to eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 4:14 says, "Tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not say by the "wind of heresy" but by the "wind of teaching."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This teaching is not false doctrine but good, sound, scriptural, and fundamental doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is doctrine as wind that carries people away from the Body, from the church, and from the Head, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Lord's recovery He has released us and freed us to come back to Himself and to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now in the church I am so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Forty years ago I was distracted by knowledge, but praise the Lord, now I am liberated and recovered!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I do not care for mere doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I only care for Christ and the church, for the Head and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE GIFTS NOT HELPING US TO GROW IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The exercise of the gifts does not help our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people consider that we need gifts such as divine healing, but for a person to receive divine healing will not help him to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some using 1 Corinthians 14:4 say that tongue-speaking edifies people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if we check into the tongue-speaking practiced today, much of it is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some people lay hands on others, telling them to say, "Praise Jesus," quickly over and over, or to speak nonsensical syllables.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be honest, this kind of speaking in tongues does not help people to grow.</S>
