   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Even when a man is soulish, many times he still realizes the uncertainties of this life and seeks for eternal life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, man can never find the truth of life through his mind or by theories.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These are unreliable means.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most of the time, clever people hold divergent views.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Theories are liable to lead men to errors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are castles in the air and lead men to nothing but eternal darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Indeed, unless intellectual power comes under the leading of the Holy Spirit, it is unreliable and is very dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It will take right as wrong and wrong as right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If one is not careful, he will not only suffer temporary loss but will suffer permanent damage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The dark thoughts of man usually lead him into the place of eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It would be well for the unregenerated soulish man to know this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet when man is fleshly, not only is he under the rule of the soul, but his soul is actually joined to his body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times, the soul is even directed by the body to commit the vilest sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The body of sin is full of cravings and lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was created out of the dust of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, its inclinations and motives are all earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the serpent's poison has entered into man's body, its legitimate desires have now become lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the soul once obeyed the body to rebel against God's demand, it has to continue its obedience to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At such times, the lusts of the body express themselves in many forms of sin through the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The authority of this body is so great that it causes the soul to become powerless to withstand it and only be its obedient slave.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man is divided into three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's original intention is that the spirit remain on top to rule over the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After man became soulish, the spirit was suppressed and became a servant to the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After man became carnal, the flesh, which occupied the lowest place, became the king.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man was changed from spirit-ruled to soul-ruled, and from soul-ruled to body-ruled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Step by step he became fallen, and the flesh took control.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What a pity this is!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sin has killed the spirit, and now spiritual death has come to all men so that all men die in sin and transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sin has also caused the soul to become independent so that the soulish life now becomes an independent and selfish life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, sin has empowered the body so that now the sinful nature reigns through the body.</S>
