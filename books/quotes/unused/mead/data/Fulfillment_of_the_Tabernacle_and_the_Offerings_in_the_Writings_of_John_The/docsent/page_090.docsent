   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE "I AM"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus is the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His name is I Am, the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 8:58 the Lord said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I Am."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord as the great I Am is the eternal, ever-existing God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, He is before Abraham and greater than Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The words "I Am" are related to the verb "to be."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be is to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In His creation, God called things into being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, God did not make anything, but rather called everything into being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Romans 4:17 Paul speaks of God as the One who "calls the things not being as being."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For something to be called into being is for that thing to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At one time there was no light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that light did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then God said, "Let there be light," and light came to be; that is, it came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you know who God is?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is the unique I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the unique One who has being, the great "To Be."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We, on the contrary, are not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In ourselves, we do not have any being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the verb "to be" can be applied only to God and not to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to realize that we are nothing, that in ourselves we do not have any being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you know what it means to be nothing?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It means that you are not, that the words "I am" and "to be" cannot be applied to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only God is the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only He has being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is the universal To Be, the genuine being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Apart from Him, nothing else has any being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, everything is vanity; everything is nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Pharisees asked the Lord who He was, He replied by saying, "I Am."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here the Lord seemed to be saying, "I Am that I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am the unique being; I am the To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But you scribes and Pharisees are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You are nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am the eternal One, the only One who is, the only One who is real."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only the I Am is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because He is the To Be, He is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Anything that does not have being cannot have any reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever does not have being is empty, vain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because only God is the I Am, Solomon could say that all things are "vanity of vanities."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only One is the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have seen that in 8:58 the Lord Jesus speaks of Himself as I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This expression is used two other times in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 24 the Lord Jesus said, "Unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I Am is the meaning of the name Jehovah Exo 3:14 , and Jehovah is the name of God in relation to man Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, it denotes the Lord as the ever-existing God in relation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If any man does not believe that the Lord is this very God, that man will die in his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In verse 28 the Lord went on to say, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>" THE REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 8:32 the Lord says, "And you shall know the reality, and the reality shall set you free."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Reality is not the so-called truth of doctrine, but the reality of the truth which is the Lord Himself 14:6; 1:14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 32 says that the reality will set us free.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But verse 36 says, "If then the Son shall set you free, you shall be really free."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This proves that the Son, the Lord Himself, is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since the Lord is the embodiment of God Col 2:9 , He is the reality of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, reality is the element of God realized by us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Lord as the great I Am comes into us as life, He shines within us as light, and this light brings the divine element as reality into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord is the reality because He is the I Am, because He is the To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, reality is the I Am, the To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The reality that sets us free is this I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The great To Be sets us free.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This One is Jehovah, the One who was, who is, and who will be.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Jesus is this very Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The name Jesus means Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, Jesus is the great I Am, the great To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because He is the To Be, He is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord told the scribes and the Pharisees, "Before Abraham came into being, I am" v. 58 . The past tense is used for Abraham, but the present tense is used for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Grammatically speaking, the Lord's word seems to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We would not say, "Before you came, I am."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Instead, we would say, "Before you came, I was here."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, it is altogether correct for the Lord to say, "Before Abraham came into being, I am."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord is the ever-existing One.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Before Abraham came into being, He was already the I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This great I Am, the eternal To Be, is the reality.</S>
