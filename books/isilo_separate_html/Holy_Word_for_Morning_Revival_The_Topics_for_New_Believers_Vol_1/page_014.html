We must call on Him out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22). Our heart, which is the source of our calling, must be pure, seeking nothing except the Lord Himself. Also, we must call with [purified lips] (Zeph. 3:9 [NASB]). We need to watch our speech, for nothing contaminates our lips more than loose talk. If our lips are impure due to loose talk, it will be difficult for us to call on the Lord....Furthermore, we need to call on the Lord corporately. Second Timothy 2:22 says, &#8220;But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&#8221; We need to come together for the purpose of calling on the name of the Lord. Psalm 88:9 says, &#8220;I have called out to You, O Jehovah, every day.&#8221; Hence, we should call daily upon His name. Furthermore, Psalm 116:2 says, &#8220;Therefore I will call upon Him all my days.&#8221; As long as we live, we should call on the name of the Lord.<sup>59</sup></p><h2 class="head1">Enjoying, Breathing, and Drinking the Lord</h2><p>To call on the Lord is to enjoy the Lord, to breathe the Lord in. Calling is just breathing. Jeremiah was designated the &#8220;weeping prophet.&#8221; After the book of Jeremiah, he felt he was not finished, so he wrote Lamentations as a weeping book. In this weeping book there are two wonderful, joyful verses: &#8220;I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit. / You have heard my voice; do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry&#8221; (3:55-56). Our calling is our breathing....Sometimes our dear husband or wife or our children put us into &#8220;the lowest pit.&#8221; Whenever you get into &#8220;the lowest pit,&#8221; do not murmur or complain. Simply call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; and you will be in the third heaven. To call on the Lord is just to breathe Him in. Verse 56 says, &#8220;Do not hide / Your ear at my breathing, at my cry.&#8221; The Lord turns His ear to our breathing. This spiritual breathing is our calling, &#8220;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&#8221;<sup>60</sup></p><p>The secret to enjoying the Spirit is found in 1 Corinthians 12:13. We all must believe that we have experienced the first half of 1 Corinthians 12:13. In one Spirit, that is, in the Spirit, we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks. The Spirit and the Body are connected. We must believe that we believers of the Lord were in that one Spirit baptized into one Body....Since you believe that you are in the Body, then you must also believe that you are in the Spirit....We have all been baptized into the Spirit, and now we need to drink this Spirit.<sup>61</sup></p><p>The way to drink is in verse 3 of the same chapter: &#8220;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This is similar to saying, &#8220;No one can breathe except that the air gets into him.&#8221; Can we say that we are breathing, but the air never comes in? When we breathe, the air comes in....If we say, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; we are in the Spirit. This is drinking. The way we drink of the Spirit is by saying, &#8220;O Lord Jesus.&#8221;</p><p>Hymn #73 in Hymns was written by Miss M. E. Barber, an older sister who helped Brother Watchman Nee very much. Stanza 2 says, &#8220;Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior! / In Thy Name is all I need; / Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed.&#8221;...To call on the name of the Lord is to breathe Him, and to breathe Him is to drink Him. The way to drink of the one Spirit is to call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221;...If you are thirsty, call on the Lord. At any time or any place, even while we are driving, we may be thirsty. Then we may call on the Lord and receive the living water. Try it; it always works....This is very simple, and this is our Christian life. Our Christian life must be a calling life.<sup>62</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>	 	 	 	<p class="bold">WEEK 2 - HYMN</p><h2 class="uhead1">Hymns, #611</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>God&#8217;s glorious substance Spirit is,<br>His essence, holy and divine;<br>To contact God and Him enjoy,<br>His Spirit I must touch with mine.<br><br></li><li>The spirit is the innermost,<br>The part of man most deep and real;<br>If he would contact God in life,<br>&#8217;Tis with the spirit he must deal.<br><br></li><li>The worship which the Father seeks<br>Is in the spirit&#8217;s strength alone;<br>His Spirit into man&#8217;s would come,<br>That His and man&#8217;s may thus be one.<br><br></li><li>When Spirit unto spirit calls<br>The two commingle and are one;<br>Man&#8217;s spirit is the Spirit&#8217;s home,<br> The Spirit doth man&#8217;s life become.<br><br></li><li>Man&#8217;s spirit must God&#8217;s Spirit touch<br>If in God&#8217;s fulness he would live;<br>&#8217;Tis only with the spirit thus<br>That he to God may worship give.<br><br></li><li>In ministry and fellowship<br>Man to the spirit we must bring;<br>All ministry should turn to prayer,<br>Spirit to spirit answering.<br><br></li><li>In spirit we must pray and serve,<br>In spirit touch the life divine,<br>In spirit grow, in spirit build,<br>That Christ thru us may fully shine.<br><br></li><li>Lord, to the spirit I would turn<br>And learn to truly contact Thee;<br>Thy Spirit thus will flow with mine<br>And overflow eternally.</li></ol><h2 class="uhead1">Hymns, #73</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>Glorious, mighty Name of Jesus,<br>Into Thy dear Name I flee;<br>&#8220;Set aloft,&#8221; I praise and worship,<br>For Thy Name is victory!<br><br></li><li>Blessed Jesus!
