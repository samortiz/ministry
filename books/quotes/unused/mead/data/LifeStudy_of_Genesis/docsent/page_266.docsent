   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE FORTY-TWO THE TRIAL OF THE CALLED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to Abraham's experience of trials.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen how Abraham was called by God and how, by God's appearing, he was strengthened to answer that call.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have also seen that, by God's appearing, Abraham was brought to the very place where God intended him to be.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Firstly he was brought to Shechem 12:6 and then to the place between Bethel and Ai, the place between the house of God and the heap of ruins 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That place between the house of God and the heap of ruins was the high point, and Abraham should have remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, suddenly, after such a high attainment in his experience of God, Abraham continued his journey, going toward the south 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In studying this chapter, I have spent much time to find out the reason why Abraham continued his journey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why did he journey on and not remain there between the house of God and the heap of ruins?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Abraham had attained the high point, the place where God intended for him to be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By God's mercy, he should have remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Abraham journeyed southward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that he went downward.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After such a high attainment in the experience of God, any journey would be downward.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This continuing of his journey was the cause of Abraham's failure.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that, at the beginning, Abraham dragged his feet through mud and water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, he was victorious, going all the way to Shechem and afterward to the place near Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In both of those places he built an altar and at the place between Bethel and Ai he also called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent as a declaration to the whole world that he was an anti-testimony to the situation at Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you not think that in doing so Abraham had arrived, attained the high point of his experience of God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps you are thinking that if you had been Abraham, you surely would have remained there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we should not think this way, for we are today's Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The ancient Abraham was just like us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have pointed out elsewhere, Abraham's experience was a seed of our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The record of Abraham in Genesis is his biography, but it is our autobiography.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may say, "No, it is Abraham's autobiography and my biography."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this record is your autobiography not your biography, because the biography of Abraham was written by Moses and your biography is written by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abraham's experience corresponds with ours.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We and he are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Have you not had a wonderful time with the Lord in which you reached the high point and shouted, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How good it is here!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No place is better than this place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the best place for me to be."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Have you not said this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But what happened the very next day?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You began to journey downward.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The night before you said, "Hallelujah, this is the place for me," and the next morning you began to journey downward to the border of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that you journeyed to a place that was so close to the world, close to the movie theaters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One night you were on the high point in Canaan and the next morning you were moving downward to the border of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Has this not happened to you?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am so happy and surprised to hear the junior high young people offer such wonderful prayers in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But I need to say an honest word to them; I do not trust you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After praying such a wonderful prayer one night in the meeting, the next morning you may journey downward to the border of worldly entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today you may say, "Hallelujah, this is the best place for me," and next weekend you may move downward to the movie theater.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Remember that we are today's Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is easy to reach the high point, but it is not easy to remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is not much room on the high point.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you move just slightly, you will fall downhill.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is very difficult to keep the God-appointed position.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The high point is surrounded by pits, and it is easy to fall into one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The called ones will not usually go backward, but it is easy for them to go downward into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Abraham never went back to Chaldea, but he did go down into Egypt.</S>
