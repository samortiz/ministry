   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In Beer-sheba close to the land of the Philistines The well for Isaac was in Beer-sheba, close to the land of the Philistines vv.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>25-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This well, unlike the well for Ishmael, is not near Egypt but at the border of the land of the Philistines and the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beer-sheba was in the land of the Philistines and later became the southernmost part of the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When describing the geography of the Holy Land, the Bible even uses the phrase "from Dan to Beer-sheba" 1 Sam 3:20 , because the distance from Dan in the north to Beer-sheba in the south includes the whole land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible the land of the Philistines has a peculiar significance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not a place which rejects God absolutely; it is a place which accepts God but handles the things of God according to human cleverness, not according to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Consider as an illustration the way in which the Philistines handled the ark 1 Sam 6:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did not reject it; they received it, but they handled it in a natural way according to their cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, in Genesis 20 and 21 we see that Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, did not reject God but accepted Him in his own clever way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Abraham took God according to His economy; Abimelech took Him according to the way of human cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the significance of the land of the Philistines.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the cost of seven ewe lambs Christ's complete redemption The well for Isaac was a redeemed well vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>28-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This well, which Abraham had dug, was lost, having been violently taken away by Abimelech's servants v. 25 . Then Abraham redeemed it at the cost of seven ewe lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In typology, these lambs signify the full redemption of Christ, indicating that the divine living water has been redeemed, bought back, by Christ's full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today, while the whole human race is living by a source which is without redemption, we are living by a redeemed source.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The living water which we are drinking today is not natural; it has been redeemed at the cost of Christ's complete redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By a covenant the new covenant The well for Isaac also needed a covenant vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The covenant here is a seed of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our living water today is not only redeemed water but also covenanted water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Ishmael drank of wild water, water that was without redemption and covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But all the water which Isaac drank was redeemed water, the water of the covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since we have begun to know Christ, the source of our living has also been the redeemed and covenanted water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For planting In Beer-sheba Abraham planted a tamarisk tree v. 33, Heb . A tamarisk, a type of willow tree, has very fine leaves, often grows near water, and gives the impression of the flowing of the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That Abraham planted a tamarisk after making the covenant for the well at Beer-sheba indicates that the water of which he drank was flowing in a rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus said that whoever believes in Him will have rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church life today is by the well in Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you drink of this well and live by it, you will be like a tamarisk flowing with the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever people come to you, they will never sense dryness but will be refreshed by the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Beer-sheba, which means "the well of an oath," is the place where the church should be.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church should be at the well of an oath with a covenant, and should also be full of tamarisk trees.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all need to be a flowing tamarisk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you look at the branches of a tamarisk tree, they will remind you of the flowing of the riches of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord that there are some real tamarisks in the local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here, at Beer-sheba, there is the planting, but with Ishmael in the wilderness there is wildness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christian groups today are like a wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They only make people wild.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the proper church life causes people to be planted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Have you been planted?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once you have been planted, you can no longer be wild.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this section of the Word it is clearly revealed that there are two sources of living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One is the natural source in the wilderness of our soul, whereas the other is the redeemed source in the garden of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At Beer-sheba, Abraham was contending for the well which had been so violently taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today we also need to fight for the divine well that we may have it for both the Christian life and the proper church life.</S>
