   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE BELIEVER TOWARDS THE FLESH GOD'S VIEW OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this time, it would be good for the believers to refresh their memory concerning God's verdict on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus said, "The flesh profits nothing" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the sins of the flesh and the righteousnesses of the flesh are of no profit!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All that is born of the flesh, regardless what it may be, is flesh and can never become "non-flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether it be the flesh in preaching, the flesh in listening, the flesh in praying, the flesh in offering, the flesh in reading the Scripture, the flesh in singing the hymns, or the flesh in doing good, God has told us that all these have no profit!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No matter how much the believers trust the flesh, God has said it is of no profit and does not help the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flesh cannot fulfill the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"For the mind set on the flesh is death" Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From God's point of view, there is spiritual death in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no other way except to commit the flesh to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No matter how capable the flesh is of doing good, of thinking and planning, and of gaining the commendation of man, in God's eyes, all that originates from the flesh has the inscription in capital letters, "DEATH."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God" Rom 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The flesh is completely against God and has no possibility of being mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not only so with the evils which originate from the flesh, but even the most noble thoughts and conduct from the flesh are enmity against God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even doing righteous deeds, not to mention committing sins, is doing them independently, apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"For it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be" Rom 8:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The better one does, the farther away he is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the world, how many good men are willing to believe in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, self-righteousness is not righteousness; it is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No matter what, man himself can never do what is taught in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether good or evil, he is never subject to God's restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he is evil, he offends the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he is good, he sets up another righteousness apart from the Lord Jesus and loses the original purpose of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"For through the law is the clear knowledge of sin" 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"And those who are in the flesh cannot please God" Rom 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the final resolution.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No matter how good man's conduct may be, if it originates from the self, it can never please God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God can only be pleased by His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Aside from Him and His work, neither man nor man's work can please God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is done by his own flesh may seem to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, because it is done by his own strength and originates from his self, God is not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man can think up many ways to do good deeds, to improve, and to advance, but since these actions originate from the flesh, God is not pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This not only applies to the unregenerated man, but also to the regenerated believer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If he has accomplished something on his own, no matter how good and how effective the work is, God can never be pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is God's pleasure or displeasure is not a matter of good or evil but a matter of the source.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The conduct may be quite good, but where does it come from?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Having read these few verses, we can really see how vain man's conduct according to flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Believers should see God's evaluation of the flesh precisely; then they will not err.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we human beings make a distinction between good and evil concerning behavior, the distinction God makes is not limited to behavior but also touches the source.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before God, a very defiled, evil deed is the same as the most excellent work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both are of the flesh and cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To the same degree that God hates unrighteousness, He also hates self-righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before God, all the natural good deeds that a man can do not through regeneration, union with Christ, and dependence on the Holy Spirit are no less of the flesh than adultery, corruption, and licentiousness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No matter how excellent man's good deeds may be, unless they originate from complete dependence on His Holy Spirit, they are of the flesh and are rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Regardless of the outward appearance of the flesh and regardless whether the flesh is of the sinners or of His believers, God opposes, rejects, and hates everything that is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His decision is that the flesh must die.</S>
