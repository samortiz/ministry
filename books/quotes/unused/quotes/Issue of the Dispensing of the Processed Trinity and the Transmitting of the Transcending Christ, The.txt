Prayer: Lord, we treasure Your blessing; we treasure Your presence; and we treasure Your Spirit, Your blood, and Your word
The Father's dispensing in His choosing and predestinating issues in His many sons as His house in sanctification Eph
The Son's dispensing in His redeeming and saving issues in the believers as God's inheritance in transformation Eph
The Spirit's dispensing in His sealing and pledging issues in God as the believers' inheritance unto their perfection Eph
The transcending Christ's transmitting in His rising and ascending issues in His Body as His expression unto the believers' consummation Eph
The title of this book is The Issue of the Dispensing of the Processed Trinity and the Transmitting of the Transcending Christ
Also, Christ today is in the highest place in the universe as the transcending One to transmit Himself to the church, His Body
The title of this first chapter is 'The Issue of God the Father's Dispensing Speaking Forth God's Eternal Purpose'
Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God so that God can produce many sons
In the entire Bible there is not the word Trinity or the title the Triune God, but there is such a fact in the Bible
We have seen that the Triune God, for the fulfillment of His intention so that He can be satisfied in His desire, did something wonderful
John 1 says that Christ gives the believing ones, those who receive Him, the right, the authority, to be the children of God
These parables depict the threefold grace of the Triune God for a sinner to be received back into the Father's house
The Father's dispensing in His choosing and predestinating issues in many sons to form God's household in sanctification
The Son's dispensing in His redeeming and His saving issues in a heritage to God, a treasure to God, as God's private possession
That means all the many sons who issued from the Father's dispensing will become a treasure to God as His heritage
The Spirit's dispensing in His sealing and pledging issues in God as the believers' inheritance unto their perfection
The many sons, God's heritage, our inheritance, and the transmitting of the transcending Christ culminate in the church, the Body of Christ
The choosing of God's people for them to be holy is for the purpose of their being made sons of God, participating in the divine sonship
In Matthew 23 the Lord Jesus said that the gold is made holy sanctified by the temple and that the gift is made holy sanctified by the altar
The teaching of the Brethren concerning positional sanctification is scriptural, but this is not the entire truth concerning sanctification
Sanctification is to separate God's people unto God for God to work on them and to work in them to make them His sons
We have God's holy nature imparted into our being, and this holy nature becomes the holy element with which we are made holy
After our birth, we need to grow in the life of Christ, in the divine life, in the eternal life, with the proper nourishment in the Spirit
As long as we have our being by the Spirit and act according to the Spirit, we are ready to grow in the divine life
We can be nourished in these three ways: by reading the holy Word, by listening to the spiritual speaking, and by coming to the meetings
We still need some revelation to see the right way to grow in the divine life according to the New Testament teaching
When the parents are with their children, they have to behave themselves according to the Spirit in order to be kept in the divine life
They may be afraid of making mistakes when they talk to others, but they do not have any care when they speak to their children
We have to be regulated, corrected, and adjusted by saying everything and doing everything according to the Spirit
Although they say that they love the Lord, love the recovery, and love the church life, they do not care a bit for the Spirit
They have been regenerated, and they love the Lord, love the recovery, and love the church, but they just would not speak
Your spirit will tell you that you are stubborn and that you should go along with the church to speak for the Lord
Day by day, however, we do not live in our sonship, because we do not care for the sanctifying Spirit speaking and working in our spirit
The blessings in Ephesians 1 start from God's choosing for us to be sanctified that we might be more and more in the sonship of God
We will have a stronger and richer church life as we continue to take care of the divine sanctification for the sonship by the Spirit
In these verses there are the many sons of God, God's heritage, and our glorified body, but the church is not yet mentioned
The dispensing of the processed Trinity produces the constituents for the church but there is still the need for the formation of the church
Without these two spirits the Holy Spirit and our spirit there is no possibility to have the coming out of the church
The concluding notes of chapter one of this book point out that the divine sanctification is unto the divine sonship
At the juncture we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, the same Spirit, the seeking Spirit, sanctified us further by regenerating us
The Father put Christ's redeeming blood upon us, just like the loving father put the best robe upon the returned prodigal son
All our offenses have been forgiven through the blood, the redemption of Christ, and our spirit has been regenerated
We were regenerated, sanctified unto God, in our spirit, but we need the sanctifying Spirit's further work to sanctify our soul
For us to be transformed, we need some new element added into us to carry away our old element and replace us with the new element
The sanctifying Spirit in God's sanctification first sought us out and then regenerated us, making us sons of God
We are not only the children of God, we are not only the sons of God, we are not only the heirs of God, but we are also the 'baby gods'
Our being made holy results in our being made sons of God, making us God in life and in nature, but not in the Godhead
Through God's abounding grace, Christ accomplished redemption for us, and this redemption is for the forgiveness of our offenses
God, according to His desire with an intention, made an economy, and the center of the divine economy is God's desire to have many sons
All the evil things, such as murder, fornication, stealing, cheating, and lying, show that today's world is in an upside-down situation
God became a man to solve all the problems, to terminate all the negative things in the whole earth and even in the whole universe
Many Christians today do not believe that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, nor do they believe that they have a spirit
He is the life-giving Spirit to execute His covenant, to carry out what He has accomplished through His all-inclusive death
He is transforming us metabolically making us a particular treasure to become Gods private possession even Gods heritage Gods inheritance
We are the Jesus lovers, who are willing in Christ's redemption to be transformed by the sanctifying Spirit to be made right-side up
We all have seen that the first main point in Ephesians 1 is the threefold dispensing of the processed Divine Trinity
For the firstfold dispensing there are only two verses, but for the secondfold dispensing of the Son, there are verses 7 through 12
He is also the element by and with which we are being renewed and transformed to be a treasure, a heritage of worth, to God
We were in the collapse as God's enemies, but Christ redeemed us out from Adam, from sin, and from the collapse
The firstfold dispensing of the Divine Trinity is to produce sons, but we need the secondfold dispensing to redeem us back to God in Christ
The first stage was Christ's earthly ministry, from His incarnation to His crucifixion, that is, from His birth to His death
At the age of thirty He came out to minister for three and a half years, traveling back and forth between Galilee and Judea
He went to the cross and He died an all-inclusive death to solve all the problems in the universe between God and His creation
As the only begotten Son of God, He was divine, but in His first birth He picked up humanity and put it upon Himself
There was a problem: As a divine person He had a human part that was not divine and that had nothing to do with God's Son
When He finished His earthly ministry, at the time when He accomplished God's eternal redemption, He finished His work
Because His earthly ministry, that is, the ministry for the accomplishment of redemption, was finished, consummated, completed
On the one hand, the New Testament says that God raised Him up; on the other hand, it also says that He Himself rose up
In 1 Corinthians 15 a chapter that deals particularly with the matter of resurrection verse 45 says The last Adam became a lifegiving Spirit
At that time He asked His disciple Thomas, 'Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and put it into My side'
In His resurrection He was delivered as the firstborn Son of God, and we were delivered as the many sons of God
We all need to realize that the birth of the firstborn Son with the birth of the many sons created another world
We have been regenerated out of the human world and into another world that is spiritual, heavenly, and divine
Philippians 320 tells us that we are heavenly citizens and Ephesians 26 says that we have been seated together with Christ in the heavenlies
He accomplished redemption in His earthly ministry, but He applies this redemption to us in His heavenly ministry
If they were only in the heavens, how could we come forward to them, and how could we enter the Holy of Holies?
That ladder stretched from the earth to the heavens, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it
It brought the earth to the heavens and joined the heavens with the earth, making the heavens and the earth one
Because of this, when we speak the Lord's word in His ministry today, we speak not only on the earth but also in the heavens
A number of years ago one group of Christians declared that they followed only Jesus and they would not follow Paul
At the time when Christ went out of death and entered into resurrection, He imparted His divine life into all of us to regenerate us
He also strengthens us sustains us supports us comforts us supplies us takes care of our case in the heavenly court and intercedes for us
If we want to seal something, we must have a seal which bears a certain image, and we must also have the sealing ink
When a husband is about to exchange words with his wife, he should wait so that he can remain under the sealing for a while
He will rejoice because he has been soaked and saturated as a result of being under the sealing of the Lord as the life-giving Spirit
As this sealing proceeds, we even have the sense that our lust, our sickness, our weakness, and our deadness are being reduced
The clause 'were designated as an inheritance' literally means that in Christ we were designated as a chosen inheritance for God
The first section of the divine revelation presented to us in the book of Ephesians is the Triune God's triune dispensing
The three aspects of the Triune Gods triune dispensing are the three sections of the Holy Spirits sanctification performed in the believers
The Spirit's sanctification has very much to do with the Body of Christ, which is the issue of the Spirit's sanctifying work
All these are compounded in this consummation of the Triune God, which is the life-giving Spirit, and such a Spirit came to seal us
We should bear the Lord's testimony and expression in everything we do and in everything related to our person
After a short time, their clothing began to change, their long hair and beards were cut off, and they began to wear shoes
In the first fourteen verses of Ephesians 1 we see the threefold dispensing, from the Father's choosing to our being brought into glory
Eventually, as we remain under this dispensing, we will be matured and made ready to be transfigured in our body
The Spirit as the essence, the Lord as the element, and the Father as the source are constituted into this frame of humanity
We human beings created by God became fallen, so God came to redeem us to carry out His choosing and accomplish His purpose
In His ascension, He transcended above all the names, not only the big names opposing Christ and His church but also the small names
The book of Job tells us that Satan appeared in the third heaven before God at a heavenly council, accusing God's people
Hebrews 4:14 tells us that Christ passed through the heavens, and 7:26 tells us that He has become higher than the heavens
Compared to where Christ landed in His ascension, landing at the moon is like taking one step on a very high stairway
The Lord's recovery is still going on, and the Lord will not stop until He has accomplished His purpose according to His heart's desire
The divine dispensing is to constitute the Body of Christ, and the divine transmission is to form the Body of Christ
The consummation of the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit is all the time sealing us with His fine dispensing to transform us
For people to immigrate here was somewhat hard, but for these immigrated people to be formed into a nation was very hard
When you do something to follow the transcending Christ to form the church through His transmitting, you will have trouble
These one hundred twenty were the produce of the Father's choosing, of the Son's redeeming, and of the Spirit's sealing
On the day of Pentecost, the transcending Christ transmitted His transcending power to these one hundred twenty
On the day of Pentecost, the transcending Christ transmitted His transcending power into the one hundred twenty and they became the church
Christ said that He would come quickly, but He does not come quickly according to the way that many Christians think
The eyes of our heart need to be enlightened that we may see three things: God's calling, God's inheritance, and God's power
It is the transmitting of the transcending Christ that consummates the divine dispensing to its highest degree
The many sons of God, the heritage of worth, and the divine sonship to its fullest extent are all for the church, the Body of Christ
In union with this transcending Christ, we have surpassed all the negative things and transcended above them all
In union with such a Christ, we are participating all the time in all His success in His resurrection and ascension
The many sons, the heritage to God, and the glorification of the saints all come out of God's divine dispensing
Regretfully, many Christians deny that we have a spirit, yet Paul prayed that the Father may give to us a spirit
That means God in His economy through His dispensing will get an inheritance, a heritage of worth, and this heritage will be full of glory
Have we ever considered that as the church we are God's total reproduction, God's continuation, and God's rich surplus?
My burden is not to merely teach us the Bible but to present us a view so that we can really see what the church is
The Brethren strongly pointed out that the church is not a physical building but the gathering of God's called-out ones
We may be able to say that we are God's expression, but have we ever considered that we are God's continuation?
Such a high vision of the church needs us to pray, 'Lord, give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see and to know what Your church is'
Also, the consummation of the processed Triune God as the compound, all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit seals this heritage of God
Thus far, there has been only the producing of the materials, the components, the constituents, to constitute the Body of Christ
There is the need of the transmitting of the transcending Christ from the heavens, in the heavens, and with the heavens
The church was formed by the transmitting of the transcending Christ from the heavens, in the heavens, and with the heavens
Eventually, on the day of Pentecost, He poured out Himself upon all His components to make them one church, one Body
We need a spirit of wisdom to understand to this extent, and we need a spirit of revelation to see to this high standard
Some think that you cannot follow Jesus to the uttermost unless you go to the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized
The church is the organic Body of Christ, which is God's family, God's household, God's folks becoming His home, His dwelling place
If you have received the gift of a spirit of wisdom and of revelation, you will see that the church is just one
Today there is the Church of England, and the queen of England is the head of the Anglican church, the Episcopalian church
Some pursuers and lovers of Christ did not agree with the Catholic Church or the state churches, so they invented the private churches
Eventually, the Brethren rose up in England, and they stressed that the church should not be under anyone's control
Today there are also the Pentecostals who care only for speaking in tongues and miraculous gifts not for Gods desire to have His one church
God's economy is not for the purpose of having only individual believers to be saved, to be spiritual, and then to go to heaven
Praise the Lord and thank the Lord that we have seen the light to this extent, and we have been brought into the Lord's recovery
We have also seen that the way to carry out the Triune God's economy is by His threefold dispensing plus Christ's onefold transmitting
Our human spirit has been regenerated and indwelt by the compound, all-inclusive, consummated Spirit to make this spirit a mingled spirit
In 1:17 the apostle Paul prayed that the Father would give us such a mingled spirit of wisdom to understand and of revelation to see
We can see His economy and it is made known to us so that we can receive it, understand it, apprehend it, and participate in it
God needs a dwelling place, not just in the heavens but on the earth, and this dwelling place must be organic in our spirit
Ephesians 3:5 tells us that the economy of God, which is so mysterious, has been unveiled to the apostles and the prophets in their spirit
If we are going to understand, to realize, the reality of God's mysterious economy, we must learn to discern our spirit from our soul
Our spirit needs to be filled with the processed Triune God, with the transcending Christ, with the consummated Spirit
As we speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, as we are praising God, we will spontaneously be submissive to one another
On the one hand, the church life is a praising life and a submitting life; at the same time it is also a fighting life
While we are praising and submitting to one another, the enemy is here fighting, so we have to fight against him by prayer
We may be exercising our spirit to worship the Lord at His table, but afterward we may immediately turn to our mind
If we exercise our mind to consider and speak of the church life, we will say that the elders are not that good
We will understand why there is the need of the onefold transmission to follow the threefold dispensing of the Divine Trinity
In the recent past, there was a different teaching among us which said that the local church should be autonomous
Some may argue by saying, 'Brother Lee, didn't you say that the administration of the churches should be local and independent'?
The church in Anaheim depends upon the church in Fullerton, and the church in Fullerton depends upon the church in Anaheim
The churches may be different in their business affairs, but even in this matter they should not claim that they are independent
The leading ones there may claim that the local church has its own jurisdiction and that no one can interfere with them
The church in Santa Ana may ask, 'Why have you brothers in Anaheim made such a decision to meet at two o'clock in the morning'?
In this particular conference, we brothers came together before the meetings to pray and fellowship about certain things
The church in which you are meeting today may be in Spokane or in Anaheim, but we have to remember that these are just parts of the church
When all the churches come together for a conference, those who are coming from another city may not function in the conference
Certain brothers who live in the locality where the conference is held may function frequently because they think, 'This is my home church'
Minor things such as whether we use leavened or unleavened bread and wine or grape juice at the Lord's table will not matter
As long as we receive the threefold dispensing of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit, everything is okay
As long as we would stay under the transmission of the transcending Christ from the heavens, everything is okay
If the one brother was afraid to receive some sickness through the fly, the wise thing would have been not to say anything or do anything
If the parts of our physical body would keep their own jurisdiction and be autonomous, our body would be finished
Thank the Lord that all the members of our physical body are submissive to one another so that our body can act and operate smoothly
Without the Body, the church makes no sense, but with the Body, there is the intrinsic significance of the church
As far as Gods economy is concerned there is very little on this earth for the fulfilling of Gods intention according to His hearts desire
On the other hand, it is human to express the divine and human Christ, who is both the complete God and the perfect man
The genuine oneness of the Body of Christ is one crucial point of the Lord's recovery in this consummating age
We need a spirit of wisdom and revelation with the enlightening of the eyes of our heart to see and apprehend the Body of Christ
We have been distracted in many ways and affected by many things, and have even been to some extent captured by these things
At the same time You also unveiled to us how much You expect that we all could have a spirit of wisdom and revelation
While he was ministering to us the threefold dispensing and the unique transmitting, he prayed; he inserted a prayer into his ministry
Not only so, even in Galatians and Philippians Paul showed us that at his time there were not only divisions but also rivalries
Today it seems that there is not a person who is doing evil things to the degree that Alexander the coppersmith did evil to the apostle Paul
In this conference the Lord has shown us something further, deeper, higher, and richer in the book of Ephesians
In His birth as a man He kept all those ordinations, and then He remained in a poor carpenter's home for thirty years
Not only so, the Father subjected all things under His feet and gave Him a great gift, that is, to be the Head over all things to the church
All the constituents needed for the constituting of His organic Body were produced in the threefold dispensing of the Divine Trinity
The formation of the church as the Body of Christ was a great event on this earth, and even in the entire universe
Paul's prayer was just to stir up the hidden capacity so that we can understand God and His mysterious economy
No doubt the messages in this conference have stirred up our spiritual capacity, which we have by our spiritual birth
Lord, forgive me; until today my understanding of You and of the things concerning You has been altogether natural
In the past our vision depended too much on our natural concept, and our natural concept has been influenced by the traditional Christianity
