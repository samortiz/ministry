   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many times when you try to study the Bible, you are deadened because you get a lot of doctrinal knowledge without life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to study and read the Bible prayerfully with the exercise of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The mental reading kills, but the prayerful reading gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more you read the Bible prayerfully, the more you have the deep sense that something within you is flowing, quickening, reviving, enlightening, and strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Concordant Literal New Testament translation of 2 Corinthians 3:6 says that the Spirit is "vivifying."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more you read the Word prayerfully, the more you are vivified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When you read the Word mentally, you are mortified, but when you read the Word prayerfully, you are vivified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether you will be vivified or mortified depends upon the way you take to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even the Bible can be a dead, written code to us if we do not come to Christ Himself to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need more life, not more knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be more and more vivified.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can be vivified by pray-reading the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life is what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is not the Spirit of doctrine but the Spirit of reality, who is Christ Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we contact the Spirit, the more we are vivified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The life-giving Spirit, the vivifying Spirit, is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 6 of 2 Corinthians 3 says that the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Darby puts verses 7 through 16 in parentheses, indicating that verse 17 directly continues verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 17 says that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, the Spirit who gives life is Christ the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would like to point out what Dean Alford said concerning 2 Corinthians 3:16-17:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord of v. 16, is the Spirit...which giveth life, v. 6: meaning, "the Lord," as here spoken of, "Christ," "is the Spirit," is identical with the Holy Spirit...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us also read what M. R. Vincent had to say about this passage of Scripture:</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Christ of v. 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers v. 6 ...</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may wonder how Christ, as Dean Alford pointed out, could be the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may not be able to understand this, but we simply need to say amen to what the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hebrews 1:8 refers to Christ the Son as God, and then verse 9 says that God is His God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the mystery of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot fully comprehend such a mystery, but we can accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible says that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, that the Lord is the Spirit who gives life, and that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not my teaching, but my quotation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is not my invention, but my discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now that we have seen the anointing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, the pledging Spirit, the writing Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit, let us go on to see the remaining aspects of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians.</S>
