   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HUMANITY OF ONE WHO SERVES THE LORD BEING FOUND BY OTHERS TO BE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 3:9 says, "And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Chinese Union Version renders the first part of this verse, "And being in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is a big difference between being found in Him and being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be "in Him" does not involve the matter of humanity; it only expresses a fact and a hope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The proper translation is to "be found in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To "be found in Him" has to do with our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our humanity should be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ should be my form as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Others should see a form in me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This form is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ should be my humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Philippians 1 Paul said, "As always, even now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death" v. 20b . Paul did not care for life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He always magnified Christ in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This magnification is a form.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This form can be likened to the squares in the exercise book which we used for practicing Chinese penmanship when we were young.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The teacher would write the characters properly in the top squares first.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The students would then copy the words in the other squares.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There was a form there; one could not write randomly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today, we also have a square around us, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>BEING IN CHRIST AND MAGNIFYING CHRIST AS ALWAYS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The humanity that we are speaking of here is different from the humanity taught by the Chinese Confucianists.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We both speak concerning humanity, but the elements of the two speakings are different and the natures are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Confucianists' nature at best is but bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But our nature is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Take a pocket watch as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We may all have a pocket watch, but your watch is bronze or steel while mine is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They are all watches, but they are not the same kind of watch.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The difference is in their nature and element.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christian humanity does not refer to our natural virtues; rather, it is the Christ who lives in us and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Philippians, we are people in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From the day we were saved, we have been transferred from Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the parable of the sower in Matthew 13, the Lord sowed Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, 1 Corinthians 3 considers our salvation as a kind of planting v. 6 ; we have been planted into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, it is Christ growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our hearts are like the soil; they are for growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, it is of God that we are in Christ Jesus 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is God who has translated us from Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today our position is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we have to attain to a condition in which we are found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, whether by life or death, Christ should be magnified in our body as always.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the Christian humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>OUR OLD CREATION CAUSING PROBLEMS TO OUR HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Over the past sixty years, I have seen much that has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the first thirty years, I saw things happening to Brother Nee personally.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the second thirty years, I experienced them myself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We both realized that though some Christians did love the Lord and eventually, became co-workers and elders, after a period of time they changed, and their humanity became a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One could no longer see any love, forgiveness, or faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There was no humility and purity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, we saw lying.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is an undeniable fact.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>More than twenty years ago, a co-worker wrote a letter to me which was filled with good words and was totally positive.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But after three days, another letter was sent to me from Manila; it was a copy of a letter which this same brother had written.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The content of that letter was totally negative.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May the Lord's blood cover me in saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This matter has affected me very much and has rendered me great help.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In 1962 when I first arrived in the United States, the messages released during the first one or two years were all on transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Transformation is a kind of metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When you add one element to another, the substance will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before we were saved, we only had improvements.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Once we are saved, the heavenly chemical element, which is the Lord Jesus, is added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From that time on, we have another constituent in us, and we begin gradually to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are transformed from being in Christ to being found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is like what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12, that he was then only a man in Christ v. 2 . But in Philippians 3 he said that he would like to be found in Christ v. 9 . When we were saved, we had the Lord's mercy and grace to consecrate ourselves fully to the Lord and to love Him in a pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At that time, surely we were in Christ, living out Christ, and found by others to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But after many years, due to positions, private interests, and other situations, we became disturbed; as such, we could no longer live in Christ and were no longer magnifying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to see that it is only when the Lord returns and our bodies are redeemed that we can be totally free from the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Otherwise, a certain part of our being still remains in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the part of the old creation that gives problems to our humanity.</S>
