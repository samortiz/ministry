As God incarnated, He is the very embodiment of the Triune God (John 1:14a; Col. 2:9). The name of this Christ is Jesus&#151; Jehovah the Savior becoming Jehovah the salvation (Matt. 1:21). Jesus, Jehovah our Savior, has become the source of our eternal salvation through the process of His vicarious death for the accomplishment of the eternal redemption (Heb. 5:9; 9:12). In order for the Lord Jesus to go from the throne in the heavens to the cross on Mount Cavalry, He had to pass through many processes. He came from and with His divinity into humanity. He was born of a human virgin, and He passed through human living. He passed through all kinds of sufferings.</P><P>We should not think He was arrested and put on the cross unwillingly. He voluntarily gave Himself up on the cross. When He was arrested, He said, "Do you think that I cannot beseech My Father and He will provide Me at once more than twelve legions of angels? How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?" (Matt. 26:53-54). He volunteered to present Himself to the Father on the cross. This was for the accomplishment of our eternal redemption, which is the base of our eternal salvation. Salvation is based upon redemption. The Triune God can be our Savior because He passed through the necessary processes to accomplish redemption. Based upon His redemption, He as our Redeemer becomes our Savior and our salvation.</P><P>The source of salvation is the very fountain of the Triune God's salvation, out of which well up many springs (Isa. 12:3b). Thus, the processed Triune God has become our salvation (v. 2) with Christ, the life-giving pneuma, as the many springs from whom the believers draw the water of life (v. 3a; John 4:14; Rev. 21:6). The enjoyment of this salvation with the springs of the water of life becomes our strength and song (Isa. 12:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO DRAW WATER<br>FROM THE SPRINGS OF THE DIVINE SALVATION</H2><P>Now we want to consider the way to draw water from the springs of the divine salvation. First, we need to be those who are repenting to turn God's anger and receive God's consolation of forgiveness (Isa. 12:1). We also need to be those who are praising Jehovah, calling upon His name (v. 4a). Furthermore, in order to draw water from the springs of salvation, we should make God's saving deeds known among the peoples and exalt His name among them (v. 4b). We also need to sing to Him for He has done something majestic, and we must let this be made known in all the earth (v. 5).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_194.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_196.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Isaiah &nbsp; pg 195</div><br></body></html>
