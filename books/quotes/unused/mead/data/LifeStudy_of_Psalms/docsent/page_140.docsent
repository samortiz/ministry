   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS REALIZING THE VANITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF HIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may say that the title of Psalm 38 could be "Sin and Iniquity," and the title of Psalm 39 could be "Nothing and Vanity."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 39 reveals the psalmist's sentiment in his realizing the vanity of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This psalm shows us that we are nothing and vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Keeping His Ways</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>by Muzzling His Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verses 1-3 David said that he kept his ways by muzzling his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. Realizing the Nothingness and</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Vanity of His Life</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>David realized the nothingness and vanity of his life and asked God to remove His chastening for his transgressions from him and look away from him as a stranger and sojourner vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>4-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We always think that we are something and somebody, but David was brought by the Lord into a situation to realize that actually he was nothing and vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>David said that every man at his best is altogether vanity v. 5 . He said that his days were as handbreadths.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A handbreadth is very short, that is, only about four inches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David said that man goes about as a semblance, an empty show, and that people are bustling about in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They heap up riches, but they do not know who will come to gather them v. 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the end of Psalm 39, David asked Jehovah to hearken to his cry v. 12 . But I do not believe that God would answer him right away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God would keep David in his situation for a while so that David would be compelled to realize his real situation and his real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to realize that our condition is sinful, and our situation is one of vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Psalm 37 David had much to say.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seems that in this psalm he knew everything and could say everything.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in Psalm 38 he realized that his condition was sinful, and in Psalm 39 he realized that his situation was full of vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many of us are still remaining in Psalm 37.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In one meeting a brother prayed a long prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It seemed that in his prayer he knew everything, understood everything, and could say everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a long prayer, however, kills everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead, we should be those who pray, "O Lord, I don't know what to say, and I don't know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I even don't know what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My lifetime is as nothing before You.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, have mercy upon me."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>David eventually said that he was a stranger with God, a sojourner, just as all of his fathers were Psa 39:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A stranger is one who does not know anything about the place where he is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Testament, all the believers should be heavenly strangers and sojourners 1 Pet 1:1; 2:11 , sojourning as foreigners on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that we all have been replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all have been crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then it is a fact that it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to see the human concept in the Psalms so that we can jump out of this concept into the divine concept in Paul's Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible tells us that the word of the Lord is the truth, the reality John 17:17 , and also the light Psa 119:105 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Through the truth and light released in these messages, I hope that we can see what God wants us to be.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God wants us to be nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants us to be replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, what God wants was expressed by Paul when he said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ has crucified me, and Christ has come into me to replace me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now I have an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He lives and works, and I live and work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ replaces me to live Himself through me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the divine concept of God according to the divine revelation of the New Testament.</S>
