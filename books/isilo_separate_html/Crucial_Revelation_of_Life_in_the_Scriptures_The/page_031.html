Week by week as we come to the Lord&#8217;s table, we have a feast. In the past when I attended the so-called communion service, I was never told that the Lord&#8217;s supper was a table, a feast. I was taught to take the holy communion by first examining myself to see whether I was sinful or not. I would ask myself about my heart, my mind, my thinking. I would ask how I was with my parents, teachers, schoolmates, neighbors, or friends. I was then taught to remember the Lord by remembering how He was God, how He became a man, how He was born in a manger, and so forth. However, I was not told that at the Lord&#8217;s table I have to enjoy Him, that is, I have to eat Him and to drink Him. To examine yourself and to remember what the Lord did for us is certainly not wrong. However, the divine concept is that to remember the Lord is simply to eat and drink Him, to enjoy Him.<p>First Corinthians 11:24-25 says, &#8220;This is My body, which is for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me....This cup...drink it, unto the remembrance of Me.&#8221; The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup (v. 26), that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord, who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death. To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion, as our life and blessing. This is to remember Him in a genuine way. Thus, we remember the Lord not by thinking about Him, but by eating, drinking, and enjoying Him. The Lord&#8217;s table is a weekly proclamation, a declaration to the whole universe, that we daily enjoy Christ as our food and drink. He is our feast, our enjoyment.<h2 class=head2>The Marriage Dinner of the Lamb</h2><p>Eventually, when He comes, the overcoming believers will join Him to feast at the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7, 9). That unique, universal wedding feast will last one thousand years. This feast of one thousand years will be a wedding day to Christ because to the Lord one thousand years is as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). During those one thousand years, the church is the bride, and after the one thousand years, the church is the wife (Rev. 21:9-10). The difference between a bride and a wife is that the bride is only the bride on the wedding day. After the wedding day, the bride becomes the wife. On the wedding day, there is the bridegroom and the bride; on the following day there is the husband and the wife. The millennial kingdom of one thousand years will be a wedding day to Christ, in which the overcoming believers will be with Christ, enjoying His wedding feast.<h2 class=head2>An Eternal Feast</h2><p>The gospel is a feast that will last for eternity; therefore, the Lord&#8217;s table will never end. The Lord&#8217;s table today is a foretaste of the coming full taste in eternity. Eventually, that full taste will replace our present foretaste. On the table of this feast, we enjoy Christ Himself, who is for our eating and drinking. We are eating Christ (John 6:35, 57) and drinking the Spirit (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13), who is also Christ Himself (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17).<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
