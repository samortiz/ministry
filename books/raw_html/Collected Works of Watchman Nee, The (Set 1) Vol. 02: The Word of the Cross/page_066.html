<H1 CLASS=MSG>LESSON SIXTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JUSTIFICATION</H1><P>The meaning of justification is deeper than the meaning of forgiveness of sins. Forgiveness of sins means that even though we have sinned, God has forgiven our sins. Justification means that God not only forgives our sins, but also justifies us. Forgiveness of sins is like the general amnesty in ancient China, when all the criminals were pardoned. Justification is like a declaration of "not guilty" by the court and is more than just forgiveness. Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus is justified by God. We should not only believe that each one of us has been justified by God, but we should also always have the boldness of justification to stand before God. Sometimes we may be weak and we may stumble, fail, or sin, yet we are still justified by God; our justification will not change because of our sins. After justification, we cannot be more justified through good works or less justified through evil works. Since justification is not obtained through works, it will not be lost through works. No matter what our condition is, we have the right to believe that every day we are justified by God through the Lord Jesus' merit. God accepts those who believe in Christ, just as He accepts Christ.</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>Believers are justified by the Lord of the heavens and the earth:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"It is God who justifies" (Rom. 8:33)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Grace is the source of justification:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"By His grace" (Rom. 3:24)</li>		<li>"By grace you have been saved" (Eph. 2:8)</li>		<li>"Having been justified by His grace" (Titus 3:7)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Justification is based upon the obedience of Christ:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Through the obedience of the One" (Rom. 5:19)</li>		<li>"Becoming obedient even unto death" (Phil. 2:8)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The price of justification is the precious blood of Christ:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"In His blood" (Rom. 5:9)</li>		<li>"Through His blood" (Eph. 1:7)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Justification is gained by faith:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Out of faith" (Rom. 5:1)</li>		<li>"Through faith in Jesus Christ" (Gal. 2:16)</li>		<li>"Everyone who believes" (Acts 13:39)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The proof of justification is the resurrection of Christ:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Was raised for our justification" (Rom. 4:25)</li>		<li>"Having been raised from the dead" (Rom. 6:6-9)</li>		<li>"Raised us up together" (Eph. 2:6)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The result of justification is good works:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Faith without its works is useless" (James 2:20-26)</li>		<li>"Let your light shine before men" (Matt. 5:16)</li>		<li>"Zealous of good works" (Titus 2:14)</li>		<li>"Be careful to maintain respectable works" (Titus 3:8)</li>		<li>"For good works...that we would walk in them" (Eph. 2:10)</li>		</ol></li>	</ol>
