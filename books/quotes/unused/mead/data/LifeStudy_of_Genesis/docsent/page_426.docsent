   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>12 The Change of Jacob's Circumstances</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter thirty-one Jacob's circumstances suddenly changed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His cousins envied him v. 1 , and his uncle's countenance changed toward him v. 2 . This change was for Jacob's benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this chapter, Jacob was in the middle of the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God sovereignly prepares everything for our transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nothing in Genesis 31 was accidental; everything was pre-planned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to God's sovereignty, Laban had many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the past, I thought that it would have been better for Jacob if Laban had had no sons and the two daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But Laban had several sons.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Throughout the twenty years of Jacob's stay with Laban, Laban and his sons regarded Jacob as a profit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Laban admitted that Jacob's stay with him was a blessing 30:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But 31:1 says, that Jacob "heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Glory here means riches v. 16.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Jacob's record, God revealed in a dream how He took the cattle from Laban and gave them to Jacob 31:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout the years, Laban's sons saw their father's flocks decreasing and Jacob's continually increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At a certain point, being envious of Jacob, they could not tolerate it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was not an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, "Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before" v. 2 . During the past twenty years, Laban's countenance might have smiled upon Jacob because Jacob was a cause of his profit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But after Laban realized that Jacob was no longer a cause of his profit, his countenance changed toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When anyone sees that you are causing his profit to wane, his countenance will change toward you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do not believe that people are really good to you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone is selfish and lives for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After staying with Laban for fourteen years, Jacob told him that he was leaving 30:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, he might actually have had no heart to go.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was just his policy to gain something from Laban.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Laban saw clearly that God's blessing was with Jacob and he did not want him to go.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, they negotiated and agreed upon the terms according to which Jacob would remain with Laban for another period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after several more years had passed, Laban realized that all the increase was on Jacob's side, and thus he changed his countenance toward Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This also was pre-planned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because it was time for Jacob to go back, God arranged for his cousins to express their attitude and for Laban to change his countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Jacob must have been seriously exercised concerning whether he should stay or leave.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that juncture, God intervened and said to Jacob, "Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee" v. 3 . If Jacob had been a completely transformed person, he would have immediately praised the Lord and told the Lord that he was trusting Him for His clear guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But Jacob did not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, he called his two wives to his flock, not daring to talk with them in his uncle's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After he talked with them about the change of circumstances, they consented to leave their father vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>4-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These changes in Jacob's circumstances and environment were all prearranged by God.</S>
