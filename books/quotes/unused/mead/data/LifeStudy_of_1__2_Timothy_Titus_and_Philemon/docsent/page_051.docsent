   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND TIMOTHY MESSAGE THREE THE INOCULATOR Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 2:1-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that the subject of 2 Timothy is inoculation against the decline of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider five specific titles given to the inoculator in 2:1-15.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These titles are a teacher, a soldier, a contender an athlete , a husbandman, and a workman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we read these verses carefully, we shall see that Paul regarded Timothy and his other co-workers as those who should be teachers, soldiers, contenders, husbandmen, and workmen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. A TEACHER</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2:1 Paul says, "You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "therefore" refers to chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul's exhortation in 2:1 is in view of what has been mentioned in the preceding chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Based upon what he has just written to Timothy, Paul now goes on to encourage him to be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul did not charge Timothy here to be empowered in knowledge or in gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He charged him to be empowered in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostle himself had experienced the empowering of grace in life 1:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now he exhorts Timothy to be empowered in the same grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This grace is God's provision in life for us to live out His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Instead of being discouraged, Paul was empowered in grace, even though he was in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He realized that grace is nothing less than the processed Triune God the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Second Corinthians 13:14 indicates that grace is the very Triune God Himself: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>. Grace is not a thing; it is a unique Person, the living, divine Person of the Triune God processed to be the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Spirit now dwells in us as our grace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all can be empowered in this grace in the indwelling Triune God processed to be our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more we are empowered in this grace, the more able we shall be to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, in verse 2 Paul goes on to say, "And the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The things to which Paul refers here are the healthy words in 1:13.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The healthy words, after being committed to faithful men, become the good deposit in them 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word indicates that if someone in a local church has a deposit of the Lord's healthy words, he should train the faithful ones, the trustworthy ones, that they also may have a good deposit from the Lord, thus making them competent to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul realized that Timothy had received a good deposit, that he had been taught and nourished with the riches of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, he charged Timothy to commit these things to others who would be faithful and competent to carry on the same ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates that more than one person is needed to carry on the riches of God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My hope is that through all these Life-study Messages thousands of saints in the Lord's recovery will receive a good deposit of the riches of grace concerning God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then those who have received these riches will be able to commit these things to others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Imagine what the situation would be if the Lord had ten thousand saints filled with His good deposit, spreading the riches of His economy throughout the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No doubt, this would hasten the time of His glorious appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is one God, one Christ, one Spirit, and one church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because God is one, His way must also be one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is this way to be found in Catholicism or in the denominations or in the charismatic movement?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Neither is God's unique way found among the independent Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's way is in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, the recovery is the recovery of the unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many saints can testify with a pure conscience from the depths of their being that if they do not take the way of the recovery today, they have no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's recovery is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I say this, not because I have been used of the Lord in His recovery, but simply because it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some who became dissenting and left discovered that they had no way to go back to the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In certain cases the denominations might not even be willing to accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows that if we touch the recovery and then leave it, we commit spiritual suicide, for we turn away from God's unique way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 2:1 and 2 Paul is burdened to charge Timothy, one who had received such a good deposit, to pass on the riches of grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then there would be many teachers, many ministers of Christ, to spread the riches of God's New Testament economy.</S>
