<h2 class="head2">Led by the Grace of the Lord<br />(Xinchang)</h2><p>All of our service used to be under the system of the denominations. In December 1949, we attended an edification conference in Ninghai and began to see the Lord's light. We were led by the Lord's grace to begin the Lord's table meetings in Fangkou in March of this year. But we are still spiritually immature and do not know how to begin to go the Lord's way. Thank God for giving us the book on the edification of the new believers that we could understand some of the truth and know the importance of serving God. We really praise the Lord and thank you.</p><p>There is also a meeting in Dasiju, twenty miles from us. One of their brothers attended the edification conference in Ninghai. Like us, they began to have the Lord's table in March of last year.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Wu Fa-gang<br />January 16, 1951</p><h2 class="head1">PLEASE HELP US IN THIS WAY</h2><p>Those who send letters that only concern the periodicals should address them to The Periodical Subscription Department, The Gospel Book Room.
