   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"SHINETH MORE AND MORE UNTO THE PERFECT DAY"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His days on earth were coming to an end. During the time he lived in the land of Goshen, not much happened to him; he just lived a simple life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, he did not become rusty during those seventeen years; he was progressing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Day by day he shone brighter and brighter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Indeed he shone more and more unto the perfect day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His death marked the time of the zenith of his shining.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We pray that God would give us an ending similar to his.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis 47:28-30 says, "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: but I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And he said, I will do as thou hast said."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is interesting to note that while Jacob was in the land of Egypt, he never told his son what kind of dwelling or living he wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But now he said to his son, "I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not care about eating and clothing in the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was not bothered by these things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He accepted whatever his son gave him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, regarding his burial place after his death, he was very particular because this was related to God's promise, the land of God's promise, and the kingdom God would establish.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Previously, Jacob was a man who only cared for his own profit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, now he was not concerned about personal comfort, but about the covenant between God and His house, that is, the position which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob occupied in God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The former Jacob was a crafty person who upbraided his sons Simeon and Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The present Jacob mildly called his son Joseph to come.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Previously, when Joseph told Jacob about his dream of the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowing down to him, Jacob rebuked him and said to him, "Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gen 37:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now he called his son and gently, not disapprovingly, said, "If now I have found grace in thy sight..."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This man was indeed mature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He said, "Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He uttered the most important things with the most tender words.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He said, "But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These words show us that God had constituted a new character in Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The following words are very precious: "And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head" v. 31 . "Upon the bed's head" corresponds to "leaning on the top of his staff," which is quoted in the book of Hebrews 11:21 . We believe that since the time he became lame he carried a staff.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, the staff spoke of his lameness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, it indicated that he was a sojourner.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now he worshipped God while leaning on the top of his staff.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By this he was saying to God, "Everything that You have done with me is the best that could be.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, I worship You."</S>
