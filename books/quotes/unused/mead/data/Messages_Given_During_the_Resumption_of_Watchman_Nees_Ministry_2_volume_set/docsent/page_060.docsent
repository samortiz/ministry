   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Being Selective about Whom to Preach To</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once a person asked D. L. Moody if all saved ones were predestinated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Moody answered yes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That man then asked what would he do if a person who was not predestinated by God became saved through his preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moody answered, "Dear brother, it does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a person is saved, surely he was predestinated by God already.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All you have to do is to preach, and the predestinated ones will spontaneously be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person is fleshly, he will be fleshly whether or not he preaches the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If that is the case, it is better for him to preach than not to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he preaches, at least God can use such a one to bring some to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If among a thousand people who are saved, four hundred go back to their sins, still we have six hundred people left.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The other four hundred may fall into sin, but they are at least saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At any rate, if you do not save them, they would have been in their sins anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reason, we should not limit the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In preaching the gospel, there is no need to exercise discernment; you only need to preach blindly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The management of the church, the care of business affairs, and the receiving of believers all these require the proper discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in preaching the gospel, all we have to do is to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a person casts his net into the sea and the fish come, all he has to do is to draw the net.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A gospel preacher does not have to worry about too many things, and he cannot exercise too much discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Leave the discerning to the ones who are sorting the fish; the ones who are drawing the net do not need to exercise any discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only the ones sorting the fish need to have the concern; the ones drawing the net need not have any concern.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Testimony in Chefoo</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of the Church Preaching the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1941, our number in Chefoo doubled within half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every month some people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, not every one of them was good, but we can say that most of them were good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In April, we had only about a hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the end of the year, we had about six hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We printed two hundred thousand gospel tracts for the two hundred thousand people living in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On every street we put up large posters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The brothers' and sisters' homes were filled with more posters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some even rented wall spaces to put up posters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the evening, some went out with lanterns, others with accordions in their arms, to preach the gospel in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some would sing, while others would pass out gospel tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some even knelt by the sidewalk to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the last few days of the Chinese calendar year, the whole church would fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1943, within a few days twelve hundred people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the brothers and sisters offered up their possessions, houses, and even land deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From January 1, the whole church rose up to preach the gospel, and at least eighty percent of the saints were mobilized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>None of them would celebrate the New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some would pray, while others would go out to invite friends.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every year, we had at least a few hundred saved this way, and among them at least a hundred would be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After baptism we would distribute the names of the new ones to the brothers and sisters and ask them to go to visit these new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the visitations, the saints would come back and report to us about the new ones' conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every year we sowed the seed at the beginning of the year, after which we began to reap, and the reaping continued until the fall season.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Chinese celebrate their New Year by having fellowship with demons; during the New Year, they put out idols and worship them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we preached the gospel during the New Year, we had to fight a spiritual battle with the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The people in the world indulged themselves in eating and drinking during the New Year, but our brothers and sisters only took simple meals.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later, after the Communists took over Chefoo, our brothers and sisters were still bold to preach the gospel just as before.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The gospel preaching in Chefoo in 1943 experienced the greatest blessing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During that time, I only preached twenty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While everyone was singing the song "Vanity, vanity," the Holy Spirit was already working, and when the call was made for all the ones who wanted to believe to stand up, the whole congregation stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One lady in high-heeled shoes came to listen to the preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At random, I pointed my finger to her and said, "Your husband did not have much money, but you still wanted him to buy you this and that."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After that meeting, that lady asked a sister, "How come Mr. Lee knows so much about me? I was just the kind of person he was talking about." Later she believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Another time when we were preaching the gospel, again at random I pointed my finger to a young boy, and I said, "You have stolen a piece of chalk from the school, and you have taken it home to draw circles."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That boy happened to have stolen a piece of chalk from his school and was indeed using it to draw circles at home.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said in his heart, "What does it matter?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Immediately after that, I said on the platform, "You are still saying in your heart, What does it matter?'"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the boy heard it, right away he believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>During that period of time, every time I went up to the platform I was filled by the Lord, and people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once I was preaching the gospel in a place which was a hall with an adjoining small room.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>During the meeting, both the hall and the adjoining room were filled with people.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the strange thing was that every time I preached, some from the hall would be saved, but no one from the small room would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>During one meeting, I purposely directed my speaking to the small room, but still no one stood up there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I then said, "This room has demons in it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to pull these demons out."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Soon after that, a mother and her daughter came to the meeting and sat in the small room.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The daughter held back the mother and would not allow her to stand up to accept the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I then pointed my finger at them and said, "Today, there are demons here trying to stop people from believing in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The daughter became afraid and dared not stop her mother any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Later both the mother and the daughter were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more we preach the gospel, the more new ones will be added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once new ones are added to us, the old ones will come alive.</S>
