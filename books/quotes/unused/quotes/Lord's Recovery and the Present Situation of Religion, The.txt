It may seem that the secular world keeps man away from God and that the religious world helps man to come back to Him
The age mentioned in Galatians refers not to the ordinary, secular world but to the particular, religious world
Verse 15 begins with the word for, indicating that what follows is an explanation of what has just been mentioned
The present evil age in Paul's time included Judaism, the religion of the Jews, with its circumcision and the law
God gave us the Bible, but the enemy of God utilized man's mentality to form many religions based on the Bible
After visiting all these religious centers, we were impressed with the religion, tradition, superstition, and falsehood that we saw there
The Lord has no way to fulfill His eternal purpose in religion, including Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism
We had the deep sensation that the atmosphere in some of these places was full of demons, and we could not remain there for very long
The Catholic Church has received even the charismatic movement and infiltrated it with the worship of Mary and the mass
He told the audience that although our languages are different, we are all one in the Spirit and are members of the mystical Body of Christ
He also said that we must have a personal connection with Christ as the resurrected One and must care for the new man in our daily walk
His spiritual message amidst all those things related to idol worship was truly three measures of meal in which much leaven was hidden
Only because we had been rescued from such a situation were we able to appreciate the spiritual terms that were spoken
Because of this, the Jews now consider it to be a sacred site, and they come there to pray, weep, and even to kiss the wall
Circumcision and the law were evil because these two religious items kept people away from Christ and the Spirit
We have received the Spirit, God bountifully supplies to us the Spirit, and God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts
Since we have the Spirit, we must walk by the Spirit, live by the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit, and reap eternal life of the Spirit
Even when He came into His ministry, He did not stay in Jerusalem for long; He went there mainly for the annual feasts
The last time the Lord went to Jerusalem for six days, He stayed in Bethany, going into Jerusalem only during the day
Most of His life and work were in Galilee, and all the disciples whom He called, except for Judas, were from Galilee, not from Judea
When we were in Israel, however, we realized that the Lord needed to be in Galilee because the atmosphere in Jerusalem was too religious
The Lord Jesus gave up that region and went to Galilee of the Gentiles, where there was little influence of religion
God's New Testament economy could not be carried out by the people in Jerusalem, who had been fully drugged by religion
If the religion at His time was hopeless, religion today is even more hopeless, and the Lord cannot have His way in it
Today the Lord is coming to visit many campuses around the 'Sea of Galilee' to call many 'fishermen' to follow Him and be trained by Him
In this way, the Lord will gain both 'Galilee' and 'Jerusalem,' that is, the United States, Europe, and Israel
After He made His plan, God created the universe with the heavens, the earth, and especially man with a human spirit
He came in and utilized all the points in this Holy Book to instigate man to exercise his mentality to form religion
Religion is something formed by the human mentality under Satan's instigation and inspiration in order to oppose God's economy
In the Old Testament, God gave His people the commandments concerning circumcision, the Sabbath, and dietary regulations
These three things-circumcision, the Sabbath, and the holy diet-are the three pillars upon which Judaism is supported
He was persecuted and fled to Egypt and later because of the persecution in Judea around Jerusalem He escaped again to Nazareth in Galilee
According to their religion, tradition, and superstition, they went to Jerusalem, the place of religion, and not to Nazareth
In Jerusalem there was the strong center of religion according to the Old Testament, but in Galilee there was a living person
Rather, they learned the 'trade,' the skill, of how to live by Christ and with Christ in a corporate way so that He might gain His church
After the Lord's resurrection they had learned their trade, and they also had the Trainer, Christ, living within them as their life
At this point there were two temples in Jerusalem, a physical one and a spiritual one as God's house on the earth
Apparently, the Old Testament speaks of priests in the physical temple, not of apostles in the spiritual temple
At least one hundred twenty, plus three thousand more on the day of Pentecost, received the heavenly vision to be in the spiritual temple
There were not only Jews but also some Gentiles in the church there, and at first Peter ate with the Gentile believers
Peter had already received a special vision in Acts 10:9-16, in which he realized that God had included the Gentiles in His economy
We may believe that we are strong, but when we are tested by religion, we may be exposed and find that we are weak
Religion is hateful in the eyes of God because religion replaces Christ, damages the church, and frustrates God's economy
He brought the four men, who no doubt were believers, to the temple and the priest, paid their fee, and waited for the completion of the vow
When Paul was surrounded by James and the others, perhaps including Peter and John, it was difficult not to be convinced
The Lord has His economy, and even though Paul tolerated the influence of religion, the Lord would not allow him to continue
God was sovereign and did not allow Paul to become involved in the old religion that he had thoroughly condemned in Galatians
70, that the Lord sent the Roman army under Titus to destroy Jerusalem and the temple, leaving not one stone upon another
Without that destruction, Christianity would have taken Jerusalem as its center, and the church would have fallen into another religion
Because there was a thorough destruction of Jerusalem, it is difficult to trace the history of the apostles after that time
He destroyed the temple, the city, and even the church there, because the church was falling back into Judaism
We should not think that as long as a group of people has the Bible, serves God, and tries to be scriptural, they are right
In the first few chapters of Acts, for example, Peter did not care for religion, politics, knowledge, or skills
The hierarchy of pope, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and elders constitutes a change in the nature of the Body of Christ
The Body of Christ is an organism, not an organization, and elders are the only office in the church for the purpose of oversight
Some dear ones who have come to our meetings enjoy the life here, but they are frightened by the need to function
In contrast, Christianity is merely a religion, and the hierarchy in it kills the functions of the Body of Christ
The hierarchy kills the functions of the Body of Christ, and the different teachings divide the church and cut it into pieces
Revelation 17 tells us that at the end of this age the Lord will sovereignly use Antichrist to terminate religion
There is no possibility for the Lord to prepare His bride in Catholicism, the state churches, or the denominations
Roman Catholicism claims to be the church built on a certain kind of rock, but that church cannot stand against the gates of Hades
Since the Lord began His recovery in the United States in 1962, we have been laboring, suffering, and struggling
The Lord's strategy today is to gain the young people, train them, and send them to 'Jerusalem' to raise up the church
Because America and Europe are the two most crucial continents with respect to the world situation, the Lord desires to gain them
Some Christians attempt to justify their organizations by asking Are not the people in these organizations real Christians who worship God
At the time of the Lord Jesus, the Jews not only worshipped God but carried out their worship according to the Old Testament
The proper priesthood, the priestly service, and everything the Jews did in their worship was according to the law of Moses
In order to oppose God, Christ, and the church, the secular world needs the religious world, and the religious world needs the secular world
They told him, 'You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law'
In actuality, Satan, the subtle one, had used these thousands of believers to bring the church back into Judaism
When Brother Watchman Nee came to Chefoo, he held a prevailing conference, and a British missionary received much help from his speaking
We may ask in return, 'Are not those in the charismatic movement within the Catholic Church seekers of spirituality'?
We cannot say that as long as people worship God, hold to the Bible, seek after spiritual things, and love the Lord, what they do is right
It was the members of the Sanhedrin, the 'supreme court' of the Jewish people, which judged things according to the Bible
In John 16:2 the Lord told the disciples, 'An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God'
While Saul was on the way to Damascus with authority from the high priest to arrest the believers, the Lord Jesus came to him
In 1963 in Los Angeles the leading ones of four different groups proposed that they come together to practice the church life
Paul certainly knew the correct doctrines and Christian practices, but he did not tell people which were right and which were wrong
He told them simply to receive one another and be like-minded, not according to doctrines and practices but according to Christ
When Paul was Saul of Tarsus and persecuted the church, he was a strong, religious 'barking dog' eating religious 'dog food'
Not many among the four Christian groups that we spoke of earlier had seen an adequate vision concerning Christ nor did they know the church
It is not that when we sit quietly in a pew we are dead and in religion but when we shout and are excited we are living and not in religion
After the re-formation of Israel and the return of Jerusalem to the Jews, more Jews became zealous for their fathers' religion
The fact that they join Catholicism and accept the worship of Mary is proof that they are not purely for Christ and the church
One hundred years later, in the 1820s, the Lord recovered a fuller and clearer practice of the church life among the Brethren in England
Regardless of how good, right, and proper our doctrinal concepts are, to hold to them in a divisive way is religious
People justify the observance of Christmas by the historical fact that millions of Christians have accepted it
The Jews today are more zealous the Catholic Church is absorbing spiritual practices and many Protestants are seeking the things of the Lord
One hundred years later, in 1920, the Lord was forced to go to the heathen land of China, which was truly a 'Galilee of the Gentiles'
He told me, 'The Lord was forced to come to China because, as far as the practice of the church life is concerned, it is still virgin soil'
These messages, all of which Brother Nee gave in 1948 and afterward, are even stronger than his messages in The Normal Christian Church Life
After the publication of Further Talks on the Church Life, the source of the rumor was forced to admit that it was wrong
In addition, certain ones among us who were co-workers of Brother Nee, being afraid of men, have not been bold to speak his true ministry
What the Lord is doing today is to go to 'Galilee' to catch the young Galileans to have a new, pure, and clean start
The present need is to send the young people to the front, that is, to the campuses, to fight the battle with a strong burden
Because of this, the religious people said, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners'
The Lord said that the religious people would not only reject the ones sent by Him, but they would also say that they were demon possessed
Some have called us a cult, and they compare our calling on the name of the Lord Jesus to chanting to a Hindu deity
The evil reports concerning the apostle Paul came not mainly from the Gentiles but from the Jews, from the source of religion
In Acts 24 the leading person of that religion, the high priest, came with the elders and an orator to accuse Paul before the governor
Some who hear this may be stirred up to go purposely to religious places and interfere with what people are doing there
Some even utilize Brother Nee's writings related to the matter of life but not those related to the matter of the church
The entire situation of religion today is Babylonian, because it is filled with divisions, confusion, counterfeits, and mixtures
At the end of this age the Lord will sovereignly use Antichrist, the evil incarnation of Satan, to terminate all religions
At the same time Antichrist and the ten kings under him will hate Babylon the Great, that is, the Roman Catholic Church
Antichrist will terminate all religion in his kingdom around the Mediterranean Sea in those three and a half years
After the fall of these two Babylons, there will be loud praises in heaven , and amidst the praises will be the prepared bride
In religion people can be saved, love the Lord, and seek Him, but the Lord cannot truly build His church there
The Lord is building the church, the messages are going out, and people are reading them, whether or not they will turn to take this way
Antichrist will sign a contract with the Jews for seven years, but in the middle of the seven years, he will turn his back on them
During the tribulation those who are in the local churches will help all the Christians to be the late overcomers
They need to pray and fellowship with the churches in order to seek the Lords leading concerning which university campuses they should go to
When they first enter college from high school, they are not settled, and they do not know the direction they will pursue
The older saints can help the young ones if they make themselves young, tender, and approachable to the freshmen
The younger saints can take the lead to contact people, and the couples can open their homes to keep the ones who are contacted
We all need to live by this living, subjective One and walk in our spirit, which is regenerated and indwelt by the Spirit of God
When we speak of our spirit mingled with the divine Spirit, some say that we are teaching 'evolution into God'
The first fact is in John 3:6, which says, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
The second fact, which is even stronger, is in 1 Corinthians 6:17, which says, 'He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit'
While saying that our union with Christ is scriptural, some say that to be mingled with the Lord as one spirit is a heresy
If we were only in Christ but He were not in us, or vice versa, there would simply be an indwelling, not a mingling
In such a mingling the distinction between the two elements of fine flour and oil is preserved, and no third element is produced
The same is true regarding the mingling of divinity and humanity in the incarnated Christ and in His believers
Today we are no longer like the children of Israel in the Old Testament, who had God only among them, not mingled with them
Rather, the apostle Paul charges us to live and walk by the Spirit and to walk according to the mingled spirit
We all need to realize that the Triune God has been wrought into our being, and we have been joined to Him as one spirit
Similarly, Paul said at the end of Galatians, 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers'
Originally we all were a 'Jericho,' cursed and condemned , but our Elisha, Jesus Christ, has healed the waters within us
Regardless of the composition of the churches we must realize that we are not in an age of doctrine we are in the age of the mingled spirit
The young people are full of energy and should 'sell all' to go to the campuses, but the middle-aged saints do not need to go out
Rather, the middle-aged persons are useful in carrying out the governmental affairs at the various levels of country, state, and city
After the young people hear this, they should not feel less important and decide not to go out for the Lord's interests
The older some are, the more insight and experience they gain, and as a result, they do not trust the younger generation
We could have raised up a single church in Los Angeles, remained there for many years, and increased our number to become very large
After that time, however, the spreading stopped because certain middle-aged brothers kept everything in their hands
We must do things diligently day and night, yet we must also not exercise control over the things that are in our hands
The young people are not going out in a light way; they are going to the frontier, where they will confront the enemy
Even Babylon the Great is gilded with gold, precious stones, and pearls, which are the components of the New Jerusalem
No one will receive leaven, signifying evil things and evil doctrines , unless it has been hidden in 'three measures of meal'
In the type of the Old Testament, when the Tent of Meeting with the Ark set out, the armies of Israel surrounded it
A good coach will help his team adjust according to their mistakes as many times as possible until the team can win the game
We must all learn to pray and not make decisions too quickly concerning our going out for the Lord's present move
If something is the Lord's will and we desire to go along, He will eventually clear the way for us to go peacefully
We should not make anything legal for others claiming that whoever does not go out for the Lords move is not properly in the Lords recovery
We will see not a movement with arrangements and organization but the move of the Lord in the spirit and with life
