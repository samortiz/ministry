   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Therefore, the first thing is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Blessed are those who have two lives!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Blessed are those who have two natures!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people say with their mouth that they believe in the Lord Jesus; they may even attend church services.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if all they have is what they inherited from their parents, they are still sinners destined for perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If all that a man has and is and all that he has acquired and obtained are but things that he has from his birth, he is a hopeless and useless person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If one believes in the Lord and acquires the second, he is regenerated, saved, and has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christians should pay attention to the difference between the first and the second.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They should be able to differentiate between what they have inherited from their parents and what God has given to them through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Christians have very confused views; they cannot differentiate between the first and the second.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They do not know what is of the first and what is of the second.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christians think that if they are zealous, patient, and speak nice words, if they pray well, zealously distribute tracts, and save people, their life, living, nature, and work will be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please pay attention to what I am saying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am not speaking what I do not know; I am speaking what I know.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God does not care for our good work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God only cares about where our good work originates from.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Where does the work originate?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the source?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though you have done some good, where does the goodness come from?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not mean that God hates meekness; rather, we have to ask where the meekness comes from?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Does it come from our self or does it come from the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Where does our zeal come from?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Does it come from our self or does it come from the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the principle?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The principle is that in everything we must ask if it comes from the first or the second.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God always rejects the first and always approves the second.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, you have to see whether your zeal comes from the first or the second.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose I have a quick temper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I see others being patient, I may admire them very much and commend them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God is concerned about another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He would ask about the source of the strength for this patience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He would ask where the power behind this patience originated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we see goodness in the first, we say that it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God will only say that something is good if the goodness is from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only what God considers to be good is truly good.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we see a preacher with a loud voice, clear enunciation, zest for work, and zeal for saving souls, we often say that he is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God asks if these attributes are from the first or the second.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A brother once said that Christians today have no discernment at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When they see a preacher banging the podium with his fist, they say that he is very powerful!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But where does his power come from?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Any talent, strength, and natural attribute that comes from the first should not be trusted.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God only wants what is acquired after regeneration; He wants everything that comes from the second.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not only should a preacher reject what is from the first, but every believer should reject what is from the first.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Natural goodness and patience are like rubber bands; when the rubber is stretched to the limit of its elasticity, it is no longer flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They can never match God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If anything is from God, it can be stretched indefinitely.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A fleshly source cannot supply a spiritual need; this fact is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Adam cannot help Christ, and that which is of Adam cannot help that which is of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people think that as long as they love others, everything will be "all right."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But this "all right" is not enough; we still have to ask if this "all right" is given to you by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A brother once said that only what proceeds from heaven will go back to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I think the reason we often say that heaven is our home is because all we are and have comes from heaven; this is why going to heaven is returning home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If all that we have is of the earth, then heaven must be a guest house and not our home!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God can never receive what did not proceed from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is there a difference between the day we first believed and today?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Does being a Christian merely involve the removal of the sins, failures, weaknesses, filth, and other negative things that existed before we believed?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If this were so, then others will say that being a Christian is just removing all that is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But this is not good enough for God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God does not disapprove of only bad things; he also disapproves of many good things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God does not just remove all that is bad; He rejects everything that comes from the first.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God rejects not only the sin in the flesh; He also rejects the cleverness in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He not only rejects the filth of the flesh; He also rejects the goodness and righteousness of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is not pleased with anything that comes from the first the fleshly and natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Nothing of the first can mix with that which is new.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the four Gospels we see the Lord Jesus telling men that if they do not love Him more than their father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and their own life, they were not worthy to be called His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In another place the Lord said that if a man did not hate his own father, mother, wife, and children, he was not worthy to be His disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In Paul's Epistles he not only exhorts children to submit to their parents, but also for parents not to provoke their children.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In another place we see a word for the husband and wife: the husband should love the wife and the wife should love the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Gospels repeatedly say that we should hate, while the Epistles repeatedly say that we should love.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If you cannot differentiate between the first and the second, and if you cannot differentiate between the flesh and the Spirit, you will not understand the meaning behind these words.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you cannot differentiate between the first and the second, the natural and the supernatural, you will think that you can treat your relatives any way you want when you read that the Lord said that he who does not love Him more than his father, mother, and children is not worthy to be called His disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When Paul says that parents, children, and couples should love one another, you will think that you can forget about everything else except loving your relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord Jesus forbid natural love, while Paul commanded us to have spiritual love.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If your love is natural, you will drift from the Lord, your fellowship will lessen, your love will be diverted, and your intimacy will be lost because of the relatives that you love.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you are willing to put your parents, wife, and children into God's hand, and if you are willing to hate them if God wants this, you will immediately be aware of God's second commandment, which is to love your parents, wife, and children.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then you will be delivered from the first and enter the second.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many people receive only the first half in the Gospels, while many others receive only the second half in Paul's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Both of them are wrong.</S>
