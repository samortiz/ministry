   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Guiding Us with His Eyes</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Chronicles 16:9 says, The eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today God s eyes are running to and fro, seeking those whose heart is perfect towards Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 32:8 says, I will instruct you and teach you concerning the way you should go; / I will counsel you; my eye is upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord guides us not mainly with words or other indications but with His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The guiding of the eyes is the most intimate kind, and it is used between those who are intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When two very intimate people speak with one other, they may not necessarily use their mouth; instead, they may use their eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Very often when I visit the homes of brothers and sisters, I notice that the couples do not always converse with their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just with one glance, the other partner will know if it is time to brew the tea or take care of other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes I also understand what the glance means; when I look at their eyes, I know, for example, that it is time for me to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the husband and wife have been close to each other for a long time, perhaps for thirty or forty years, the husband has become the wife, and the wife has become the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because they have been mutually transfusing themselves into one another for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only this makes a sweet couple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same way, after we have been in the church for a long period of time, what God is, what the Lord is, is gradually infused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not something we can pick up intentionally; it is a result of a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He has been transfusing Himself into us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have at least four to five meetings a week, and in each meeting there are two hours of transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can compare this to charging a battery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a battery is fully charged, it can run for two days, but when its electricity is almost used up, it has to be brought back for recharging.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then after being recharged, it runs again.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have been charged for forty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the transfusion of the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is something that is too mysterious, beyond human description.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many brothers and sisters may be able to testify that before attending this conference, their understanding of the church was not thorough, but after hearing these messages they clearly see what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is the golden lampstand, and the seven lamps on the golden lampstand are the lamps of fire, which after burning us become the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The eyes are transfusing and sometimes rebuking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we enter into a meeting and do not have the sense of transfusion, we have to question whether it is really the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps it is the church, but it is not proper; it has problems because it does not give light or transfuse God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is as if the electric fuse has burned out, and the supply of electricity has been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When this is the case, the fuse should be quickly changed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Certain elders or young brothers know how to do this by releasing some prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the electricity is reconnected, and the whole meeting once again has the transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without the transfusion of God, we do not have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS SUPPLYING LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seven eyes that carry out the transfusion are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The seven lamps are the seven Spirits, the seven eyes are also the seven Spirits, and the seven Spirits are the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I was young, after I had been saved for a few years, whenever the Holy Spirit was mentioned, I felt puzzled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I dared not say that there was no Holy Spirit, but I did no know what and where the Holy Spirit was.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Gradually, I came to know that the Holy Spirit is the transfusion of God, and I know it more so today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After attending meetings for a long time, we may become accustomed to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When it is time to go to a meeting, we simply pick up our Bible bag and go.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, after sitting down for two minutes, a certain power or condition that is unexplainable begins to touch us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Originally we did not have a proper heart and were indifferent, but just by sitting in the meeting, we are touched within.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps in the meeting no one speaks either of the Holy Spirit or of the transfusion of God, but we are touched simply by sitting there.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes we are so thankful for this, and sometimes we are full of self-reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes we are enlightened, and sometimes we are rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes we are released, and sometimes we have peace and are watered.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the move and work of the Spirit; that is, it is the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more a meeting is full of the nature of the church, the more it is full of the operation of the Spirit, which is the seven Spirits transfusing and infusing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Spirit is life, and the seven Spirits are for us to receive the supply of life and to be equipped in life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The lamps have become the fire, the fire has become the eyes, and the eyes are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God first shines within us, then He burns in us, and then He transfuses and infuses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The issue is that we have the supply of life and are equipped with life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Eventually, our function is manifested in the church, and we grow in life and are built up together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result, we are not merely the church, but the functioning church in which all the saints minister.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are not only enlightened, burned, and infused, but we also receive the supply of life and are equipped in life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus we become the functioning members in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we turn to the Spirit, everything is life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The lamps are for illumining, the fire is for burning, the eyes are for transfusing, and the Spirit is altogether for the supply of life and the equipping in life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, there are the golden lampstand, Jehovah, the Lamb, the stone, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then there are the lamps, the fire, the eyes, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only when we have thoroughly understood these nine items do we know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church is a matter of these nine items.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we come into the church, we are first enlightened by the shining lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then there is the burning of the lamps of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then the eyes observe and care for us, transfusing what God is and what the Lord is into us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Last, there is the Spirit who is life with the supply of life and the equipping of life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All this in totality is the church.</S>
