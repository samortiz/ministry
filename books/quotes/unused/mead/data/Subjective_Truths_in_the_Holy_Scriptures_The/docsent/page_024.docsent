   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX SANCTIFICATION, TRANSFORMATION, AND CONFORMATION Scriptures reading: 1 Pet 1:2a; Rom 15:16; 6:19b, 22; 12:2a; 8:29; 2 Cor 3:17-18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our knowledge of the Scriptures is often veiled by our natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It seems we are not able to avoid our concepts when we come to read the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we do not have any understanding of the many profound truths in the Scriptures concerning subjective experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When reading the Bible, almost all Christians read only the letter; they read superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consequently, they do not gain any light or revelation concerning the real things in the hidden places.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THREE DIFFICULT TERMS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are three matters we may have noticed in the Scripture verses above.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning these matters, many know only the terms but do not have any idea as to what they mean.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What are these three things?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first thing is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is generally called "holy purity" in Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, in the original language of the Scriptures, this word does not have the notion of purity; instead, it is full of the meaning of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So, we see it is not purity; it is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be truly sanctified is not a matter of being made pure but a matter of being separated, being set apart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second thing is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most Chinese know the term for transformation, but they may not understand it in an accurate and proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This term denotes not merely a change but a chemical change, as in chemistry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The third thing is conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not hard to understand this term in the Chinese language, but it is not so easy to understand it with respect to the subjective, spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Due to our lack of subjective, spiritual experiences, we seem to know these terms when we read the Scriptures, but in reality we do not understand them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I started to read the Bible fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I came across terms such as sanctification, transformation, and conformation, my understanding was altogether according to my natural concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Concerning sanctification, or "holy and pure" in Chinese, I thought that as long as I did not commit any sin or do anything wrong, then I was holy and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I looked serious and remained quiet while others were joking and laughing, then I was holy and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning transformation, I did not understand its spiritual meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning conformation, because the Chinese Bible translated to be conformed into to imitate, I knew its literal meaning, but I knew nothing of its spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I lacked the subjective, spiritual experience, and I also did not have the guidance of those who were experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Fifty years ago when I was the same age as some of the young people here, I did not have the help you are receiving today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The experiences I gained in ten years could not be compared with the experiences you have now gained in half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because you have received guidance, it is easy for you to understand the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, even tonight I still do not have the confidence that many among us have a thorough experience of these three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is sanctification?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is transformation?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What is conformation?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I know that many of you have listened to messages and have read books on these subjects; yet I still would say that you probably have not had enough experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At this time we see that the leading of the Lord among us is for us to have a thorough view of these inward, subjective experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our burden is to help you, the younger generation, know the way of the Lord's recovery.</S>
