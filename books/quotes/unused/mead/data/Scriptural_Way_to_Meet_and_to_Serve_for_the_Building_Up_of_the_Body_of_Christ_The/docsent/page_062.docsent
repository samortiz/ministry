   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord s Person Being the Lord the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must tell the new ones that today the Lord is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18 , and that as such a Spirit He is our Redeemer, Savior, Lord, and Master.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A unique way to enjoy Him as all these aspects, to enjoy His presence, is to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We ourselves must be calling people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be people who call on the name of the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then when we visit the new believers in their home meetings, we will bring not only this practice into their homes but also an atmosphere, spirit, attitude, and impression into the new believers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They will be thoroughly impressed that the matter of calling on the name of the Lord is very unique.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No founder of any religion asked his followers to call upon his name.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is unique with Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only the Lord Jesus, the very God, Jehovah, asks us and even requires us to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Christian life begins with believing and calling Rom 10:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Calling is one of the initial experiences of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once we believe in the Lord in our heart, we also must call on Him with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the initiation of our Christian life; our Christian life starts from and with calling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today s Christianity does not stress this matter, but we should be different.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should have an attitude, spirit, atmosphere, and practice of calling on the Lord s name all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then, as such a person, we should help the new believers by stressing this matter of calling to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can never call too much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we lead one of the new believers into calling, he will enter into all the spiritual realities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the spiritual and divine realities are in the Lord s name and are wrapped up with our calling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our calling changes us and can make us happy and even beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This matter of calling on the Lord is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we have to build up a habit of calling at all times during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we call, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we would call upon the name of the Lord for half an hour, we would be beside ourselves with enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Regardless of how much we enjoy calling on the Lord s name, it is easy for us to neglect it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I charged the saints in Taipei to call on the Lord right after waking up and before getting out of bed in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But I have found that the more we stress this matter, the more we may forget it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we do not stress it, we may spontaneously practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should just practice calling without stressing or emphasizing it that much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we would go to bed at night saying, Lord Jesus, the next morning we may say, O Lord Jesus, spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we make up our mind to do something, we may forget to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we make up our mind to have a victory, we may experience defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we make up our mind not to lose our temper, Satan sends in one thing after another to urge, charge, induce, and stir us up to lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if we do not make up our mind to restrain our temper, we are able to restrain it in the Lord without hindrance from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here is a battlefield.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The wisest way to fight the battle is to intend to do something but not to make up our mind to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To make up our mind is to make our strategy known to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When two countries are fighting each other, they keep their strategies from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We too need to keep our spiritual strategy from the enemy by not speaking it out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Very often, if we speak out our spiritual strategy, in a short time we see the opposite thing occurring.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today there is the reality of spiritual warfare Eph 6:12 , and we are in a spiritual battle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason we sometimes have to keep things hidden within us, not speaking them out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We then keep things not only from men but more importantly from the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Calling on the name of the Lord is a battle because Satan hates the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit, who is the Person, the reality, and the realization of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we say, Lord Jesus, we are in the Spirit and we receive the Spirit 1 Cor 12:3; Acts 2:17, 21 .</S>
