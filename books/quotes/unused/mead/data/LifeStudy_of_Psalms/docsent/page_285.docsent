   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HIGHEST REVELATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although Psalm 110 is one of the shortest of the psalms, it is the highest revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. God Making Christ Sit at His Right Hand 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Jehovah declares to My Lord,/Sit at My right hand" v. 1a . This word, which concerns Christ in His ascension Heb 1:3b , has been quoted directly more than twenty times in the New Testament and has been quoted indirectly approximately another twenty times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Again and again the New Testament refers to this word concerning Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The highest place in the universe is the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us use as an illustration the desire of a child to be in his mother's arms, at her bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You may offer a child the best seat in a palace, but he will not care to be in that place if his mother is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The child might say, "I don't want to be in that place I want to be in the arms of my mother."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To the child, the best place, the highest place, is in his mother's arms, at her bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In like manner, Christ's ascension is not merely a matter of His being in a place but of His being in a person, the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His ascension Christ entered into the Father's being and sat down there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word about Christ's sitting at the right hand of God implies Christ's kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament we are told that in His ascension Christ has been made by God the Lord, the Christ, the Leader of the entire universe, and the Savior Acts 2:36; 5:31; 10:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This concerns Christ's kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Until God Makes His Enemies His Footstool</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to Psalm 110:1, Christ is sitting at God's right hand until God makes Christ's enemies His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At home you may have an excellent seat, but you may not have a footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Likewise, Christ is on the throne, but He is still in need of a footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, God is endeavoring to subdue all of Christ's enemies and to make them His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our fighting today is for the subduing of Christ's enemies.</S>
