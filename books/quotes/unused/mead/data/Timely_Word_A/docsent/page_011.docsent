   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Churches Being Local in Administration but Not Absolutely Independent</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is another important item from the Word that we have to realize.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The churches are surely local in their administration, but they are not absolutely independent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our history in the Lord's recovery, we were warned by the Brethren practice of autonomy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the states of the United States have their own administrations and governments, but they are not strictly independent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The states are separate to an extent, but this does not mean they are absolutely independent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the states were absolutely independent, the United States would not be one country.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It would become fifty countries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The local churches are not absolutely independent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the apostles kept their hands off of the affairs of the churches, this did not mean that each local church became one independent entity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nor did it mean that since the churches were under the teaching of the apostles, they became a federation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 1 Corinthians 4:17, Paul says, "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In all the churches, the apostle Paul taught the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His teaching was the same universally, not varying in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning this matter, we need to look at the seven epistles to the seven local churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches Rev 2:1, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the beginning of each epistle, it is the Lord speaking to a specific church 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 , but at the end of all the epistles, the Word says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What was said by the Lord to the church in Ephesus was the word that all the churches should hear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every epistle was a particular word to a certain church, yet this particular word should be heard and taken by all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, the elders of the churches have the right and the position to carry out the local administration of the churches independently.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, all the churches should listen to the word that the apostles have received of God, which is the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, the churches are local separately.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ which is an organism, not a federation which is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to meet as local churches separately according to what the New Testament says, but all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>By the way, I would add a little word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our fellowship many of us are used to saying, "Brother Lee says ."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I beg you, from now on, not to say, "Brother Lee says ."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead we should say, "First Timothy says "; or "First Corinthians says ."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in the United States, I have passed on the Lord's word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may have received the Lord's word through my speaking, through my teaching, but what I spoke was His word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all need to come back to the pure Word of God and discern accurately what His pure Word says.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Teaching of the Apostles Being the Real Leadership</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 1986 we had an elders' training on the one accord see Elders' Training Book 7 One Accord for the Lord's Move, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During that time I talked about the leading of the apostles and the leadership in the Lord's ministry, but I do not feel that what I said was accurately understood by some.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of this misunderstanding, I gave the last two messages in the summer training of 1987 on this matter see chapters eighteen and nineteen of The God-Ordained Way to Practice the New Testament Economy published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In those messages, I pointed out that the leadership in the New Testament ministry in actuality is not the leadership of one controlling person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, we have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Testament leadership is in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the four Gospels, the leadership was with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That was the leadership in a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord Jesus was the Leader who had the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus sent His disciples to certain places.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His disciples were to obey whatever He said.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Acts and the Epistles, Peter and Paul were supposed to be the leaders, but for the most part, they did not send anyone anywhere to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All of the going-out workers were sent by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts 13 tells us that Barnabas and Saul were "sent out by the Holy Spirit" v. 4 from Antioch to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, Paul did charge some of the younger brothers who were closely related to him, such as Timothy and Titus, to go to certain places and to do certain things 1 Cor 4:17; Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He charged both Timothy and Titus to come to him, and they received these orders 2 Tim 4:9; Titus 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But there is at least one case referred to in 1 Corinthians 16:12 that we must see: "Now concerning our brother Apollos, I urged him much that he would come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come whenever he has opportunity."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul was very burdened to help the Corinthians solve their problems, and their problems involved him and Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why Paul expected that Apollos would go to see the Corinthians personally.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul did not say that he charged Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said, "I urged him."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To urge someone to do something is much different from charging them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Paul said, "I urged him much and it was not at all his desire."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although Paul urged him, Apollos still had the liberty, the freedom, not to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And he did not do what Paul wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Apollos said that he would come whenever he had opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This may seem like a small verse, but it is very important to the truth concerning the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This verse is very strong to prove that Paul did not exercise any control over the work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul was not the leader in the New Testament move of God in the sense of commanding the co-workers to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Peter and Paul were not strict in this matter of the movement of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If they urged a worker to do something, and he felt not to do it, there was no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But all the apostles were very strict in the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4, Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently from God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The apostles would not tolerate any teaching that was different from God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The aged Apostle John, in his second Epistle, told the saints not to receive anyone who brings a teaching other than the teaching of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He said that these ones went beyond the teaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that they went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, which is the basic teaching of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>John was strict to the extent that he even charged the saints not to greet such ones.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the matter of the teaching of the apostles, the apostles were very strict.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This proves that the teaching of the apostles actually is the real leadership in the New Testament.</S>
