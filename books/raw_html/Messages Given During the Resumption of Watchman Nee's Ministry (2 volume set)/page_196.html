<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>a. The Cross Terminating Man and<br>Bringing In God</H2><P>A brother has a peculiar wife. This wife is the most peculiar person in Shanghai. Every day, this brother suffered because of his wife's peculiarity. One day he came and asked the responsible brothers about what he should do. The responsible brothers told him that this was the cross arranged by the Lord. Then there were mothers who could not handle their children. The responsible brothers also told them that this is the cross. The bad husband is a cross. The disobedient children are a cross. This is the cross, and that is the cross. It seems as if these kinds of crosses are everywhere.</P><P>Those who say such words do not have any light. If a brother is involved in a car accident and is sent to the hospital, or if he suffers in his business or encounters hardship from his wife, many people would say that this is the Lord's cross for him. They think that all these things are the cross. But what really is the cross? The cross means only one thing: "Not as I will, but as You will" (Matt. 26:39). The cross is the removal of human ideas, views, and opinions. The cross removes the human flesh and replaces it with God's will and His ways. The cross is the Lord's death terminating us and removing the human opinions and elements in us. The removal is the negative aspect of the cross. On the positive side, the cross brings in everything that God is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>b. Bearing the Cross Being to Allow Death<br>to Work Continually in Us</H2><P>The cross means death. This death works continually in us, putting aside our ideas, views, and opinions. All those who allow this death to work continually in them are bearing the cross.</P><P>Sisters, when you put on your dress, when you choose the fabrics and the styles, is there any element of your own will there? If there is, you are setting aside the cross, and the effectiveness of the death of the cross will not work in you. You are not submitting to God's will, because you have not taken up your cross.</P><P>The problem with the brothers is mostly money. In your prayer, you may say, "Lord, not according to my will." But after your prayer, you dare not ask what God's decision is. If your future plans run contrary to the Lord's will, you will not want to obey. Although in your prayer you say that you do not want your own will, yet in practice you are doing everything according to your own concepts and opinions. If we are dealt with by the cross, and if we allow the cross to break a hole through our proposals, decisions, and opinions all the time, we are bearing the cross. A person who is bearing the cross is one who will not come down from the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>c. The Cross Bearing Us<br>instead of Us Bearing the Cross</H2><P>With Christ, He first bore the cross and then was crucified on the cross. With us, we are first crucified on the cross, and then we bear the cross. When you take up the cross willingly, you will find that you are not bearing the cross; rather, the cross is bearing you. You will be relaxed, restful, and free. May the Lord teach us to learn the lesson of bearing the cross.</P>
