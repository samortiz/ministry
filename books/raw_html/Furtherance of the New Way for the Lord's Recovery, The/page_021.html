<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>HOW TO CARE FOR NEW ONES THROUGH THE HOME MEETINGS</h1><p>According to the statistics, there are 500,000 households in all of Taipei. In this past year we have knocked on the doors of 150,000 households, and the number of people baptized through door-knocking is more than 5,700. We rejoice because the more we go out door-knocking, the more effective we are. For example, in the most recent time of door-knocking there were 321 people who went out, and the result was that 157 were saved and baptized.<h2 class=head1>THE HOMES AS PILLARS SUPPORTING THE CHURCH</h2><p>Going out to knock on doors to bring people to salvation, establishing home meetings in the homes of the new ones, and teaching them to read the Bible and pray are just the initial steps. In the same way, a baby still needs a lot of nourishment and care after its birth. We all know that if a child is to grow up to maturity, after it is born, it needs to be nourished and taught. It is easy to give birth, but it is not so easy to nourish, and it is even more difficult to teach. Therefore, we must look at these things point by point to see how to carry out the proper nourishing and teaching. We will begin with the homes as a starting point.<p>We need to come back to the Scriptures to see the matter of meeting in the homes. For more than fifty years I have been studying the practices recorded in the Bible concerning the way for Christians to meet. The Bible does not have a clear word concerning this point; it shows us only a few patterns. Concerning the meetings, Hebrews 10:25 says that we should not abandon our own assembling together, and 1 Corinthians 14:26 tells us what things we should do when the whole church comes together, but it does not explain how to do them. These two passages are both words of teaching. The patterns given to us in the Bible are mainly in the book of Acts. Acts tells us that the early church met in the homes, from house to house (2:46; 5:42; 12:12).<p>Thus, according to this small but penetrating light in the Bible, the earliest church life was entirely carried out in the homes. It was altogether not like the situation today. Today there are a great many church buildings everywhere but few proper, living home meetings. I dare not say that they are absolutely nonexistent, but I can say that there is nothing concrete. In the age of the apostles, as soon as the church was formed, several thousand people were immediately brought to salvation. One time there were three thousand, and another time there were five thousand (2:41; 4:4). Then they simply met from house to house. When they met, they did mainly four things: preach the gospel, teach the truth, pray, and break bread. This is the light of revelation in the Bible, the clear leading of the Holy Spirit, and even more, the proper practice ordained by God.<p>Due to the degradation of the church, this kind of condition was gradually lost. As a result, organized Christianity was formed. Once there was organization, the result was the establishing of large corporate meetings, followed by the need for preachers. After the organization, the officers, and the preachers were brought forth, the clergy was produced. Once there was the clergy, the believers were divided into classes. Those belonging to the clergy were the speakers, while those belonging to the non-clergy were the listeners. Thus, Christian service and functioning in the meetings were completely taken over by a small number of people. Even today this kind of situation still exists everywhere, especially in Catholicism. Most Catholics know only to go to mass, but they are not able to perform any function as members. The situation in Protestantism is also like this.
