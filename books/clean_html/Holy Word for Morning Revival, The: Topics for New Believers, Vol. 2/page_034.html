<p><strong>WEEK 12 &mdash; DAY 5</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>1 Tim. 3:15 ...The house of God, which is the church of the living God...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eph. 2:19 ...You are fellow citizens with the saints...</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:22-23 ...The church, which is His Body...</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Assembly</h2>
<p>[In the New Testament, the word] <em>church</em> (Matt. 16:18; 18:17) in Greek is <em>ekklesia,</em> composed of two words: <em>ek,</em> out, and <em>kaleo,</em> called; the two words put together mean the called out congregation, or the assembly of the called ones. Hence, according to the literal sense of the word, the church is the assembly of those called out of the world by God.<sup>208</sup> There must be a great and thorough separation between the church as the <em>ekklesia</em> and the world as the system, the cosmos, of Satan. As the assembly, the church is separated entirely for God so that He may have a means to carry out His eternal purpose.<sup>209</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The House of God</h2>
<p> In the Old Testament both the tabernacle and the holy temple were called the house of God (Judg. 18:31; 1 Kings 6:1), which was a type of the church. The word <em>house</em> both in the original language and in the English language has two meanings: on one hand, it refers to the household, and on the other hand, it refers to the dwelling place....[As the household of God] the church is the composition of the believers...who are born of God, having God&rsquo;s life and nature. Hence, they become members of the household of God (Eph. 2:19), the family of God....[As] the house of God, [the church is also] the dwelling place of God on earth, the place in which God can have His rest and put His trust. Hence, the church is the dwelling place of God in spirit (v. 22). In this dwelling place God lives and moves to accomplish His will and satisfy His heart&rsquo;s desire.<sup>210</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:19 affords us the basis for saying that the church today is God&rsquo;s kingdom.<sup>211</sup> <em>Fellow citizens with the saints</em> [in this verse] indicates the kingdom of God. All the believers, Jewish and Gentile, are citizens in God&rsquo;s kingdom. God&rsquo;s kingdom is a sphere in which He exercises His authority....God&rsquo;s house is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers are born of God into His house to enjoy His riches. God&rsquo;s kingdom is a matter of right and responsibility; all believers born into the house of God have the civil rights of and obligations in the kingdom of God.<sup>212</sup></p>
<p>When a person is regenerated and born into the house of God, he enters into the kingdom of God (John 3:5). When he lives a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit in the church, he is in the reality of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). When he labors and works for the church according to God&rsquo;s intention, he labors and works for the kingdom of God (Col. 4:11). Thus, the church is the kingdom of God.<sup>213</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">The Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The Bible shows us that Christ with the church is one great person. Christ is the Head, and the church is the Body [Eph. 1:22-23].<sup>214</sup></p>
<p>God planned the church for the purpose of expressing Christ....The only way for the church to be the expression of Christ is for the church to be the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals clearly that the Body is one with the Head, Christ. If we do not have the Head, we cannot have the Body. We must honor Christ&rsquo;s headship and apply it to the practicality of today&rsquo;s church life.</p>
<p>The church as the Body implies life and function. The Body is a living organism. If it did not have life, it could no longer be the Body.<sup>215</sup> Every part of the Body must have the life of Christ and an organic relationship with Christ.<sup>216</sup> It also must have function, the function of all the members. If we are sincere in saying that we are the church, then we must all function as members of the Body. Therefore, the Body of Christ has the three crucial matters of the Head, the life, and the function.<sup>217</sup></p>
