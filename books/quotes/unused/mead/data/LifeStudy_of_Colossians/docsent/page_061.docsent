   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. With Persuasive Speech</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 4 Paul specifically refers to persuasive speech.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Usually those who deceive others are eloquent and persuasive in speech.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beware of eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A speaker may be very eloquent, but there may be no reality in his speech.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of being taken in by a speaker s eloquence, we should ask if there is reality in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sister M. E. Barber helped Brother Nee to learn this important lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he was young, Brother Nee was attracted by the eloquence and knowledge of certain visiting preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever Brother Nee expressed his admiration for a speaker s eloquence, Sister Barber would point out that although that preacher was eloquent and knowledgeable, there was no life ministered in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On one occasion in particular, Brother Nee thought that a certain preacher s message was marvelous, and he was confident that Sister Barber would agree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, Sister Barber still pointed out that the message was void of life and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From that time onward, Brother Nee no longer appreciated the empty speech of eloquent preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May we also learn not to be deluded by persuasive speech.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we see the vision of the all-inclusive Christ presented in the book of Colossians, we shall not be deluded by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No matter how excellent or how scriptural a thing; may be, it will not be able to lead us away from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is crucial that we have such a view of Christ in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The situation of the church at Colosse was very different from that of the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Corinth, the standard was low, there were divisions, and some saints were involved in lawsuits, some even in fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But at Colosse the standard of behavior was much higher.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As we have pointed out, the problem at Colosse was that the church had been invaded by culture, especially by Gnosticism and the Judaistic observances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These things were very refined, and for this very reason they were deceitful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we in the Lord s recovery today must be cautious of those who appear to be highly cultured and well-educated and who speak in a gentle and humble manner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who are the most deceitful usually seem to be very nice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No doubt, when the serpent approached Eve in the garden, he spoke in a very refined way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Be on the alert lest you are deluded through the persuasive speech of cultured people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only when we have a clear view of the place of the all-inclusive Christ in God s economy shall we be able to see through delusion and deception.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NOT TO BE CARRIED OFF AS CAPTIVE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In verse 8 Paul goes on to say, Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first step, seen in verse 4, is to be deluded; the second step, seen in verse 8, is to be carried off as spoil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The word spoil here does not mean to damage; it means to be a prey or a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who are carried off as spoil are carried off into captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A. Through Philosophy and Empty Deceit</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to beware that no one carries us off as spoil through his philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Greek the word rendered his is the emphatic article.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, it denotes a particular philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The philosophy through which the believers at Colosse were carried off as spoil was Gnosticism, a mixture of Jewish, oriental, and Greek philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As Paul indicates, Gnosticism is empty deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, every form of deceit is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nothing that is real, that has real content, can be a deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>B. According to the Tradition of Men</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The philosophy and empty deceit in this verse is according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The source of the Gnostic teaching at Colosse was the tradition of men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It did not depend on the revealed writings of God, but on the traditional practices of men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many cultural traditions are good.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, no one would care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to have a keen discernment to be kept from being deceived by the traditions in Catholicism and the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One principle we should follow is that of testing everything with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should care only for God s direct revelation in the holy Word, not for anything that is according to the tradition of men.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need not accept anything inherited from men as a tradition if it does not correspond to the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today s Roman Catholics are bound by their traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead of referring to what the Bible says or to what God says, they often stand on what the church says or on what is taught by the priests and nuns.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>On some occasions I have pointed out to certain Catholics the error of worshipping Mary and have shown them that this is not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nevertheless, they said that the worship of Mary is according to the teaching of the Catholic church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Other Catholic traditions are related to placing candles before images and praying to the saints to shorten the time that a relative must spend in purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although practices of this kind are not according to the Bible, Catholics follow them because of tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The traditions of men are also found in the denominations and in the independent Christian groups, where many believers care more for the tradition of men than for the Word of God.</S>
