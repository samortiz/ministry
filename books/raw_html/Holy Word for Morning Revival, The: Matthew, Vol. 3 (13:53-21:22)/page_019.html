<p class="bold">WEEK 13 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 17:14-18, 22-23</h2><p class="bold">14 &nbsp;And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying, </p><p class="bold">15 &nbsp;Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.</p> <p>16 &nbsp;And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.</p> <p class="bold">17 &nbsp;And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me. </p><p class="bold">18 &nbsp;And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour.</p><p>22 And…Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,</p> <p>23 And they will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised. And they were greatly grieved.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Immediately after the record of the Lord’s transfiguration on the mountain, we have the record of the healing of a demon possessed person (17:14-21). Following this, the Lord spoke to His disciples the second time about His crucifixion and resurrection (17:22-23). Then we have the incident regarding paying the temple tax (17:24-27). As we read chapter seventeen, it may be difficult to understand the connection between all these things. If we would understand the Gospel of Matthew, we need to remember that Matthew puts different facts together to reveal a doctrine.</p><p>We have pointed out that the coming of the kingdom in 16:28—17:2 was not the coming of the kingdom in full; it was simply a miniature and a foretaste. The prophecies concerning the manifestation of the kingdom have not yet been completely fulfilled. When we get out of the sphere of the transfiguration, out of the atmosphere of the manifestation of the kingdom, we face the power of darkness outside the kingdom. Demon possession signifies the power of darkness. In the realm of the Lord’s transfiguration there is glory, but outside this realm there is the power of darkness. While we are enjoying the transfiguration on the mountaintop, others are in the valley suffering from demon possession. During an inspiring conference or training, we may have the sense that we are on the Mount of Transfiguration. However, when we return home, we realize that the power of darkness is still all around us. To deal with the power of darkness there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King (17:18). We can exercise this authority only through prayer and fasting [v. 21]. As the heavenly King, the Lord has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord’s authority.</p><p>[In verses 22 and 23 we have the second unveiling of the crucifixion and resurrection.] The transfiguration on the mountaintop was not the full transfiguration. Christ still had to pass through crucifixion and enter into resurrection. Matthew specifically says that the disciples “were greatly grieved.” According to the concept of Peter, James, and John, the Christ who had been transfigured on the mountaintop did not need to be crucified. Thus, they might have said, “Christ has already been transfigured. Why does He still need to pass through crucifixion and resurrection?” Because the disciples had a mistaken concept, they were grieved at the Lord’s word.</p><p>We also may have times when we have a foretaste of the transfiguration. Afterward, however, we still need to descend from the mountain and bear the cross in the presence of our husband or wife. No matter how excellent the experience of transfiguration might be, we still need to stay under the killing of the cross. By bearing the cross we pass through crucifixion into resurrection. This is the connection between these three sections of Matthew.
