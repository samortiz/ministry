   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We are God's many sons, which will ultimately result in God bringing us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Redemption did not change God's purpose; on the contrary, it fulfilled the purpose that was not accomplished in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's original purpose was that man should rule, especially over the earth, but man regrettably failed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Yet all things did not come to an end because of the first man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What God did not obtain from the first man, Adam, He will obtain from the second man, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There was the eventful birth in Bethlehem because God ordained man to rule and restore the earth and because God determined that the creature man should destroy the creature Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why the Lord Jesus came to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He did it purposely, and He became a true man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first man did not accomplish God's purpose; rather, he sinned and fell.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He not only failed to restore the earth, but he was captured by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He not only failed to rule, but he was brought into subjection to Satan's power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Genesis 2 says that man was made of dust, and Genesis 3 points out that dust was the food of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that fallen man became the food of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man could no longer deal with Satan; he was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What could be done?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Did this mean that God could never achieve His eternal purpose, that He could no longer obtain what He was after?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Did it mean that God could never restore the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He sent His Son to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus is truly God, but He is also truly man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the whole world there is at least one man who chooses God, a person who can say, "The ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing" John 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, in the Lord Jesus there is not a trace of the prince of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must note carefully that the Lord Jesus came to this world not to be God but to be man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God required a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If God Himself dealt with Satan, it would be very easy; Satan would fall in a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God would not do it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He wanted man to deal with Satan; He intended that the creature would deal with the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord Jesus became a man, He suffered temptation as a man and passed through all the experiences of man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This man conquered; this man was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He ascended to heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jesus has been "crowned with glory and honor" Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not come to receive glory as God, but to obtain glory as man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not mean that He did not have the glory of God, but Hebrews 2 does not refer to the glory which He possessed as God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It refers to Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels because of the suffering of death; Jesus was crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our Lord ascended as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today He is in the heavens as man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man is at God's right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the future there will be many men who will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today a man is sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One day there will be many men sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Lord Jesus was resurrected, He imparted His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we believe in Him, we receive His life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all become God's sons, and as such, we all belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we have this life within us, as men we can be entrusted by God to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, it says that He will bring many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To rule is to be glorified, and to be glorified is to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the many sons have obtained authority and restored the earth, then they will be brought triumphantly into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should never presume that God's purpose is merely to save us from hell that we may enjoy the blessings of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must remember that God intends for man to follow His Son in the exercise of His authority on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God wants to accomplish something, but He will not do it Himself; He wants us to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we have done it, then God will have attained His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God desires to obtain a group of men who will do His work here on this earth, that God may rule on earth through man.</S>
