   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DAVID SPARING MEPHIBOSHETH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2 SAMUEL 21:7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Samuel 21:7 says, "But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the Lord's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was a famine in the days of David for three consecutive years because of Saul and his bloody house slaying the Gibeonites.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the Gibeonites' request, in order to make the atonement, seven of Saul's descendants had to be delivered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This should have been the end of Mephibosheth because the first one who should have been delivered was Mephibosheth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But David cared for him and took seven men from the other tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, Mephibosheth was spared until the end of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This story tells us that every saved person will not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>David took care of Mephibosheth from the beginning to the end. Will God wrong us? If David could protect Mephibosheth from beginning to end, will God not keep us to the end?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 10:28-29 says, "And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father's hand."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two verses are very familiar to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They show us clearly that we cannot be snatched out by anyone because of "My hand... and My Father's hand."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus' hand and the heavenly Father's hand have held us securely.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Who can snatch us out of such hands?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one can.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Someone might think, "It is right that none can snatch us out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we can escape."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a Christian talks in this way, he does not know the gospel at all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a father walks with his child's hand in his hand, what will he do when he sees danger or when he sees that the little hand is trying to escape?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Will he let the hand go, or will he hold it tighter?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was a black lady in the United States who, after she was saved, sang happily, "Once saved, forever saved."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A half-believing Christian asked her, "This is what you sing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But can you guarantee that you will go to heaven?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She then recited John 10:28-29 to him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He said, "That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But you had better not be so sure.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You should know that the bigger the hand, the larger the hole through which you can fall."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She answered, "No, I will never be leaked out because I am God's little finger!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She knew the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She spoke the truth, because the Lord is the Head, and we are His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are joined to Him in life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a Christian perishes, the Body of Christ will have a defect forever and will never be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May every Christian say to the Lord, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since I have been saved, I will be saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, I will give my all to You."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>ANNOUNCEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All issues of this magazine prior to Issue No. 28 have been entirely distributed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot send any more of them to those who have requested them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, from Issue No. 28 onward, six thousand five hundred copies will be printed for each issue.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The cost of printing and mailing has almost doubled from last year.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But thank the Lord, through the little offerings of many believers, there is no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since the end of July this year, there have been several hundred thousand gospel tracts issued every month.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The printing cost each month is not a small figure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But thank the Lord, there has not once been a time when there was a dire need that He has not supplied!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because of the burden to minister, study the Word, and write, and because his body is weak and frequently ill, Mr. Watchman Nee cannot answer every letter from so many places.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We hope the brothers and sisters in the Lord understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>December 18, 1932</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Shanghai</S>
