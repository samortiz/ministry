   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A CONSECRATED PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us look at Exodus 28:1-2 and 29:1, 4, 9-10.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After reading these verses, we can see that consecration is a very special matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The nation of Israel was a nation chosen by God Exo 19:5-6 , but it did not become a consecrated nation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were twelve tribes among the Israelites, but not all the twelve tribes received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tribe of Levi was one of the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were a tribe chosen by God Num 3:11-13 , but they were not a consecrated tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among the many Levites, only the household of Aaron received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not all of the Israelites received the holy service, not even all of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only the household of Aaron received the holy service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to be consecrated, one had to belong to this household.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If one were not a member of this household, he could not consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only the members of this household the household of Aaron were qualified to be priests, and only they could consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thank God, today we are the members of this household.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who believe in the Lord are the members of this household.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All who have been saved by grace are priests Rev 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has chosen us to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Initially, only the members of Aaron's household could consecrate themselves; if anyone else came near, he would have been put to death Num 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must remember that only those chosen by God to be priests can consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, only the members of this household could consecrate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today God has chosen us to be the priests; therefore, we are the members of this household.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, we are qualified to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we see that man does not consecrate himself because he has chosen God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, God is the One who chooses and calls, and then man consecrates himself to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who consider that they are doing God a favor by forsaking all are but outsiders; they are not consecrated at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must realize that our service to God is not a favor or courtesy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of offering ourselves to God's work, but a matter of God being gracious to us and giving us a portion of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is God who has given us the glory and the beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible tells us that the holy garment of the priest is for glory and beauty Exo 28:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consecration is God giving us glory and beauty; it is God calling us into His service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we boast in anything at all, we must boast in our marvelous Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is nothing marvelous for the Lord to have servants like us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The marvelous thing is for us to have such a Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must see that consecration is the result of being chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Serving God is an honor to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not uplifting God, as if we were sacrificing anything for Him or as if we had any glory in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consecration is God giving us the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should prostrate ourselves before Him and say, "Thank You that I can have a part in Your service.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are so many people in this world, yet I am chosen to have a part in it!"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Consecration is our honor, not our sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is true that we need to have the greatest sacrifice, but there is no sense of sacrifice in consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is only the full sense of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE WAY OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Leviticus 8:14-28 speaks of a bull, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The bull was for the sin offering; the first ram was for the burnt offering; and the second ram and the basket of unleavened bread were for the consecration offering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A. The Sin Offering</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to receive the holy service before God, that is, in order to consecrate oneself to God, the first thing that has to be taken care of is the propitiation for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only a saved person, one who belongs to the Lord, can consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sin offering is the basis of consecration.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The other was for the offering of consecration; it enabled Aaron to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What is a burnt offering?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A burnt offering is an offering which is burned completely.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The priest could not eat the flesh of the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the flesh of the burnt offering was burned completely.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The problem of our sin is settled by the sin offering, but the burnt offering makes us acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord Jesus bore our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This refers to His work as the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the same time, while the Lord Jesus was on the cross, the veil was rent from top to bottom, bringing us into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is His work as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The sin offering and the burnt offering start at the same place, but they arrive at different destinations.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They start where the sinner is.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The sin offering stops at the propitiation of sin, but the burnt offering brings the sinner further by making him acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The burnt offering is the offering which makes a sinner acceptable in the Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It goes further than the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The burnt offering is the sweet savor of the Lord Jesus before God that secures God's acceptance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today when we offer Him to God, we are accepted by God as well.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not only forgiven through the sin offering but also accepted through the Lord Jesus.</S>
