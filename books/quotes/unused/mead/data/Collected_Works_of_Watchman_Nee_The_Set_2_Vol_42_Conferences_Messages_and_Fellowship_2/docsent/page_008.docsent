   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO THE NEW TESTAMENT PROPHET Date: October 14, 1936, morning</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Amoy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Acts 21:4, 10-11; 1 Cor 14:3-4</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we want to see the first requirement of a worker.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to see this we have to go back to the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, let us consider the prophets in the Old Testament and their works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE WORK OF THE OLD TESTAMENT PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As far as I can remember, the Old Testament prophets did three things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, they prophesied, which means foretelling things which were about to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many prophets did this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, they spoke for God, announcing God's will to men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some prophets not only prophesied, they were also sent by God to certain men to do a particular thing to announce God's will to those who were ignorant of it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both the prophets and the priests were intermediaries between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Old Testament men could not come to God directly to worship Him; all matters of worship had to be done through the priests cf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 Chron 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the priests were not the only ones who came between God and man; the prophets were also intermediaries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The priests were intermediaries from man to God, whereas the prophets were intermediaries from God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God did not speak to man directly; He spoke through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Pentateuch says that God spoke to Moses, who then spoke to the people and gave them the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Ten Commandments were passed on to the Israelites through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Third, the Old Testament prophets also exhorted and comforted men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These words of exhortation and comfort covered general principles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were like the message we gave this morning announcing to men that God is righteous and that we should serve Him in holiness and righteousness These are the works of the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They prophesied, they announced God's will to men, and they exhorted, comforted, and instructed men concerning general principles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE WORK OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PROPHETS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be clear about one very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While there were three aspects to the work of the Old Testament prophets, there are fewer aspects to the work of New Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Testament prophets only do the first and third aspect of the work of the Old Testament prophets; they do not participate in the second aspect of the work of the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are not clear about this, we will be living according to the Old Testament even though we are in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The work of the New Testament prophets is to annul the second aspect of the work of the Old Testament prophets, which is to tell men what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was an important work of the Old Testament prophets, but the New Testament prophets do not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A New Testament believer prays, gives thanks, praises, or seeks after the Lord without the need of a prophet to act on his behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The greatest blessing for a New Testament believer is the ability to receive the leading of the Holy Spirit, as Hebrews 8:11 says, "And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have many fellow citizens and brothers, but there is no need for them to teach us, saying, "Know the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have the Holy Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit is our prophet today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament there was Nathan, Gad, and many other prophets, in addition to many "fellow citizens."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But in the New Testament, we do not need all these "fellow citizens" to teach and guide us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the New Testament the Holy Spirit has replaced the work of the Old Testament prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we have prophets in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some can prophesy, while others can exhort and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we do not have personal prophets to come and tell us what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If anyone comes to tell us to do this or that, he is not a prophet, but a sorcerer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is true that Agabus and the four daughters of Philip were prophets, and they did prophesy Acts 11:28; 21:8-11 , but the main work of the New Testament prophets is preaching and speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>New Testament prophets seldom prophesy; their main work is the preaching of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Corinthians 14 specifically mentions the work of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 3 clearly says that the main work of the New Testament prophets is for building up, encouraging, and consoling men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It does not mention any foretelling of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This shows that foretelling is an incidental work; sometimes it is done by a few, but it is not the principal work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A prophet cannot give anyone personal guidance; this is the essence of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the New Testament there are no personal prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everyone can know God directly and be led of God and know God's will directly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you have a prophet?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I am ashamed that many people have considered me a prophet, that is, the kind of personal prophet mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The danger of a worker is to burden himself with the work of a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When there are too many personal prophets, the proper place of the New Testament prophet is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The New Testament church does not need any spiritual giants to act as personal prophets to teach others what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>That is the work of the Holy Spirit, not the work of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The main work of the New Testament prophets is for building up, encouraging, and consoling men.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the work that God's workers should do today.</S>
