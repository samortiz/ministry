   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD HAVING MERCY ON WHOM HE WILLS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HARDENING WHOM HE WILLS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I will give you a little testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first time I touched something concerning authority was when I read Romans 9.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This chapter is hard to handle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter Paul showed how the Gentiles were called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First he spoke of Jacob and Esau, and then he spoke of Pharaoh as a negative example.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seems as if God was not fair in these instances.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In man's eyes Jacob was naughty while Esau was honest, yet God loved the wicked Jacob and hated the honest Esau v. 13 . Paul posed the question: "Is there unrighteousness with God?", and his answer was, "Absolutely not!" v. 14 . It was as if Paul was saying, "God can do whatever He wants." If God wants to love Jacob, He can love Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He wants to hate Esau, He can hate Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The human mind may argue about God's treatment of Esau and find God unfair, yet God said to Pharaoh, "For this very thing I have raised you up, that I might show in you My power, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth" v. 17 . Was God unfair in hardening Pharaoh? We have to realize that God sits on His throne of glory, and man is under His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We mortals, who are feeble as dust, have no basis to reason with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I first read the Bible and came to the passage in Exodus where it says that God hardened Pharaoh, I was very surprised.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God shows mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But He also hardens men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is the One who does everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is amazing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In effect, Paul was saying, "How about this for a reason?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is this not a good enough reason?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this reason is good enough, we are stripped of all arguments for Esau and Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some may ask, "Why does He still find fault?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For who withstands His will?" v. 19 . In my youth, when I came across this passage, I said to myself, "I admire anyone who can understand and believe this chapter." When I came to this passage, I thought that it was impossible for Paul to present a perfect argument.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was actually worrying and sweating for him at this point.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet I noticed that Paul did not get into any argument at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, he simply asked, "O man, who are you who answer back to God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus?" v. 20 . Paul did not respond with an argument.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, he asked, "Who are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not a matter of arguments and reasons but a matter of, "Who are you who answers back to God?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is the God of glory, the One who sits on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are simply footstools before His throne; our place is only to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must humble ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have no right to argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot have a round-table meeting with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, we should prostrate in the dust before His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God does not have to consult us before doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He does not need our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only those who are equal with God can argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are we equal with God?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Men try to exalt themselves to be equal with God, but Christ humbled Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, becoming obedient Phil 2:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can we consider ourselves equal with God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul did not bother to give an answer; he did not try to furnish a reason.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead he asked, "Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How dare you say such a thing to God?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Paul fell on his way to Damascus, he only asked, "What shall I do, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts 22:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once a man is enlightened, he can only say, "Lord, what do You want me to do?"</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has no heart to reason anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A servant of God must not reason; he must cast off reason from him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A man must not live in reason, but under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What can the creatures say to the Creator?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Romans 9 tells us only one thing authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is God; He will have mercy on whom He wills, and He will harden whom He wills v. 18 . We have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When God says He loves Jacob, that is whom He wills to love.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When He says that He hates Esau, that is whom He wills to hate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When He says that He will harden a certain man, He wills to harden that man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God acts according to His authority and nothing else; He does not act according to reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to know God's acts, not according to reason but according to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Throughout history no one who truly has known God has been ignorant of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We cannot reason with God, because He is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He sits on the throne, while our place is in the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is beyond our grasp to even try to be His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We dare not look up to His face of glory; we can only look at His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to know God, we can only take the way of submission, not the way of reason.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Unless reason is fully purged from us, we cannot know God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I must strongly repeat: Those who have not been fully delivered from reason can expect little perfecting from God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are limited in capacity and usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we desire to obtain mercy from God and to participate in His work, we have to drive away all our reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In God there is only command and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our place before God is simply obedience and obedience alone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We all admire the measure of life which Madame Guyon had.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We cannot find her arguing with God even once.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She never reasoned with God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Authority is diametrically opposed to reason.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We read in God's Word that He loved Jacob and hated Esau and that He shows mercy to whom He wills and hardens whom He wills.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we are truly enlightened by this word, all our reasons will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We serve God because He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He does not reason with us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The One we serve is God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When God says something, it is done.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He is sovereign over everything; He is the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>His glory is unmatched in every way; it is beyond man's reach.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once we reason with God, there is no more worship.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Once obedience disappears, worship disappears also.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Man's reason cannot stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God never argues with man.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He only asks, "Who are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Once we prostrate ourselves in the dust, all desire for reasoning goes away.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have nothing to say before God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The only thing we can do is to stand in obedience.</S>
