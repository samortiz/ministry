   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. OTHERS A. False Condemnation and Imprisonment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee was arrested in March 1952.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was judged, falsely condemned, and sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment in 1956.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He died in confinement on May 30, 1972.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no way to know what he experienced of the Lord during this long imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The following eight letters were written at the end of his confinement in his own handwriting and are the only means through which we can see a small glimpse of his suffering, feeling, and expectation during his confinement.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Letter One</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>April 22, 1972</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eldest Sister Pin-cheng,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I received your letter of April 7, and found that you had not received my letter, in which I notified you that the things you sent me every time have been received.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the things you mentioned in your letter I have received.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am very grateful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You know my physical condition is chronic, an illness of the organ itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When it is activated I suffer much, but even when it is latent, it is still present with me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The difference is whether or not it is activated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Summer is here, and although more exposure to the sun can alter a little the color of my skin, it cannot change the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, I maintain my joy, so please do not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope you will also take care of yourself and be filled with joy in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I wish you well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Shu-tsu</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
