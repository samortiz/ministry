<p>We need to exercise faith toward the Lord, and look to Him for His blessing and His leading. We do not discuss money when someone is sent out for the work. This is an established practice among us. It is wrong for a person to think that because the work sends him out, it will also give him a specific amount of money. This is not our practice. When we first came to Taiwan, the work did not arrange for any money to be given to me. The only one who supplied me was my senior co-worker, Brother Watchman Nee. In 1933 when I was struggling with the decision of leaving my job and serving the Lord full time, Brother Nee was returning to China on a ship in the Mediterranean Sea, and he wrote me a letter confirming my decision to serve the Lord. When I received the letter, I was surprised, and I felt it was from the Lord; hence, I made a special trip to Shanghai to visit him. He asked me to stay in Shanghai for three or four months. Once during that time, he came to the place where I was staying and said, &ldquo;Brother Witness, the Lord has given this for your use.&rdquo; He then left me an envelope. That was the first time that he supplied me financially, and it is deeply engraved on my heart.</p>
<p>Later when he took the lead in the work to send me to Taiwan, in either April or May of 1949, he personally gave me three hundred U.S. dollars. That was how I came to Taiwan. My household consisted of twelve people: my wife and I, our eight children, and two helpers whom we could not leave behind. We came as a household of twelve people and lived in a Japanese style house that was about three hundred square feet.</p>
<p>At that time most of the brothers and sisters who came from mainland China fled to Taiwan with the government. Few people were wealthy. It was at this time that two Chinese brothers from Manila came to Taiwan and saw the needs of the work. This was of the Lord. They bought a piece of land and gave it to the church. This is part of the land on which hall one of the church in Taipei stands. They also built a small meeting hall on the land, and we began to meet in it.</p>
<p>After the work began on August 1, 1949, it spread rapidly, and the meeting hall was no longer adequate. Behind the meeting hall was a piece of land that had only the concrete foundations of houses that were bombed during the war. A Taiwanese man was using the land to grow vegetables. We felt to buy his rights to the land, and he agreed to sell his rights to us for almost two hundred U.S. dollars. We then went to the Bureau of National Assets for the parcel number of the land and to find out if it had been sold to anyone. It had not been sold, so we immediately applied to buy the land. In those days land was very cheap, and we purchased it for less than one thousand U.S. dollars. This is the land on which hall one stands.</p>
<p>In November 1950 I went to the Philippines to begin the work there, and I stayed there for five and a half months. As I was about to leave the saints, a brother who was a businessman made an appointment and met with me. He said that he would cover all the expenses for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taiwan, regardless of how much it was. Even though I said that we never tell people how much money the work needs, he insisted that I was not telling him; rather, it was he who was asking me to please let him know how much was needed. From that time onward, for a period of eleven years, this brother bore the financial responsibility for the work in Taiwan. The land for most of the meeting halls in Taiwan was purchased during those years. This was the Lord&rsquo;s provision.</p>
<p>The Lord has blessed us not only in relation to our numbers and the work; He has also blessed us in material things. We should not go by what we see; we must be determined to do whatever the Lord wants us to do.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S MONETARY BLESSING</h2>
<p>When I went to America to begin the work there, I was empty-handed, just as I was when I came to Taiwan. At the time I was still responsible for the monthly living expenses of several co-workers in Taiwan. The Lord began the work in America, and He is still blessing it to this day. We obtained a large meeting hall in Anaheim, California, and another one in Irving, Texas. These two meeting halls were given to us by the Lord. I am fellowshipping these matters because I want everyone to believe that the Lord blesses His work.</p>
<p>The publication work of the ministry office is taken care of at three stations. One station is in Anaheim, the second station is our printing section in Irving, and the third station is the Taiwan Gospel Book Room in Taipei. There are more than sixty full-time serving ones in these three places. There are more than twice that number of volunteers who come in to work; there are more than one hundred twenty volunteers. All of this has been accomplished by the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
