Indicated in the Later Epistles of the New Testament</h2><p>[The recovery of the church is fully revealed in the New Testament even though the word &#8220;recovery&#8217;&#8217; is not used. This recovery is revealed mainly in the later Epistles of the New Testament. We do not find the recovery of the church in such Epistles as Romans or 1 Corinthians, but we do find it in Titus, 2 Timothy, 2 John, and Revelation. In these later writings of the New Testament the recovery is fully unveiled.]<p>[For the recovery of the church, we need to be separated from the factious-the sects and denominations. This is indicated by Paul&#8217;s word in Titus 3:10. &#8220;A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse.&#8217;&#8217; A factious man is a sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions. A factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected. This is to stop intercourse with a contagiously divisive person for the church&#8217;s benefit.<p>Nearly all believers today are factious. They honor, respect, and uplift their denominations. Furthermore, they nourish and build their denominations. Hence, they are builders of sects and denominations. Millions of Christians today are members of these sects. Because they are members of sects, we cannot join them, even though they may be genuine brothers in Christ. We surely love our brothers in Christ, but they are in the denominations and the sects, where we cannot be. It is not that we separate ourselves from other believers; it is that the sects and denominations separate us from the church life. If we are to share in the recovery of the church, we need to be separated from all the sects and denominations. Like Ezra, Nehemiah, and other faithful ones in the Old Testament, we need to leave Babylon and come back to Jerusalem.]<h2 class=head2>C. To Be Recovered:</h2><h2 class=head3>1. From the Divisive and Apostate Ground with Its Deviation from the Truths concerning:</h2><h2 class=head4>a. The Person of the Triune God</h2><p>[We need to be recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truth concerning the person of the Triune God. During the centuries, three main schools of teaching concerning the Trinity have emerged: modalism, tritheism, and the pure revelation according to the Bible. Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time, but are merely three temporary manifestations of the one God. Tritheism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three Gods. We should have nothing to do with modalism, for that extreme view of the Trinity is a heresy. It is also a great heresy to teach that there are three Gods.]<p>[The truth concerning the person of the Triune God is twofold.] [The twofoldness of the truth concerning the Trinity is embodied in the word &#8220;triune.&#8217;&#8217; This adjective is actually a Latin word composed of two parts: tri-, meaning three, and -une, meaning one. The word triune, therefore, means three-one. On the one hand, our God is uniquely one; on the other hand, He is three. In the aspect of God&#8217;s being one, there is no separation between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. However, in the aspect of God&#8217;s being three, there is a distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me&#8217;&#8217; (John 14:10). Because the Father and the Son are mutually in each other, They cannot be separated. Nevertheless, there is still a distinction between the Father and the Son.]<h2 class=head4>b. The Person and Work of Christ</h2><p>We also need to be recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truth concerning the person and work of Christ. Some deny that Jesus is the Christ (1 John 2:22-23). These people deny the deity of Christ, not confessing that the Man Jesus is God becoming a man. In turn, these also reject Christ&#8217;s redemption, insisting that His death was a martyrdom rather than for our redemption. According to 1 Cor. 15:12-17, some do not believe that Christ resurrected. If He did not resurrect, then we have no proof of our justification (Rom. 4:25), and He would not be the life-giving Spirit to regenerate and transform us. Therefore, the church needs to be recovered from this apostate condition also.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> </body></html>
