   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Giving the Son to Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Father has also given the Son to us John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Son given to us by the Father is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, when the Son is given, the Father also is given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the Father to give us the Son means that the Father gives us Himself in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Dwelling in Us with the Son by the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father dwells in us with the Son and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we have the Father dwelling in us with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First John 3:24 says, "In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see that the Father dwells in us not only with the Son but also by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning this matter, 1 John 4:13 says, "In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given us of His Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Who is dwelling in us?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should answer this question by saying that the Father dwells in us with the Son by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, we have the Triune God dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us go on to consider a number of matters related to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Expression, the Accomplisher</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Son is the expression of the Father: "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him" John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Father is the source, and the Son is His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the expression of the Father, the Son is the Accomplisher.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Father is the Initiator, the Originator, the Planner, and the Designer, and the Son carries out what the Father has initiated, originated, planned, and designed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the Son, the expression of the Father, is the Accomplisher.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Coming with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 6:46 says, "Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is from with lit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God, He has seen the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And John 8:29 says, "He who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These verses reveal that when the Son came, He did not come alone, but came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Tabernacling among Us</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 1:14 reveals that the Son tabernacled among us: "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 16:4b also refers to this: "Now these things I did not say to you from the beginning, because I was with you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son is God's tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, as God's tabernacle, He is God embodied among us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Coming in the Name of the Father</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord says in John 5:43, "I have come in the name of My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Son came not only with the Father, but also in the Father's name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that He came as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, He, as the Son given to us, is called the Father Isa 9:6 .</S>
