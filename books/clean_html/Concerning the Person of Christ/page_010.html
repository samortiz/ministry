<p>There are numerous verses in the Epistles which state that the Lord is Lord as well as the Son of God, thus strengthening the evidence that He has God’s divine nature and the Godhead. In addition to these, the following few verses clearly and definitely show us that our Lord is God; He is no less than the unique God Himself. &#147;Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever&#148; (Rom. 9:5). This word cannot be more clear in saying that Christ is God blessed forever. &#147;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all&#148; (2 Cor. 13:14, ASV). Here the Lord is placed on the same level as God and the Holy Spirit. This proves that the Lord has the same divine nature and the Godhead as God and the Holy Spirit.</p><p>&#147;Who [Christ Jesus] subsisting in the form of God…&#148; (Phil. 2:6), and &#147;Who [the Son of His love] is the image of the invisible God…&#148; (Col. 1:15). The Lord not only has the form of God, but He is the image of God, for He is the very God. Colossians 2:2 and 9 tell us that the mystery of God is Christ and that in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. All that God is is Christ; all that is of the Godhead rests in Christ, for He is God Himself. &#147;And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, who was manifested in the flesh…&#148; (1 Tim. 3:16). Christ in the flesh was God manifested in the flesh. It was actually the flesh, yet God was manifested in it! This is really a great mystery! Christ who became a man was God manifested in the flesh, and He is God Himself! &#147;Who [Christ] being the effulgence of His [God’s] glory and the express image of His substance&#148; (Heb 1:3). In the foregoing passage we have seen that Christ is God manifested, and here it says that He is the effulgence of God’s glory, the express image of His substance. He is God’s expression, His manifestation. &#147;But as to the Son…O God…&#148; (Heb. 1:8) is a quotation from Psalm 45:6 proving that the Son (Christ) is God. Following this, in verses 10 to 12, there is a quote from Psalm 102:25-27 proving that He is the God who is the same and whose years shall not fail. &#147;And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life&#148; (1 John 5:20). It says here that the Son of God is the true One. He is come that we may know Him who is true and that we may be in Him who is true. This true One is the true God, and He is eternal life. According to 1 John 1:2, &#147;eternal life&#148; refers to the Lord Himself. Hence, here it also tells us that the Lord is the true God.</p><p>There are also many verses in Revelation defining the Lord’s nature: &#147;From Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth&#148; (Rev. 1:4-5). Here the Lord is placed on the same level as God and the Holy Spirit, proving that He has the divine nature and the Godhead, just as do God and the Holy Spirit. &#147;I am the First and the Last…&#148; (Rev. 1:17). Revelation 2:8 and 22:13 also say the same thing. The First and the Last in the universe surely is the God who is from eternity to eternity (Psa. 90:2). Hence this word also proves that the Lord is the eternal God. In Revelation 2:18, the Lord refers to Himself as &#147;the Son of God.&#148; Here once again, the Lord Himself admits He has the divine nature and the Godhead. The terms &#147;the Root of David&#148; and &#147;the Offspring of David&#148; are used in Revelation 5:5 and 22:16 in reference to the Lord. Just as the offspring of David denotes that the Lord is man, and He came out of David; so the Root of David denotes He is God, and David came out of Him. &#147;To Him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb, be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever&#148; (Rev. 5:13). The Lamb here refers to the Lord. This verse states that He and God together receive equal praises from every creature in the universe. This proves He and God are one and He is equal with God in honor and glory. &#147;For its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb&#148; (Rev. 21:22). This verse shows us that the Lord and God are the temple (singular number), proving that the Lord and God are one. &#147;For the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb&#148; (Rev. 21:23). Just as the light is in the lamp and is one body with the lamp, so God is in Christ and is one body with Christ. God is the content of Christ, and Christ is the expression of God. Christ and God are one. In the phrase, &#147;the throne of God and of the Lamb&#148; (Rev. 22:1), the word throne is singular. God and the Lamb share one throne—this also places the Lord on an equal level with God. According to the preceding passage, God is the light, and the Lord is the lamp; therefore, God is in the Lord. It must be that God is in the Lord sitting on the throne. Otherwise how could two sit on the same throne together? In any case, these passages all prove that the Lord and God are one. In Revelation 22:13 the Lord Jesus says, &#147;I am the Alpha and the Omega.&#148; However, in Revelation 1:8, it is the Lord God who says, &#147;I am the Alpha and the Omega.&#148; This unmistakably proves that the Lord is God, &#147;He who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.&#148; Following that, He says that He is &#147;the First and the Last, the beginning and the end&#148; (Rev. 22:13). Our Lord is the God who is self-existing and ever-existing, without beginning and without end, yet who is the beginning and the end. May we offer up to Him the worship which He as God is worthy to receive! May we forever praise Him as God, the true God, the perfect and complete God! Amen! Hallelujah!</p>
