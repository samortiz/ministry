   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Apt to Teach</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The next qualification of the elders is to be apt to teach v. 2 . The word apt means tending, inclined, likely.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>An overseer should be able to teach, but the point here is that he must be willing to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This kind of teaching is not like that of schoolteachers but like parents teaching in the home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Schoolteachers teach students in schools because it is their job, but parents teaching of their children at home should be a habit in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have children, we should not only love our children but also have a habit to teach and instruct them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not merely command our children to do their homework but should instead offer our help.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what it means to be apt to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The elders must have the habit and the willingness to teach the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An elder s gift or ability to teach is of secondary importance; primarily, he must be concerned for the saints learning and build up a willingness and a habit to teach the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being apt to teach is another test of our genuine concern for the church and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is also a test of how much patience we have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if an elder has great ability, he must also be patient in order to properly teach the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not adequate to give messages; we must be willing to sit with a brother for several hours to help him see some crucial aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although this will exhaust us and test us, it should not be something that we merely tolerate but something that we are inclined to do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many saints in the church require individual help in learning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the phrase apt to teach the apostle Paul indicates that an overseer must have the concern, the willingness, and the habit to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not an Excessive Drinker</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first qualification in verse 3 is not an excessive drinker.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Like temperate and of a sober mind, this is a matter of self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some may argue that according to the wording here, the elders may drink but not excessively.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, it is quite difficult for people to control themselves once they begin drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, in order to control ourselves, it is best not to drink at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this matter we must control ourselves to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not a Striker, but Gentle</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The next item in verse 3 is not a striker, but gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is related to the preceding qualification because many who drink excessively are strikers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When people are drinking, they cannot control their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The basic thought here is that we need to be calm and cool.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because drinking agitates and excites our temper, we should not drink.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are calm, we will not quarrel or be a striker.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be gentle, or mild, is to be agreeable and flexible in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Paul s word, to be an overseer is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not Contentious</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 3 then says, Not contentious.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To be contentious is to be quarrelsome.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only should we not be a striker, but we should not even be quarrelsome.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All these items indicate that an overseer must be very self-controlled, mild, and moderate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>An overseer should never lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The elders cannot contend or fight with other saints but must be lenient and flexible with everyone in every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not Fond of Money</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lastly, verse 3 says, Not fond of money.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To be greedy is a matter of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every lust needs to be controlled, bridled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To not be fond of money is to bridle our lust for money.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everyone has this lust, but an overseer must learn how to control it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The lust in our flesh is expressed mainly in sex, temper, and greed, or covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These three areas are dealt with in the apostle s charge: to be the husband of one wife is to control sexual lust; to be temperate, not a striker, and not contentious but gentle is to control our temper; and to not be fond of money is to bridle our lust for money.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most of the qualifications of the elders in these verses are related to controlling these three kinds of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>An elder must be one who exercises strict control in these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE QUALIFICATIONS IN 1 TIMOTHY 3:1-7</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>ACTUALLY BEING A REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>OF WHAT THE RESURRECTION LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>OF THE INDWELLING CHRIST CAN DO IN US</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The self-control that is required of an overseer is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As elders we must live a life that has been dealt with by the cross of Christ so that the resurrection power will enable us to exercise such self-control.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not say that no one can meet these requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If no one could make it, the apostle Paul would not have written it, nor would it be included in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These qualifications are not a kind of law or commandment; instead, they show us what the Lord can do within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is like the constitution of the kingdom in Matthew 5 7, which not only indicates what the kingdom requires but also proves and testifies how much the resurrection life can do within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We believe God s living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whatever the Lord says will come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, we need to trust in His Word, receive it, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not be disappointed by our apparent shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead, we should be encouraged that because the Word includes these qualifications, the resurrection life will produce them in us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should not isolate 1 Timothy 3:1-7 from the rest of the Epistle, which reveals the eternal life, God s economy, which is His dispensing, and the manifestation of God in the flesh 6:12, 19; 1:4; 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, 1 Timothy 3:1-7 is actually a revelation of how much the resurrection life of the indwelling Christ can do in us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By ourselves we cannot meet these requirements, but the indwelling Christ can certainly meet them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, we must be willing to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our flesh, old man, and natural life have been crucified on the cross, and it is now Christ who lives in us Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to cooperate with Him by having a desire and a willingness and by praying much.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we wait on the Lord, He will work out all these things from within us.</S>
