   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. By the Ascended Head Giving the Gifts to His Body</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The intrinsic building up of the church is by the ascended Head giving the gifts Eph 4:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 4:8 says, "Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may appreciate the Lord's coming down from the heavens, but we also need an uplifted appreciation of His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Ephesians 4:8, Paul points out that it is the ascended Christ who is able to give the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Paul said that Christ "ascended to the height,'' he quoted from Psalm 68:18.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Height'' in this verse refers to Mount Zion Psa 68:15-16 , symbolizing the third heaven, where God dwells 1 Kings 8:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 1 of Psalm 68 is a quotation of Numbers 10:35.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It indicates that the background of Psalm 68 is God's move in the tabernacle with the ark as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Wherever the ark, a type of Christ, went, the victory was won.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, this ark ascended triumphantly to the top of Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This portrays how Christ has won the victory and ascended triumphantly to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His ascension, Christ "led captive those taken captive.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The redeemed saints had been taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were captives under Satan's hand through sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But Christ defeated Satan, solved the problem of sin and death, and rescued us out of the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then He led us to the heavens as His captives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He took these captives and made them gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One of these gifts was Saul of Tarsus, who later became Paul, the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He had been a captive of Satan and a top sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In First Timothy 1:15 Paul said that he was "the foremost'' sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was a big captive of Satan under sin and death, but one day Christ rescued him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was on the way to Damascus to arrest those who called on the Lord's name Acts 9:1-2, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the Lord Jesus seized him and rescued him out of the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Saul was Satan's captive, but he became Christ's captive.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Saul of Tarsus had been opposing Christ and devastating the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suddenly he became a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ took this one and made him a gift by the name of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He became a gift who could expound the Old Testament, who could preach the gospel, teach the saints, and prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How could Paul become such a gift?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He himself tells us with a parenthetical word in Ephesians 4:9-10: "Now this, He ascended, what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He who descended is the same who also ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.''</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul was a wonderful writer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He wrote this portion in describing Christ's death and resurrection to accomplish His full redemption and impart life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ first descended to the earth from the heavenly throne in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He did this through the process of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then He entered into death, and in death He descended further.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the second step of His descension, He descended into the lower parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This refers to Hades, underneath the earth, where Christ went after His death Acts 2:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first step of Christ's descension was for His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second step was for His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His descension was the means to accomplish His all-inclusive, full redemption, which has saved us from sin, death, Satan, and the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the first step of His ascension, He ascended from Hades to the earth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His resurrection, He imparted life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His descension accomplished redemption, and His ascension accomplished the impartation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the second step of His ascension, He brought us to the Father in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When He ascended before His disciples into heaven Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9-11 , they did not fully understand what was going on.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They only saw Jesus ascending.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the Scriptures reveal that when Jesus was ascending, He was ascending with a train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Amplified New Testament renders "He led a train of vanquished foes'' for "He led captive those taken captive.''</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When He was ascending, He was a returning General who had won the victory over Satan, sin, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He defeated all of His enemies, and He had many captives.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He brought these captives with Him in a procession to celebrate His victory.</S>
