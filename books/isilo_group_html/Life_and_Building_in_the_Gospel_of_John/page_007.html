<h1 class="title">LIFE BEING IN THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will pay attention to the first half of John 1:4, which says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BEING THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we said that if sensible and thoughtful people only acknowledge the fact that there is God in the universe, God will still be objective, distant, and mysterious to them. Acknowledging God does not mean that they have contacted, touched, or obtained God. For them, God is beyond their reach. This is not only the case with ordinary people; even religious people, who devoutly worship God, will not contact or obtain God if they do not know Him as the Word. We all must know that God is no longer merely objective; He is also the Word.</p>
<p>This mysterious matter is conveyed in simple yet profound words at the beginning of the Gospel of John. In the universe God is not only God but also the Word. Without God being the Word, we would not be able to understand Him or touch Him. God can be likened to electricity. No one has ever seen electricity, but the light produced by electricity is the expression and manifestation of electricity. Electricians can study electricity only through its manifestations. This is a very good illustration. The manifestation of electricity makes electricity subjective in our lives; it is no longer merely objective to us.</p>
<p>If God did not speak, express, or manifest Himself, He would be unapproachable, incomprehensible, uncontactable, and unobtainable. Thankfully, the Bible tells us that God is not only God but also the Word (v. 1). He is God as the Word, and He is God coming to us as the Word. A word is an utterance. If a person stands on a podium and says nothing, no one will know his thoughts or feelings. However, as soon as he opens his mouth to speak, words will come forth from within him. The more he speaks, the more his person will be manifested. The more he speaks, the more transparent his utterances will be and the more people will understand him. Hence, God&rsquo;s being the Word and God&rsquo;s coming as the Word are God being declared. As the Word, God is no longer a hidden, mysterious God but the God who comes forth. This manifested God, who speaks forth Himself, is our Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus bears a particular title in the Bible&mdash;<em>Word.</em> John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus, in whom we believe, is not separate from God. He is God Himself; He is God coming forth and being manifested. Therefore, the Bible speaks of Him being the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 1:3), just as light is the effulgence of electricity.</p>
<p>Some say that it would be easier to understand John 1:1-2 if we substituted <em>Lord</em> for <em>Word:</em> &ldquo;In the beginning was the Lord, and the Lord was with God, and the Lord was God. The Lord was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; However, John did not write in this way, because if he spoke only of God as the Lord, a sense of God&rsquo;s coming forth would not be conveyed. God is the Word in order to come forth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Word, God&rsquo;s coming forth. When the hidden God is revealed, He is revealed as the Word, and the Word who was manifested is the Lord Jesus. In the Lord Jesus, God as the Word came forth to manifest and release Himself in order to be comprehended, known, understood, contacted, and obtained by man. Thus, the Lord Jesus is particularly named the Word. He is the utterance of God, the declaration of God; He is God coming forth to be received and obtained by man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING THE WORD THAT MAN MAY HAVE LIFE</h2>
<p>John 1:4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; In the God who came forth, there was life; in the God who was manifested and expressed, there was life. In God as the Word, there was life. God is the Word in order for man to have life. Without God being the Word, man would have no way to receive Him as life. Man would be able to worship, fear, thank, and praise God, but he would not be able to receive God as life. In order for God to be man&rsquo;s life, He must be the Word to come forth to man, among man, and into man.</p>
<p>Whenever we think of God, our natural concepts always involve fearing Him, worshipping Him, serving Him, or doing good to please Him. We never think of life. Everyone in the world thinks of God in this way, because the thought of God being life is not a human concept; it is a divine concept. The apostle John, however, received a revelation and burden from God to present this exceedingly mysterious matter in simple words. He revealed that God did not desire to withhold Himself from man but that He was the Word who could come forth as the Word and in whom was life. I hope that we can fully understand that God is the Word in order that man can obtain God as life.</p>
<p>When I was a new believer in the Lord, I would act very devoutly whenever I read the Bible, especially the Gospels. I would kneel down and solemnly pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Lord who created heaven and earth. You are my Redeemer. I will now read Your biography, Your Gospels. I hope to meet You here.&rdquo; Even though I regarded the Gospels as the Lord&rsquo;s biography, I would always be surprised by what I read because the Lord who is presented in the Gospels was not according to my concept. I considered Him to be a glorious Lord, full of majesty and power, but the Bible showed that He was so approachable. He talked with children (Mark 10:13-16; Matt. 19:14), walked by the sea (4:18; 15:29; Mark 2:13), and went to the mountains (13:3). When a Samaritan woman was drawing water from a well, He asked her for a drink (John 4:7). The Gospels rarely speak of Him in a high and lofty way.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John tells us that He is the Word. The unbelievers do not understand the significance of the Lord being the Word, and even Christians do not understand. The Word is God&rsquo;s utterance. When we read the Gospels, we should realize that the descriptions contained in the Gospels are the utterances of God. As the Word, Christ is the coming forth of God in order for God to be received through hearing. God does not want man to worship and serve Him objectively. God&rsquo;s only desire is for man to receive Him. The Lord Jesus was truly unique on the earth because He was the Word of God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
