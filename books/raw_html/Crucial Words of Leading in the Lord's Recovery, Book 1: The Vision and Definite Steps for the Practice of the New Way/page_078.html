<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
IN A CRAZY WAY</h2>
<p>We must be persons who are burning in spirit and crazy before God. Whether we are visiting the communities or going to a meeting, we must prepare ourselves by first being crazy at home. I once said that John Sung was called a mad preacher. He was a person who was absolutely beside himself before God. Once, as a meeting was waiting for him, he suddenly appeared at the back door, singing as he entered, &ldquo;Down with Satan, down with Satan; out with sin, out with sin!&rdquo; As he sang, the entire congregation came alive. He was dressed in a traditional Chinese long gown. As he stepped onto the podium, he would pull out some gambling cards from his sleeves and sing, &ldquo;Down with card games, down with card games; out with gambling, out with gambling!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Down with mah-jongg, down with mah-jongg; out with the devil, out with the devil!&rdquo; At times he would hold out an opium pipe and sing, &ldquo;Down with the pipe, down with the pipe; out with opium, out with opium!&rdquo; At the end he would hold up a little coffin in his hand and say, &ldquo;Do you want to go on with your gambling? Your gambling will lead you to the coffin. Do you want to hold on to your opium? Your opium will lead you down to the coffin.&rdquo; After this he would sing again, &ldquo;Down with the coffin, down with the coffin; out with death, out with death!&rdquo; Finally, he would make the call, saying, &ldquo;All those who want to be finished with these things, please come to the front.&rdquo; A great crowd always would come to the front, weeping and crying as they walked forward, saying, &ldquo;I want to be finished, finished, finished with these things!&rdquo; This is the way John Sung preached the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION AND NEED FOR BEING CRAZY</h2>
<p>In conducting any meeting and in working for the Lord, our first need is to be beside ourselves before God. Such &ldquo;craziness&rdquo; cannot be imitated. We must first pray thoroughly, confess our sins, and be cleansed before we can be filled with the Lord and His riches. Once His riches fill us, we will spontaneously be beside ourselves. Hence, in order to be crazy, we must first confess our sins, repent, pray, enjoy the Lord, contact Him, and be filled and clothed with His riches. Then when we come to the meeting, whether we sing or teach the truth, we will be full of impact. All those listening to us will be affected. After doing this once or twice, the saints will not need to wait for us to take the lead to be crazy; they themselves will become crazy.</p>
<p>Our meetings should not be old and stale, routinely starting with a hymn followed by some prayers. We should be beside ourselves in our homes before the meeting. We should stir up our spirit at home and then come to the meeting hall with singing or prayer. As we arrive, we should sing, praise, and pray with one another. This kind of meeting will surely bring in God&rsquo;s grace and His timely speaking.</p>
<p>During the past three months every time we met together, I sensed no living prayers. Most of the time it was the full-timers who prayed in a fervent way. The co-workers and elders were quiet and observing. If the co-workers and elders do not know how to be crazy and beside themselves, how can they lead the churches? In order for the churches to go on, there must be proper leadership, and in order to have proper leadership, the elders must be crazy. My wife often says to me, &ldquo;The minute you speak, you forget about yourself. You forget about everything.&rdquo; This is what we all should do. As soon as we come to the meeting, we should be beside ourselves. As soon as we speak for the Lord, we should be crazy. Only a person with a crazy spirit can conduct a meeting and make it come alive.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING AND WALKING BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Being crazy has nothing to do with the outer man; it has to do with the inner man. We are crazy when our spirit is filled with the Lord&rsquo;s Spirit. If we are persons who live and walk in the spirit, as soon as we walk into the meeting the atmosphere will be changed. We have a spirit. If we use our spirit and live in our spirit as we choose a hymn, our choosing will be full of the spirit, and our singing will be full of the spirit. Our praying, reading, and speaking will all be full of the spirit. This is the basic qualification for conducting a meeting. If we do not use our spirit, our teaching of <em>Truth Lessons</em> will be nothing but dead reading, dead teaching, dead speaking, and dead listening. This is worse than the teaching in secular schools.</p>
<p>Not only do we need to live in the spirit; we must also stir up the spirit of all those in the meeting. The best way to stir up the spirit is to sing. I encourage us all to learn to sing our hymns. In particular, we should present this matter to the saints. We should tell them, &ldquo;When we come to the meeting, we should not be bound and reserved. We are not here to attend a so-called &lsquo;worship service&rsquo; of a denomination. We meet to release our spirit and to fellowship with one another in the spirit, receiving spiritual supply and spiritual infilling. In order to do this, we need to open up our spirit and stir up our spirit.&rdquo; As the saints come to the meeting, we must encourage them and instruct them in this way. They should pray and sing in threes and fives to stir up their spirit and to enliven the atmosphere of the meeting. If we do this, our meetings will be different.</p>
