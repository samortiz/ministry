<p>The other part of Galatians 2:20 is also very important: &ldquo;And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God.&rdquo; Christ lives in us. From this point forward, we live by faith in the Son of God. We believe daily that the Son of God lives in us. We say to the Lord, &ldquo;I believe that You are living for me. You are my life; I believe that You are living in me.&rdquo; When we believe this way, we live this way. No matter what happens, we will no longer make any move. The fundamental lesson of Romans 7 is that we should not make any resolutions. The basic teaching is that it is better that we not will to do anything, because such a willing is useless. Since it is useless to do anything by ourselves, we should simply stop all our moves.</p>
<p>The purpose of Satan&rsquo;s temptation is not only for us to sin but also for the old man within us to move. When temptation comes, we must learn to refuse to move and to say to the Lord, &ldquo;This is not my business. This is Your business. I look to You to live in my place.&rdquo; Always learn to look to Him. Never try to move on your own. We are saved through faith, not through works. In the same way our life is based on faith, not on works. We were saved through looking to the Lord alone. Today we live through looking to Him as well. Just as salvation is accomplished by the Lord, without the involvement of any of our work, so also our living on earth today is a living of the Lord Himself, without the need for any involvement of ourselves. We must look up to the Lord who saves us and say, &ldquo;It is You alone, not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After we say this, if we still move on our own, we are saying this in vain. We must stop our own activity before these words can be meaningful in any way. Brothers and sisters, we must remember that failure comes not because we do too little, but because we do too much. As long as man keeps on working, God&rsquo;s grace will not operate and man&rsquo;s sins will not be forgiven. In the same way, as long as man is occupied with his own work, trying to do everything by himself, Christ&rsquo;s life will not be manifested. This is a rule. The cross will not produce any effect on those who trust in their own work. When we insist on our own goodness, we will not be saved. But when we turn away from ourselves to the Lord, we will be saved. The same is true today. If we are working and operating, instead of the cross working in us and the life of Christ operating in us, this speaking will be in vain. We must learn to condemn ourselves. We must confess that we will never overcome by ourselves. Do not will and do not try to do anything. Simply look to the Lord and say, &ldquo;I look to You as the One who is living in me! Live on my behalf. I look to You for victory! I look to You to express Your life through me.&rdquo; If we say this, the Lord will accomplish it for us. But if we frustrate our faith by our own work, the Lord can do nothing. We have to settle this question once and for all. We have to believe daily and speak to the Lord daily in a definite way: &ldquo;Lord, I am useless! I take Your cross. Lord, keep me from moving. Lord, be my Master and live out of me.&rdquo; If we can believe, hope, and trust in this way, we will be able to testify daily, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
