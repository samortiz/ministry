   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Equal to Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Circumcision in the Old Testament is the equivalent of baptism in the New Testament Col 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both baptism and circumcision have the same purpose to terminate our natural being and bring us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why are we baptized after believing in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because we realize that our old man has been crucified with Him and that we must be buried so that we may be one with Him in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, Abraham's circumcision has the same significance as our baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In both circumcision and baptism the principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although Abraham was justified in Genesis 15, he was circumcised in Genesis 17.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As circumcision was the sign of Abraham's being justified, so baptism is the mark of our being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can we prove that we have been saved?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By living a life of baptism, a life of one who has been crucified, buried, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we live such a life, everyone will be able to see upon us the mark of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>4 Corresponding to the Changing of Human Names</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Circumcision corresponds to the changing of human names 17:5-6, 15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have seen, to change the name is to change the person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Abraham's name was changed, his person was changed also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was especially true of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Jacob's name was changed to Israel, his person was changed 32:27-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This change of name can only be accomplished through circumcision, through having ourselves terminated and ushered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then we are no longer a natural person but a resurrected person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Being terminated and ushered into resurrection is the real changing of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, circumcision corresponds to the changing of names.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now we can understand why the changing of names and circumcision are both revealed in the same chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two things are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The changing of names and circumcision both mean to terminate our old being and to bring us into resurrection so that we may be another person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>b Not Outwardly in the Flesh, in the Letter,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>but Inwardly of the Heart, in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 2:28-29 says that circumcision is not "outward in the flesh," but "of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Circumcision is not an outward matter; it is an inward one Phil 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same is true of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Baptism should not just be a form; it must be an inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me tell you a story that I heard more than forty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Central America, the Catholic Church accepted and baptized as members many people who were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day, a certain priest sprinkled a few drops of water on a boy's head and changed his name to John.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time, the Catholic Church insisted that on Fridays its people eat only fish, not meat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One Friday, this John had only meat to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since the priest had sprinkled water on his head and had changed his name to John, he thought that he could do the same to the meat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, he sprinkled water on it and called the meat fish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He then proceeded to cook the meat by boiling it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As he was boiling the meat, the priest came by.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Smelling the aroma of boiling meat, he was angry with John and asked him what he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John replied, "I am doing nothing wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not meat; it is fish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Don't you remember sprinkling water on me and changing my name to John?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I followed your way and sprinkled water on the meat and called it fish."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not real baptism nor the genuine changing of names.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Baptism must be an inward reality in the spirit, not an outward form of sprinkling a few drops of water on a person's head.</S>
