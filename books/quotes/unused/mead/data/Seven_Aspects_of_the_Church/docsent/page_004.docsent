   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S DWELLING PLACE IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:22 we see that the church is God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, the dwelling place of God is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are not in our spirit, we do not have the church as God's dwelling place in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But whenever we turn to our spirit, we sense that God has a dwelling place in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This dwelling place is for God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE WARRIOR</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Finally, in chapter six we see that the church is a warrior to defeat God's enemy, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to fight the spiritual warfare, we need both the power of the Lord and also the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his subtlety, Satan will allow Christians to do things that are scriptural and spiritual, as long as they do not have the Body or the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most Christians do not even realize that the church is the new man, a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They may speak a little regarding the church as the Bride of Christ or as God's family, but they have no concept that the church is God's present kingdom or God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Defeating the Enemy and Preparing the Way for the Lord to Come Back</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not only is the church the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, and the dwelling place; the church is also the warrior to fight against God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's enemy, Satan, is terrified of such a church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Satan is not afraid of individualistic Christians, not even if they number in the thousands.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But whenever the believers come together as the church in the aspect of the Body and in these other aspects, Satan trembles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By the church in these seven aspects Christ is expressed, the Father has rest, and the enemy is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May we all see the vision that the church is not a matter of individual holiness or spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the contrary, it is a matter of being built up together as the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, the dwelling place, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As such a church, we defeat the enemy and prepare the way for the Lord Jesus to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>WHY WE ARE HERE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Can you find these seven aspects of the church in Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning the church, Christianity has missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We in the Lord's recovery are not here merely for soul-winning, for Bible study, or for spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are here for the expression of the Body on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are also here to be the new man and the Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At present, Christ is preparing us to be His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day the wedding will come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That will be the fulfillment of Revelation 19.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we are preparing for that day, we are the church in the aspects of the family, the kingdom, the dwelling place, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord that we are His family!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we came into the church life, we had the sense that we had come home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, the church is God's kingdom, for here we are under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, as God's warrior we are fighting against His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are here for the Body, the new man, the Bride, the family, the kingdom, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A message given by Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California, February, 1973</S>
