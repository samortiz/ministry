BEING THE THIRD PRINCIPLE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The third principle for the building up of the church is that we cannot be individualistic in the Body of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ, and in the Body a member can never be individualistic. If we work individualistically, our work will tear down the church, not build it up. Furthermore, if our work causes others to be individualistic, our work will tear down the church, not build it up.</p>
<p>A believer should become more distinct when he lives in the Lord, is delivered from the self, and allows Christ to increase in him. However, being distinct from others is one thing, but being separate from others is another thing. As the element of Christ increases in us, we will become more distinct but not more separate from others. Instead, we will become more considerate of others, more accommodating of others, and more attached to others. I hope that we can discern the difference between these two conditions. It is normal to become more distinct because of the increase in the element of Christ in us. However, it is not normal to become more isolated and separate from others.</p>
<p>For example, when the Lord deals with a brother who is very talkative, the element of Christ will increase in him. Often such a brother will become restricted in his speech and not speak as carelessly as he spoke in the past. In all things he will accept the discipline of the Spirit, speaking only when the indwelling Spirit leads him to speak. Based on the lessons that he has learned, Christ will rule in him in regard to his speaking. Thus, in his speaking he will grow into Christ, and this growth will make him distinct from others.</p>
<p>This brother, however, may serve with a number of other saints who have not been broken in the matter of their speaking. When they come together, they will speak to one another carelessly, because they do not have much of the element of Christ in their speaking. When this brother is with these saints, there will be an obvious distinction between them. In spite of this distinction, however, the broken brother will not despise or condemn the saints, much less separate himself from them. The fact that his companions are talking nonsense will not affect him, and although he is distinct, he will not separate himself from them. In fact, he will attach himself even more to them because of the increased element of Christ in him. We must see that the church is the Body and that the Body cannot be divided. We cannot be divided from brothers who are weak. The weaker the brothers are, the more we should bear them up. We should not be isolated from others, and we should not do a work that is isolated from others.</p>
<p>If a brother has really learned the lesson of being dealt with in his speaking, he can serve and work with brothers who are quite talkative. However, as he helps the brothers, he should not work in a way that isolates them as a group from the saints. If he helps the other brothers to learn the lesson of receiving the Lord&rsquo;s dealing, he should be careful not to let a separate group be formed in a local church; this would be a work of separation. We should not be secluded from others, and our work should not foster seclusion. We should help others to learn to live in the Lord so that the element of Christ can increase in them. An increase in the element of Christ will result in a person manifesting distinctions in his expression of Christ, but it will also make him more accommodating, more considerate, and more attached to others.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, we should not do a work that causes the saints to be separate from others. We should never say, &ldquo;A small number of us have received the Lord&rsquo;s dealing in our speaking, and we love to be together in the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting. Those who speak carelessly can meet somewhere else; we do not want to meet with them.&rdquo; If we say this, we will tear down the church. You must learn to be patient, considerate of others, and accommodating, because the principle of the church, the principle of the Body, is oneness. This is the reason Paul asks, &ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:13). The Word never charges those who are stronger in the church to separate themselves from those who are weaker. In fact, Romans 14:1 says, &ldquo;Him who is weak in faith receive.&rdquo; No matter how much we have been dealt with and no matter how much our fellow serving ones lack the Lord&rsquo;s dealing, we must still sit together with them and pray with them.</p>
<p>What should we do if the brothers sitting around us are talking to each other when the bread-breaking meeting begins? Would we be able to participate in the bread-breaking meeting? Some brothers would not be able to, and instead, they would frown at the saints and move to a different chair. Although they do not leave the meeting, they would change their seat. If this is our reaction, it will not be possible for us to build up the church. If we have been dealt with by the Lord, we will be able to pray, &ldquo;Lord, praise You for giving me so many brothers.&rdquo; Rather than despising them, we will be considerate of them, knowing that we were once just as talkative. We will also have a deep realization that their lack of restraint is related only to their shortage of the element of Christ, and we will be full of compassion and mercy toward them. Furthermore, we will not feel that we are rich and others are poor, or that we are full of Christ and others are short of Christ. This kind of attitude is also not right.</p>
<p>No matter how many lessons we have learned and no matter how much Christ we have, we cannot disregard our brothers and sisters. No matter how much they care for themselves, how carelessly they speak, or how lacking they are of Christ, they are still our brothers and sisters. Since the Lord has received them, we must receive them and receive them from our heart. We must feel from our heart that we cannot be separated from our brothers and sisters, because we are in the church, the Body of Christ. No matter how much of Christ we have and how little of Christ they have, we have no reason to be separated from them.</p>
<p>We must learn this lesson. In the church we cannot be individualistic or isolated; neither can we do an individualistic work nor a work in isolation. A sister once said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I cannot visit people with a certain sister, because whenever we go, she always speaks first. As soon as she opens her mouth, she cannot stop speaking. I never have an opportunity to speak. I cannot visit people with her.&rdquo; Then I asked, &ldquo;What do you think should be done?&rdquo; She responded, &ldquo;It is best that she visits whomever she wants to visit and that I visit others. Since she likes to talk, she can go wherever she wants by herself.&rdquo; We should consider whether this sister&rsquo;s words are right and whether these sisters should continue to visit saints with each other; however, I think it would be better if they would visit the saints together.</p>
<p>A sister who has learned the lesson of being broken can coordinate with a sister who always rushes in and speaks first. When two sisters visit someone, for example, and one sister seems to cover everything in her speaking, the other sister will have no reason to be concerned if she has learned lessons before the Lord. A person&rsquo;s weightiness before the Lord cannot be hidden or suppressed. If she has something of the Lord, she has it, and if she does not have something of the Lord, she does not have it. Others will always sense what we have of the Lord; we do not have to say anything. A weighty sister can sit quietly without any anxiety and let the other sister speak freely. At the end she can spontaneously offer a little prayer. In effect, the endless talking of one sister only provides a blackboard for the other sister to write upon with her prayer. Thus, it is the quiet sister who is edifying the others. Even though she says hardly anything, her silence is more powerful than the other sister&rsquo;s speaking. Furthermore, the sister who is being visited will witness a weighty person who is able to sit without saying anything, who is without any anxiety, and who does not even change her countenance. Her calm and steady demeanor will edify the one who is being visited. We should never think that a talkative sister will ruin a visitation, and we should not think that only speaking could edify others.</p>
<p>If a sister thinks that she has learned the lesson of being broken and decides to visit by herself because the one with whom she is serving has not learned the same lessons, she will have problems. As soon as she arrives, she will be asked, &ldquo;Where is sister So-and-so? Did you not come together last time?&rdquo; Answering these questions will be difficult. The visiting sister cannot lie and say that the other sister is sick, and she also cannot say that she did not want the other sister to come because she talks too much. The expression on the visiting sister&rsquo;s face will expose the fact that the two sisters cannot coordinate with each other. The sister who is being visited may not know the details related to their inability to coordinate, but unconsciously she will be damaged. She will think, &ldquo;How can you come to visit me when you cannot coordinate with the other sister?&rdquo; This will leave a very poor impression in her.</p>
<p>Genuine work does not depend on how much we have said or how much we have done. All genuine work depends on what we are in our being, how much we have been broken in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, and how much we know concerning the church and the Body. Whether or not we are talkative does not matter. The only things that matter are the lessons we have learned, the attitude we have, the spirit we have, and the kind of person we are. If our situation is proper, we will be able to serve together and visit others with brothers and sisters who are talkative. Their talkativeness can even be a blackboard upon which we can convey the spiritual lessons we have learned. Hence, there is no need to be individualistic or to do an individualistic work.</p>
<p>An individualistic work is based on a demand that others be the same as we are; however, everyone is different. Whether in disposition, temperament, viewpoint, or opinion, no one can be exactly the same as we are. We become individualistic whenever we are unwilling to coordinate with others or be attached to others. We also produce individualistic members when we work to make others the same as we are. If our work is individualistic, our work will produce individualistic members who are separate from others. On the surface, it may seem as if we have edified others, but actually, we have torn down the church.</p>
<p>We should never have a goal to make others the same as we are. Our work is not to build up ourselves, nor to build up a group of people who are the same as we are. Our work is to build up the church, the Body of Christ. This is a crucial principle.</p>
<p>The best proof of whether or not a person or a work is individualistic is time. An individualistic worker or an individualistic work cannot stand the test of time. If we are individualistic and demand that others be the same as we are, those who are the same as we are will become different from the other saints over time. Requiring others to be the same as we are does not produce lasting results. We need to have the same mind, but such a mind is not maintained by requiring others to be same as we are. Being of the same mind comes from being in the church, not from having the same personal characteristics. I may have learned some lessons and by the Lord&rsquo;s grace can render some supply to others, but I should never ask others to adopt my personal characteristics. I should never use my personal characteristics as the center of our one accord. Our one accord rests in the church itself. Since all the brothers and sisters around me are in the church, I should be in one accord with them, blend with them, and serve with them, no matter how fleshly, weak, and short of Christ they seemingly are. Even though there may be a difference in the amount of our spiritual growth, this cannot be a reason for separating ourselves from them. If we see and keep this principle related to the building up of the church, our one accord and our work will bear the test of time.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_024.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_026.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Service for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 25</div><br></body></html>
