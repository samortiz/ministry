<h2 class="head2">Having Loved His Own Who Were in the World,<br />He Loved Them to the Uttermost</h2><p>The second part of verse 1 says, "Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost." If you do not love anyone in this world, you can allow many things to go unattended. If you have no relatives, friends, or children, you can die peacefully. But there were many whom the Lord loved. If I were close to death and I had many loved ones, the final thing that I would do would be to give them my will. This is what man would do, but this was not what the Lord did. He washed the disciples' feet. The Lord loved His own who were in the world, and He washed their feet. He could do a thousand other things, but He did not. Instead, He chose to wash the disciples' feet. He did this because of His love. This makes the foot-washing a very wonderful matter. If the Lord had not loved His own who were in the world, foot-washing would not have been so wonderful. But foot-washing is very wonderful because the Lord did this to those whom He loved. The Lord, having loved His own who were in the world, loved them to the uttermost. Therefore, He washed their feet. This is an expression of the Lord's uttermost love.</p><h2 class="head2">Satan Having Already Put into the Heart of Judas<br />the Thought to Betray Jesus</h2><p>Verse 2 says, "And while supper was taking place, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray Him." This was not a common occurrence. Here was a man who was going to betray the Lord, and the Lord knew this. He was facing a most difficult and critical situation. This is like a man who cannot leave his house even though he knows that it is going to collapse. Unlike many rich people in Shanghai, who give up their houses and move away when they collapse, he does not have any money and cannot move anywhere. What should he do? What would you do if there was a war in this place and the condition was critical? What would you do if you knew that danger was approaching in five minutes, that a bomb would fall or the enemy would arrive? Would you still be washing or shining your shoes? Of course not! We would not be doing insignificant things. Instead, we would be doing the most important things. During this critical juncture, the Lord washed the disciples' feet. What does this mean? Do you think that He was wrong to do this? Certainly not! Foot-washing must be a very important thing because it was done at the time when Judas was about to betray the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">The Father Having Given All<br />into the Lord's Hands</h2><p>Verse 3 says, "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all into His hands..." This refers to His exaltation, glory, power, honor, crown, and enthronement. The Lord knew that He was to receive all these things. If you knew that you were about to be exalted and would receive glory, power, and honor, what would you do? You would surely do something that prepared you for your exaltation. Perhaps you would refurnish your house to make room for guests and friends. You would do some crucial things that would match your new status. The Lord knew that He was about to depart from this world, and He knew that the Father had given all into His hands. Yet He washed the disciples' feet. This shows that foot-washing must be a very crucial thing in the eyes of the Lord. He Himself washed the disciples' feet, and He also charged the disciples to wash one another's feet. Hence, we must not pass by John 13 easily; we should not look at this chapter lightly.</p><p>Before coming to the subject, I wanted to first consider the background behind the foot-washing. We have seen that this act was done when the Lord was about to depart out of this world to the Father. The Lord loved His own who were in the world to the uttermost; He knew that there was danger before Him because Judas was about to betray Him. He also knew that the Father had given all into His hands. Against this background, the Lord washed the disciples' feet and charged them to wash one another's feet.</p>
