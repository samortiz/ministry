   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE WAY TO CONTACT THE LORD Scripture Reading: Rom 9:23; John 6:51; 7:37-38; 2 Cor 13:14; Matt 28:19; 1 Cor 15:45; John 20:22; 2 Cor 3:17; John 6:63 MAN CREATED AS A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s central thought and eternal intention is to work Himself into us to become life to us and even to become everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To accomplish this intention, God created man as a vessel Rom 9:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A vessel is made for the purpose of containing something.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was created, a vessel must be filled with something.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since man was created as a vessel, we need to consider what man was made to contain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With what was man meant to be filled?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Man was made to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are containers of God, and God must be our content.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why human beings often have a sense of emptiness within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We feel empty because we were made to contain God, and if we do not have God within us, we are merely empty vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why we need to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To believe in the Lord Jesus is not merely to believe that He is our Savior; to believe in the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into our spirit John 1:12; 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, God in Christ as the Spirit enters into our spirit and begins to dwell within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are containers, and the Triune God the Father in the Son as the Spirit is the content within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the content within us, the Triune God wants to fill us with Himself in order to become our life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are completely filled with God in this way, God will be our content, and we will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BEING FILLED WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BY EATING AND DRINKING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After we have believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him into us, we can be filled with Him by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord is the heavenly bread for us to feed upon and the living water for us to drink 6:51; 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Matthew 4:4 also tells us that we should not live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s word is the expression of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, to take in God s word is to take in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GOD BEING TRIUNE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SO THAT WE CAN PARTAKE OF HIM</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We who have believed in the Lord Jesus have the Lord dwelling within us Rom 8:10; 2 Cor 13:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since we have received the Lord into us, the question is, How do we partake of the Lord day by day and moment by moment as our food, drink, and life supply?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the question that we will address in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This question is mysterious, divine, heavenly, spiritual, and eternal, yet the answer is actually quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To understand the way for us to unceasingly partake of the Lord as our food, drink, and life supply, we must see that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible reveals that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 , yet this does not mean that there are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is only one God 1 Cor 8:4 , yet this one God is three the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can see the matter of the Triune God in Matthew 28:19, which says, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s charge to us is that we would disciple all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning those among the nations who receive the Lord, the Lord instructed us to baptize them into the name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord did not use the plural form of the word name, saying that we should baptize the nations into the names; instead, He used the singular form, name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The three of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit have one name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are three, yet They have only one name.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates clearly that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a limited way, water is a helpful illustration of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose we have a large piece of ice.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Ice is very solid.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose, however, that we leave the ice in the sun for an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we do this, after an hour the ice will melt and become water.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, suppose we leave the water outside for an entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do this, at the end of the day the water will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After a day in the sun, the water will turn into vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Over the course of the day, we will have ice, then water, and then vapor, but can we say that these are three different items?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot say this, because the ice, water, and vapor are the same substance in three distinct forms.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can apply this illustration to our partaking of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you have a large chunk of ice, it would be very difficult to take it into you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you allow the ice to melt and become water, it will be easier for you to take it in. If you allow the water to become vapor, it will be even easier to take it into you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When water becomes vapor, you can very easily breathe it into you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, we can say that in order for us to partake of the water, it has to pass through three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First, it is ice; second, it is water; and third, it is vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Similarly, our God has passed through a process of three steps in order to make Himself available for us to partake of Him and receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the first step God the Father is the fountain, the source, of the Divine Trinity cf.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Psa 36:9; Jer 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the second step God the Son is the embodiment and expression of the Triune God Col 2:9; John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Through incarnation the Son as the complete Triune God became flesh 1:1, 14 in order to bring God into man and to accomplish our redemption through His crucifixion on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the third step God the Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father 14:16-20, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In His resurrection the Son as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit to be the consummation of the processed Triune God 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is like water vapor, and we can breathe Him in John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 , our partaking of Him is not limited by time or space.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Wherever we are and whenever we desire, we can simply breathe Him in. All we need to do is to tune our heart and our spirit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I use the word tune because the Spirit can also be likened to the radio waves in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whenever we tune our heart and spirit to Him, we have the sense that we are being touched within.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Holy Spirit comes and touches our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We all need to have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we repent, confess our sins, sincerely turn our heart to the Lord, and believe in Him, we sense that we are being touched within and that something is moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is the moving of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Spirit is like the vapor in the illustration of the ice, the water, and the vapor.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In this regard, we can say that the Spirit is the last form of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is the consummation of the Triune God, and today it is easy for us to breathe Him in. When we tune our heart to Him, He comes into our spirit, and we have the sense that we have been touched within.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At times we even sense that there is a speaking within us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This speaking comes not from outside of us but from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This speaking is the divine visitation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God the Father comes to us in God the Son as God the Spirit.</S>
