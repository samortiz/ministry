   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose someone asks you what church you attend.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may answer that we do not take a certain name, but we just meet according to the city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This kind of answer may be ambiguous and confusing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The best way to answer is to avoid all the various involvements.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of question is usually asked by a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is best to simply say that we are not denominational.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We just meet in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After you have visited with him for some time, and it appears that he is a real seeker after the truth, you may be able to share more with him concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>DEALING WITH THOSE WHO HAVE A LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF SPIRITUAL MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With those who have a limited knowledge of spiritual matters, it is always good to center on the fact that God is real.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such a word calms all kinds of doubts and questions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is hard for anyone to say that God is not real or to say that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since God is real, we all have to consider what such a God has to do with us and what we have to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This kind of talk will lead others to realize that there are so many things in this universe which are far beyond our knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even medical doctors have to admit that there are many things about our human body which they do not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Another item we do not understand thoroughly is electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not have the capacity to know all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do know that God is here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is concerned with us, so we must be concerned with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE LORD'S FAR-REACHING SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Someone was asked whether a terrible criminal who has committed all kinds of crimes and has become demon possessed can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of case provides a good opportunity for us to preach the good tidings, the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament, two criminals were crucified with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While the Lord was on the cross, one of these criminals was saved by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is recorded in Luke 23.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a strong proof that a criminal can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regarding demon possession, we must learn not to be so demon conscious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such thinking is a deceit of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christians have to ignore the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wherever we go, the demons will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>BEING FREED FROM FORMALITY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Learn to be freed from formality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians must be those who are always singing, praising, and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we are not rejoicing, our minds will be soaring, but the best way to consolidate our soaring minds is to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then our minds will be concentrated, and the Lord will get the praise and the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How glorious if we come to all the meetings of the church in such a way!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you drop your formality when you go to visit people, you will not go as a pastor, a missionary, or a Bible student.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, your going will be in a normal way as a regular human being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way, your going will be so nice and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You must forget about your status.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not try to behave.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Just live.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To behave yourself in an outward way is hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just be what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While you are going to knock on doors, you should be singing and rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hymns, #717 is a good song for us to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The chorus of this hymn says:</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore, It is better to sing than be sighing: It is better to live than be dying; So let us rejoice evermore.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christians should be living creatures Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>1:5-25; Rev 4:6-8 .</S>
