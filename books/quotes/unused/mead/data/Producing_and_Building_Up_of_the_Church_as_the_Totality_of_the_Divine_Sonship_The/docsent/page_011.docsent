   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR REALIZING THE INDWELLING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17a; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22a; Eph 3:16-19</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is produced and built up by the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to consider all the aspects of Christ s work in the way of experience, not in a mere doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to see how the death of Christ accomplished many things for the producing of the church, how His resurrection brought forth the constituents of the church, and how His ascension brought all the believers into the heavens and furnished, afforded, and equipped every member of the Body of Christ to be able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we must also see the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The indwelling of Christ permeates the divine revelation of the entire New Testament, especially the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reality of the church life is nothing less than the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THROUGH REGENERATION OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BECOMING OUR NEW PERSON Man Being of Three Parts Spirit, Soul, and Body</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To consider the indwelling of Christ, not in a doctrinal way but in a very experiential way, we must see the real significance of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The man created by God is of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our physical body is outward, our spirit is inward, and our soul is between our body and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not mere spirits; we are persons with a material body composed of basic physical elements, which are the same elements as those in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Medical doctors cannot exhaust the study of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is marvelous and wonderful Psa 139:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, the Bible considers our body to be a house for our being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Strictly speaking, we dwell not in a house but in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because this house is temporary, it is considered a tabernacle, a tent 2 Cor 5:1-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is our body as our outward part.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our inward parts are even more marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have two hearts, a physical heart and an invisible, psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jeremiah 17:9 says, The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable; / Who can know it?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The deceitful and incurable heart referred to here is not the physical heart but the psychological heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our physical heart may be healthy, but our psychological heart is corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition to our heart, we have our mind, our mentality, which is part of our heart Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the psychological sense, we cannot see our mind, because it is more than just our physical brain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the mind we think, consider, understand, and perceive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While you are reading this chapter, you are using not only your eyes but even more your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without a mind we could see, but we could not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also have a will with which to make decisions and determinations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Again, it is impossible for us to locate our will, which is a part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We also have another faculty, our emotion, which is often indicated by the expressions on our face.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we are happy, we have a broad face, and when we are angry, we show a long face.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These expressions are directed not by our mind or our will but by our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our likes and dislikes, love and hate, and happiness and sorrow all come from our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Bible, the mind, will, and emotion are the components of the soul Psa 139:14; Job 7:15; S. S. 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Person of the Created Man</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Being His Soul, with the Body and</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>the Spirit as Its Organs</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The real human life of created man is not the physical life; it is the life in the soul, the soul-life, the life in the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Bible distinct Greek words are used to denote the physical life in the our body and the human life in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word denoting our physical life is bios, from which we derive the word biology .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only man but also all the animals have the bios life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this sense, our physical life is similar to that of the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The difference between us and the animals is that we have a higher life the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a person dies, for example, it is his animal life in his body that dies, not the human life in his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The human life in the soul is indicated by another Greek word, psuche, which is the root of the word psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Psuche refers both to the soul and to our human life, our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our human life is in our soul, and our soul-life is our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the Scriptures a human being is referred to as a soul Acts 2:41; 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A created human being as a soul has two basic organs.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The outward organ is the body with its five senses for contacting, touching, realizing, and substantiating the material world, and the inward organ is the spirit for contacting and substantiating God and the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We were created by God as a living soul with a body and a spirit as the organs Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Seeing this is very basic for our understanding of the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were born again in our spirit John 3:3, 6b .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Originally, we had the physical life in our body and the human life in our soul, but we did not have the divine life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since to be born is to receive a certain life, the fact that we were born of God the Spirit in our spirit is proof that another life came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now in our spirit we have the eternal, divine life, which is the life of God, God Himself as life to us Rom 8:10; Eph 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The word used in the New Testament to refer to the divine life is zoe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, as genuine Christians we have three lives: bios in our body, psuche in our soul, and zoe in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have the animal life, the human life, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The human life is higher than the animal life, and the divine life is higher than the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because we have three lives, we can be three kinds of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At times we can be divine, holy, bright, shining, heavenly, and spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At other times, however, we can be very human, sometimes good and pleasant in a natural way and sometimes sorrowful and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes we can even behave like an animal.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is our situation because we have three lives.</S>
