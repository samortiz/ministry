<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE UNIQUE WORK OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD<br>&#151;BUILDING HIMSELF INTO OUR BEING</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Sam. 7:11b-14a; John 14:23; Eph. 3:16-17; Matt. 13:3, 8, 23; Matt. 16:18; Rev. 21:2, 9-10, 12, 14, 22</H1><P>We thank the Lord that, throughout the years, He has opened His Word to us and has been speaking to us in His recovery. In this message I have the burden to help you to realize what is God's main work in His recovery, or in His economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S RECOVERY AND GOD'S ECONOMY</H2><P>The words recovery and economy refer to one thing as seen from two viewpoints. With God, it is a matter of economy; with us, it is a matter of recovery. God's economy was unveiled through the apostles, but because the believers lost the proper understanding of God's economy, there is the need for it to be recovered. Therefore, what is being recovered today is God's economy.</P><P>The Lord's recovery is also to recover the oneness of the Body. This means that in the recovery we must see the universal Body and do everything in the limitation, the regulation, of the one Body. We all need to learn how to practice the Lord's recovery of the one Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S UNIQUE WORK</H2><P>God's economy is centered on one thing&#151;God's unique work. God's unique work in the universe and throughout all the ages and generations is to work Himself in Christ into His chosen people, making Himself one with them. This involves the mingling of divinity with humanity.</P><P>In order to work Himself into us, God became a man and lived a human life on earth. Then He passed through death and entered into resurrection and ascension, becoming the consummated, life-giving Spirit ready to come into us. When He came into us, He regenerated our spirit. Now He is working in us to increase Himself in us and to build Himself into us.</P>
