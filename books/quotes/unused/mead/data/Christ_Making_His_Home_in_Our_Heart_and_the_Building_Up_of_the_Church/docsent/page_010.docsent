   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Obtaining the Life of God through the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean to be born of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a person believes in the Lord and confesses his sins, the Holy Spirit enters into him to enliven his human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His spirit is immediately enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First there is death, and then there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We pass from death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the way that we obtain a second life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the way God s life enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The life that we receive is resurrection life, which is able to raise us from death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are baptized, we do not remain in water to be buried there and never rise again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must realize that there is not only the ministry of John the Baptist but also the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John s ministry is a ministry of condemnation and death, but the ministry of the Lord Jesus is an enlivening ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a ministry unto life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord causes people to have life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the life of God enters into people, they are made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a person is baptized, on the one hand, he is baptized in water, which is a burial; on the other hand, he is raised up out of the water, which is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The old creation is buried, and the new creation is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is in Adam is buried, and what is in Christ is resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through this process of death and resurrection we are born again, and we obtain a second life the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without going through this process of death and resurrection, we can have only the human life, not God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is through believing and repenting that we receive this spiritual fact, and it is through our going into death that we can come out of death and have God s life in us, thereby having a second birth and a second life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to be born of water and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Water is for death, and the Spirit is for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being born of water means that we enter into water and are baptized in water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being born of the Spirit means that we are resurrected in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We receive life through death, and this is also to be born of water and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ENTERING INTO GOD S KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THROUGH REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once we are regenerated, we have two lives: God s life is added to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are in God s kingdom, and we know the things of God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The word kingdom does not refer merely to a sphere of authority, but even more, it refers to a realm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For instance, there is an animal world and a plant world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Animals know the things in the animal world and do not know the things in the plant world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Likewise, plants know the things in the plant world and do not know the things in the animal world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Birds occupy one section of the animal world, and they know the things in that section.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Birds do not know the things in the dog section, the cat section, or the cattle section.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Similarly, mankind also has its own world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The human world is the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man has the human life and therefore knows the things in the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, God is also a world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If man wants to understand the things in God s realm and be able to submit to the authority in God s kingdom, man must have God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we have God s life, we are in God s world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Spontaneously, we know the things in God s world, and we can see the things in God s world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the result of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>OBTAINING A SPIRITUAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THROUGH REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through regeneration we have God s life, are in God s world, know the things in God s world, and can submit to the authority of God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The life that we obtain through regeneration is not a life of the flesh; it is a spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, in John 3:6 the Lord said, That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to be born from his mother s womb a second time, but the Lord Jesus said that not only was Nicodemus unable to be born again from his mother s womb, but that even if he were able to enter into his mother s womb and be born again, he would still be born of the flesh and would still be flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since he was born of the flesh, he had only the natural life; that is, he had man s original life, which is now a corrupt life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No matter how many times one could be born of the flesh, his life would still be a corrupt life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be regenerated is to be born not of the flesh but of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>NEEDING TO CONTACT GOD WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Man has a body and a spirit deep within him, and between the body and the spirit is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We often confuse the spirit with the soul, but our spirit is different from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Regeneration means that we are born of the Spirit; we are born not in the flesh nor in the soul but in the spirit, which is the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is Spirit, and the words that He speaks to us are also spirit 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Since God is Spirit, those who worship Him must worship in spirit 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we want to contact God, we must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot touch God with our hands nor see God with our eyes nor smell God with our nose.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We cannot use any of the sense organs in our physical body to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Which organ do you use to differentiate the color white from green?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you close your eyes and use your ears, which are for hearing, you will not be able to tell whether a color is white or green.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you close your eyes, you cannot use your ears to hear a color or differentiate any colors.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nevertheless, you cannot say that there are no colors.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not that there are no colors, but that you are using the wrong organ and hence cannot discern colors.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You know when someone is speaking, because you have ears, and you use your ears to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You use your eyes to see, but are you able to see sounds?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although there are sounds, they cannot be seen with your eyes; they can be heard only with your ears.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If you use the wrong organ, your ability to touch or sense will be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God is Spirit, and we must worship Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We cannot worship God with our ears, eyes, nose, or hands.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must worship Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we pray, we usually go to a quiet place and close our eyes, because our whole being needs to be calm.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>All our physical organs need to be brought to a stop so that we can use our inner organ, our spirit, to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We do not contact God and worship Him according to our thoughts, views, feelings, or preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the contrary, we need to stop all these faculties, calm ourselves down, and turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only then can we contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God is Spirit; therefore, we must contact Him with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We cannot see God with our eyes, and we are unable to hear Him with our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, if we calm down and use our spirit, if we turn to our spirit to draw near to God and contact Him, immediately we will sense something in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We will sense that our spirit is bright.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There will also be some activity in our spirit that causes us to sense that this or that matter is wrong, or that we should love and cherish others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The fact that there is such activity in us means that God is touching us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When God s Spirit touches our spirit, we become enlivened within.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>THE HOLY SPIRIT MOTIVATING</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>AND OPERATING IN MAN LIKE THE WIND</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The regenerated life inside of us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This Spirit is invisible and intangible.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord Jesus said that the Spirit is like the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Spirit is like the wind and can be very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Every year in Hong Kong, around August or September, there is a strong wind.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Sometimes a ship is even blown onto the shore.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But have you seen the wind?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You may say that you have not seen the wind, but it seems that you have seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The wind comes with power and with a manifestation that causes us to recognize that there is wind.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Sometimes when we are walking on the street, the wind blows so strongly that it becomes difficult for us to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Sometimes the wind blows faster than a car can move.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The wind blows where it wills; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Although we cannot see or touch the Spirit, He is blowing in us, and sometimes He causes us to be beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>For this reason, people often say that those who believe in Jesus are not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is true.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>How can a ship that is blown onto the shore be normal?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>How can a person who is being pushed by the wind be normal?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God operating in us is like the wind blowing on us.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>On the day of Pentecost, the place where the disciples gathered was filled with the wind.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>A violent wind came and blew upon Peter and John, making them look like they were drunk with wine; they were crazy and fearless Acts 2:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is the result of being born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>This is a spiritual birth.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is man obtaining the eternal life of God within him.</S>
