[6]  One is His perfect will, and the other is His permissive will.
[7]  CHAPTER EIGHTY-SEVEN THE PRAYER THAT EXPRESSES GOD'S WILL Scripture Reading: Matt 6:9-13 WHAT IS PRAYER?
[8]  Second, He puts this purpose within man through the Holy Spirit so that man feels this need as well.
[9]  Following this there are three things that we have to ask for: "Your name be sanctified," "Your kingdom come," "Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth."
[10]  The verses above show us that God has an eternal plan Eph 3:11 .
[11]  God's eternal will is that all things in the heavens and on earth be headed up in Christ v. 10 . In other words, Christ is to be the Head over all things.
[12]  The Lord is the Son of God as well as the Christ of God.
[13]  His title as the Son also denotes that He is equal with God and shares the same glory as God.
[14]  God created the angels with a free will, and God also created man with a free will.
[15]  If the angels and man had been created without a free will, the Son would not be able to gain any glory, because anything which is dead has no meaning.
[16]  If the angels and man, who were endowed with a free will, had allowed the Son to be the Head, the Son would have gained the glory.
[17]  Isaiah 14:12-20 also gives us some facts about Satan.
[18]  Verses 12 through 14 describe his past, while verses 15 through 20 tell us his present condition.
[19]  Genesis 1:28 tells us that after God created man, He blessed him and told him to be "fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion" over all things.
[20]  On the one hand, God wants to deal with death by life through man's multiplication, and on the other hand, God gave Adam the authority to have dominion.
[21]  This position and authority once belonged to Satan, but now God has replaced him with man.
[22]  Genesis 2:15 says, "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
[23]  Hebrews 2:5-10 quotes Psalm 8; it is also an exposition of Psalm 8.
[24]  Verse 5 says, "For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth."
[25]  God has not given the coming inhabited earth, which is the millennium, to the angels but to man.
[26]  CHAPTER NINETY-TWO THE FALL OF MAN Scripture Reading: Gen 3
[27]  As far as God's eternal will is concerned, His goal is centered on Christ, but as far as His permissive will is concerned, His goal is centered on man.
[28]  God has His eyes on man and He gains man so that He can deal with His enemy through man.
[29]  We have mentioned before that God's eternal plan is for Christ to be glorified and to be made the Head over all things.
[30]  When Satan rebelled and man fell, God had to come in to deal with these two problems before He could accomplish His eternal plan.
[31]  Originally God created man with the purpose of having man deal with the rebellious Satan and to displace his rule.
[32]  The center of God is Christ, whereas the center of Christ is the cross.
[33]  When the Lord became a man, He became a representative of all men and included all men.
[34]  Because He included all men, all men suffered God's punishment when He was crucified on the cross and shed His blood 2 Cor 5:14 .
[35]  Ephesians 1:20-22 says, "Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church."
[36]  OF SATAN'S KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Col 1:13; Acts 26:18; 2 Cor 2:11; Matt 12:25-26
[37]  These few verses show us that Satan has a kingdom.
[38]  They are not in the air but on earth.
[39]  Its position is that of being joined to Christ, and its responsibility is to continue the warfare that Christ fought on earth.
[40]  The church, as the Body of Christ, is His propagation, continuing His stand and work to fight against God's enemy.
[41]  THE CHURCH CARRYING OUT GOD'S WILL ON EARTH Subduing the Rulers and Authorities
[42]  The church has a great responsibility on the earth today.
[43]  On the negative side, the church has to subdue the power of darkness and continue the warfare that Christ waged against Satan.
[44]  THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST CHAPTER NINETY-SIX THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:4-6; John 12:32; Luke 12:50-52 THE MYSTERY HIDDEN IN THE AGES
[45]  In Ephesians 3:4-6 Paul speaks of his understanding of the mystery of Christ.
[46]  The men of old did not know of the mystery that God spoke through Paul, which involves the Jews and Gentiles becoming one new man in Christ Jesus.
[47]  Ephesians 1 speaks of the church as the Body of Christ; chapter two speaks of the church as the new man; chapter three speaks of the mystery of Christ; chapter four speaks of the way to build up the Body of Christ; chapter five speaks of the responsibility of the church; and chapter six speaks of the warfare of the church.
[48]  In this message we will speak on the Body of Christ.
[49]  In the New Testament, Paul was the only apostle who used the expression the Body of Christ to denote the church.
[50]  In other places in the New Testament, the church is called the temple of God, the household of God, etc. But Paul specifically said that the church is the Body of Christ.
[51]  We are talking about how the church becomes the Body of Christ.
[52]  Even if we have all the knowledge there is about the Body of Christ, we still may not have seen the Body of Christ or touched the reality of the Body.
[53]  BEING A BELIEVER AND BEING A MEMBER Scripture Reading: Eph 3:3-6; 4:15-16; Col 3:10-11; Rom 12:4-5; 1 Cor 12:4-16, 20, 26
[54]  In the last two messages we saw that the church is the corporate Christ, and we saw also that in order to know the Body of Christ, we have to deal with our natural life.
[55]  The Body of Christ is the continuation of Christ's life on earth.
[56]  The Word of God does not say the church is like the Body of Christ; it says the church is the Body of Christ.
[57]  The New Testament shows us that there is a difference between being a member and being a Christian.
[58]  Only a revelation from God will usher us into the realm of the Body, and only then will the Body of Christ become our experience.
[59]  CHAPTER NINETY-NINE THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 3:3-6; 2:15; Col 3:10-11; 1 Cor 12:20-21; Rom 12:3-6 THE NEED FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY
[60]  Every Christian should know that he is only a member.
[61]  If he does not have the other members, he will not survive.
[62]  In the Body all the members must be joined together before they can become the Body.
[63]  We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ.
[64]  This Body renders supply to every member of the Body.
[65]  If you are simply a believer, you can act as you please, but if you are a member of the Body, then you must allow yourself to be limited by the other members.
[66]  The cross leads to the Body, and the cross operates in the sphere of the Body.
[67]  Then we will see that we are members of the Body of Christ, that we need the protection and limitation of the Body, and that we need to function in the Body and supply other members so that the life of the Body will flow in an unhindered way.
[68]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ONE AUTHORITY IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22; 2:15; 3:3-6; 4:15-16; Col 2:19; 3:10-11 THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY RESTING IN THE HEAD
[69]  The Bible emphatically tells us that Christ is the Head.
[70]  One day God will head up everything in the universe under Christ.
[71]  Today the universe has not come under the headship of Christ yet, and everything is in a state of confusion.
[72]  God ordained that Christ should exercise headship over all things, but today that headship must first be exercised in the church, and then through the church the headship will be exercised over all things.
[73]  Paul spoke of "holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God" Col 2:19 .
[74]  Since Christ is the Head of the Body, we have to hold the Head.
[75]  Holding the Head is acknowledging that only Christ is the Head; it is coming absolutely under His authority.
[76]  The members of the Body are fitted together and able to live the Body life through holding the Head.
[77]  Unless we recognize the headship of Christ in the Body, we will never have a perfect fellowship with the other members, because it is our common relationship to Him that causes us to be related to one another.
[78]  The Bible shows us that God's anointing is only for the One who has totally satisfied God's heart His Son, Christ.
[79]  If this is so, why does the Body receive the anointing?
[80]  Because the Head is Christ, the Anointed One, the Body is also Christ.
[81]  In the Bible the Holy Spirit is symbolized by many things, such as the wind, the living water, and the fire.
[82]  At the same time, the Holy Spirit is also life, power, etc. However, 1 John 2:27 is particularly sweet in its description of the Holy Spirit as the anointing.
[83]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THREE THE ORDER OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3-8; Eph 4:9-16; Col 2:19; 1 Cor 11:29 THE MINISTRY OF THE MEMBERS
[84]  First Corinthians 12:18 says, "But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed."
[85]  This shows that every member has a definite place, definite assignment, and definite position.
[86]  Every member has a particular portion with which he serves the Body of Christ.
[87]  Therefore, we have to seek revelation and experience from Christ so that we can have something to supply the Body, and we have to know the order of the Body, which is God's assigned pattern in the Body.
[88]  Ephesians 4:11 speaks of a group of people who are for the Body; they are God's gifts to the church, supplying Christ for the building up of the Body.
[89]  The apostles are the first gift that God has appointed in the Body of Christ.
[90]  Instead, he referred the matter to God, who made it clear that touching the anointed of the Lord was the same as touching the Lord Himself, and that repudiating the authority of His prophet was the same as repudiating His authority.
[91]  God requires us to come directly under not only the authority of the Lord but also the authority of those who represent His authority in the Body.
[92]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOUR THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: Acts 6:6; 8:4-5, 12, 14-17; 9:3-6, 10-12, 17; 19:6; James 5:14-16; Matt 18:15-16, 19-20; 1 Tim 4:14; 5:22; 2 Tim 1:6 THE APOSTLES' LAYING ON OF HANDS
[93]  There is an example in Acts 8 that shows us the principle of the Body.
[94]  At that time the church in Jerusalem suffered great persecution, and except for the apostles, all the disciples were dispersed.
[95]  In James 5:14-16 we see the laying on of hands in relation to sickness.
[96]  In the case of sickness we are instructed by James to call for the elders of the church.
[97]  The elders, rather than the members of the church who have the gift of healing, need to be called because the sick persons in this case need to be brought under the anointing; their case must be dealt with by the representatives of the church.
[98]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIVE THE RICHES IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: Deut 32:30; Psa 133; Eph 1:23; 2:20-22; 3:10, 18-19; 4:13; 6:11; 1 Cor 12:27; Matt 18:15-18 THE MEASURE OF CHRIST
[99]  He is the Lord who fills all in all Eph 1:23 .
[100]  When Paul wrote to a group of believers in Corinth, he said, "Now you are the body of Christ" 1 Cor 12:27 .
[101]  The Body of Christ is not only universal; it is also local.
[102]  Every local church is the manifestation of the Body of Christ in that locality.
[103]  The Body of Christ is not something abstract or unfathomable; the Body of Christ is manifested in the local churches.
[104]  The local church, being the local expression of the Body of Christ, has the headship of Christ and, therefore, can know the mind of Christ, which is always communicated to His Body.
[105]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX THE MINISTRY IN THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:4-31 SEEING THE REVELATION
[106]  A Christian must see not only that he is a believer but also that he is a member of the Body.
[107]  What we minister to the Body is Christ, and what the Body receives is Christ, because Christ is all and in all in the Body.
[108]  Our service in the Body of Christ is based on our knowledge of Christ.
[109]  This knowledge comes from our experience of life, not from doctrines.
[110]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHT THE POWER OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE NOT WILL POWER BUT LIFE POWER
[111]  A Christian does not live by the power of his will but by the power of life.
[112]  Many Christians have never seen this, nor have they learned this lesson.
[113]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINE THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:12; Gen 12:11-13; Luke 20:1-8; John 6:38
[114]  Prayer: Lord, shine on us so that we will be honest enough to acknowledge what we have and what we do not have.
[115]  We do not want to be empty inwardly while pretending to have something outwardly.
[116]  Paul testified in 2 Corinthians 1:12 that "our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you."
[117]  The principle of Christian living is based not on natural disposition but on God's own nature.
[118]  The Lord then said, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things" v. 8 . The Lord did not say that He did not know; He said that He would not tell them by what authority He did these things.
[119]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TEN BEING WEAK IN THE LORD Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 13:4; 12:9-10; 1 Cor 2:2-5 HINDRANCES TO SPIRITUAL GROWTH
[120]  Many Christians have problems and are not growing because they are not weak enough in the eyes of God.
[121]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN LOVING NOT OUR OWN LIFE
[122]  FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MANY SICKNESSES Date: December 6, 1939
[123]  The book of Revelation tells us that the brothers overcome Satan, the accuser, by the blood of Christ, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul-life.
[124]  When the son of the Shunammite woman died, the woman did not stay with the son but put him down and turned to Elisha 2 Kings 4:17-37 .
[125]  The book of Hebrews says that she received her dead by resurrection 11:35 .
[126]  But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God" Acts 20:23-24 .
[127]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWELVE GOD'S LIGHT AND SELF-ANALYSIS Scripture Reading: Heb 4:12; Psa 139:23-24; 119:130; Eph 5:13; John 1:4; Gen 32:30 SELF-ANALYSIS BEING A SPIRITUAL SICKNESS
[128]  In the course of their pursuit of the Lord, many Christians fall into the sickness of self-analysis.
[129]  They want to know what God's will is and what God's will is not.
[130]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN THE WARFARE OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9; Heb 2:14; Rom 8:13, 6; 2 Tim 1:10; 1 Cor 15:21-22, 25-26, 54-55; Matt 25:34, 46b; 7:14
[131]  The heaven and earth that God first created was committed to the archangel.
[132]  Later, the archangel fell and became Satan, and God came in to re-create the world.
[133]  A man can be free from sin, but he cannot be free from the satanic operation of death.
[134]  Romans 8 says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die" v. 13 , and "the mind set on the flesh is death" v. 6 . The death spoken of in these two verses is not the death of the body nor the death of hell but spiritual death.
[135]  OF 1940 CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THE ATTACK ON THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Acts 2:26-27, 31; 1 Cor 15:55; Rev 1:18; 20:13-14; Isa 38:9-11, 18; Eph 1:23; Col 2:9; Rom 8:10; 1 Cor 2:14 THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH
[136]  When Christ was living on earth, He was a vessel for the life of God.
[137]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THE WILL AND THE LAW OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 6:27-30; Rom 7:18-19, 21-25a; 8:1-4; Matthew 6 is on the physical life; Romans 8 is on the spiritual life.
[138]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN A FORETASTE OF THE POWERS
[139]  OF THE AGE TO COME Scripture Reading: Heb 1:13; 2:5, 7-8; 4:9; 6:5; 8:8-12; Matt 5:3; 11:28; 12:29; 16:18; 26:29; Luke 10:18-19; 11:20; 18:30; John 6:47; Ezek.
[140]  36:26-27; Jer 31:31-34; Rom 6:5; Zech 13:1; Joel 2:28-32; Acts 2:16-18; 1 Pet 1:5; Eph 2:8a; 2 Tim 1:10; 1 Cor 15:55; Rev 11:15; 12:9; 20:1-2, 4-5, 14a; Col 1:13 THE POWERS OF THE AGE TO COME God's Riches
[141]  Revelation 20 speaks of both death and Hades being cast into the lake of fire.
[142]  However, Matthew 16:18 says that the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church.
[143]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN OBSESSION AND LIGHT Scripture Reading: Psa 36:9; Isa 5:20; 50:10-11; Matt 5:37; 2 Thes 2:10b-12 OBSESSION IN THE BELIEVERS
[144]  It is possible for believers to be obsessed, and it is pitiful when believers are obsessed.
[145]  THE LIGHT OF GOD Scripture Reading: Isa 6:9-10; John 3:19-21; Matt 6:21-23; Psa 36:9; Prov 23:23; 2 Thes 2:10b-12; Acts 7:60b; 9:1-2; Phil 3:6a; 1 John 1:8 POSSESSION, OBSESSION, AND LIES
[146]  When a person is possessed, he falls directly into Satan's hand and is controlled and bound by Satan.
[147]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THE SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION AND CAUSES FOR OBSESSION Scripture Reading: Eph 4:18a; 2 Cor 10:3-5; John 3:19-21; 7:17; 5:19, 40-43; 2 Thes 2:10-11; Obad.
[148]  Darkness is something general, while light is something very definite.
[149]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY A PROPER PERSON IN GOD'S WORD Scripture Reading: Gen 49:18; John 12:27-28; Rom 1:25; 9:5; 11:33-36; Eph 1:2-3; 3:21; 6:23-24
[150]  All Scripture is God-breathed, but not all of the words in it are spoken by God.
[151]  Some are spoken by Satan, some are spoken by men, and some are spoken by men possessed with demons.
[152]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE GOD'S TWO FIRM FOUNDATIONS Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 2:19-21
[153]  The verses above show us that the Lord never changes and the things He accomplishes also never change.
[154]  Everything around us is changing, but there are two things which do not change.
[155]  CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO WINE MINGLED WITH GALL Place: Unrecorded
[156]  Scripture Reading: Matt 5:39-41, 44; 27:33-35; Luke 23:33-34; Acts 7:54-60; Rom 12:14, 20; 1 Cor 4:8-16; 11:16-29
[157]  Before the Lord was crucified on the cross and the soldiers divided his garments, He was scourged before the Jews and Gentiles and judged by the rulers.
[158]  The Lord's word on the cross was a prayer for His enemies.
[159]  When we know that it is no longer we who live but Christ and that we live by the faith of the Son of God in us, we find that there are no repercussions because He receives the blows, not us.
[160]  Prayer: Lord, under Your light we feel ashamed, because even though we are surrounded by riches, we are living in poverty.
[161]  Show us the riches that are found in Christ, and that we are made to partake of these riches through the grace of God.
[162]  In 1927 I was in the upper room in Wen-teh Lane, and the Lord showed me that my crucifixion with Christ was an accomplished fact.
[163]  Before that time I acknowledged the teaching of our crucifixion with Christ as much as anyone else.
