   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEETING FOR THE ASCENDED CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To meet with Christ, we need to breathe in Christ as life, but to meet for Christ, we need the rushing mighty wind to blow upon us Acts 2:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To meet for the ascended Christ we need power to demonstrate that the One whom we serve is now in the heavens and has been made Lord and Christ Acts 2:33-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to declare this to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the second kind of Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our meetings sometimes need to be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We meet not only with the resurrected Christ, but also for the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our Gospel meeting must be a meeting for the ascended Christ, declaring to the universe that the very Jesus whom the world has rejected has been made Lord and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is with us and He is within us, but for the unbelievers He is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Matthew and John tell us to meet with Christ; Mark, Luke, and Acts tell us to meet for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need the breathing, and we also need the blowing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need the breathing of the air for life and the blowing of the mighty wind for power.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For these two kinds of meetings we must pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the resurrection the disciples were in Jerusalem: they were frightened, they were under threatening and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was the price they had to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were Galileans; yet they stayed in Jerusalem in an atmosphere of fierce opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They paid a price.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then at a certain time the Lord Jesus told them to go to a mountain in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I were Peter, I would have asked, Lord, why must You ask us to go to a mountain in Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have a large guest room.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If You could meet with us here with all the doors shut, why could You not do the same there in Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why must we go to a mountain?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it is not up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He says to go up to the mountain, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should say, Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To say this, however, is easy, but to go up is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If I decided that we should all go up to the mountain tomorrow, I think that all the sisters would leave me first, saying that I do not care for the children.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the Lord Jesus said, Go to the mountain, and they did.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the Lord Jesus again took the lead and went back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why did He not ascend into the heavens from the mountain in Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Why must He go back to the Mount of Olives for His ascension?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is quite interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This involves much of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Firstly, it involves His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Two angels told the disciples, Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven Acts 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Zechariah 14:4 tells us that Jesus will come the second time upon the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So His ascension from this mount has to do with His coming back and His administration in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not a secret matter, but something official, something governmental.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had to ascend from the Mount of Olives; therefore He asked all His disciples to go from Galilee to Jerusalem to see Him off.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After they should do this, He requested them to tarry in Jerusalem, informing them that something would happen on this earth for His administration, for God s economy, for God s governmental activity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This could never be done in Galilee; it must be done in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must realize that Peter and all the others were not men of wealth, but poor fishers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How could they afford to go so far and stay so long in addition to being in a situation of threatening and persecution?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But that was the price they were called upon to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning the meetings after the resurrection or ascension, we can never discover any sense of lightness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every meeting was so weighty, quite unlike the meetings of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>People say today, Let us go to the eleven o clock Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been working so hard during the week Sunday morning is the best time for us to sleep in. What I mean is this: if we take the Lord s way to meet, we must meet at a cost, we must pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am so happy to tell the universe that here in Los Angeles there are many dear ones who have come from a distance just for the purpose of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So many have settled here and gotten jobs, but their main purpose is not to get settled and find jobs, but to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is really good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is a reason why we enjoy the Lord s presence so richly here.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So many have really paid the price to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have full assurance that many migrating from here to spread the church life to other cities will be greatly blessed with the Lord s abundant presence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are willing to sell their homes, give up their jobs, forget about their future and social welfare, and go at a cost to spread the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, we must be here not for our business, not for our schooling, not for our families, but for the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are the meeting people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We would like to pay any price to keep up the standard of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We would rather lose our jobs than lose the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some say that our meetings are too frequent and ask how the mothers can properly care for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But I have no word to say.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It all depends upon what is more precious and worthwhile in your lives.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the church is more precious than your children, you know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If your children are more precious than the Lord Jesus and His church, you also know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no need for me to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we really mean business for the church, we must realize that the church is in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To be here for the church means to be here for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do not care for the passing things of today; we care for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are looking for the eternal consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our certified public Accountant is in the heavens working out our account for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whatever we make in this world as a profit means nothing eventually that will be a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The heavenly, eternal C.P.A. will say, Sorry, your account shows a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You feel that you ve done well; you have been making a lot of money, but you lose.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What are we here for?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Look at Jesus and all His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Consider the way they met and how they were willing to pay any price to maintain good meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all have to meet with the resurrected Christ and for the ascended Christ, and we must be willing to pay the price to keep these kinds of meetings.</S>
