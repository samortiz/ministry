   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are different ways for possessed believers to obtain the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some have been bound so tightly that they have lost their freedom in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a result, this causes them to wake up and realize the truth about themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some believers obtain the truth because they realize that even though ninety-nine percent of their experience seems to come from God, there is still a tiny portion of wrong elements mixed in. This raises their suspicion and causes them to doubt if their experience is really from God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through this they understand the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some obtain the truth when other believers preach the truth to them and enlighten them concerning the real fact.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In whatever way a believer obtains the truth, he should never refuse the first ray of light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Doubting is the first step to acquiring the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not to doubt the Holy Spirit or to doubt God and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is to doubt our own past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This doubt is necessary and even scriptural because God wants us to prove the spirits 1 John 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we believe in something, there is no need to test it; if we have to test it, this means that we cannot decide for certain where it comes from.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We often have the wrong idea that this kind of testing may offend the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not realize that the Holy Spirit wants us to make such tests.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If something is of the Holy Spirit, it will still be of the Holy Spirit even though it is tested.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If it is of evil spirits, it will be exposed as a counterfeit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Has God caused you to fall into your present position?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Can there be contradictions in the work of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is it possible that you never make any mistakes in all that you do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a believer receives a little light from the truth, he will admit that it is very possible that he can be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This gives the truth a chance to work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The biggest mistake that a believer can make is to think that he can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Someone else can be wrong, but he can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This will cause him to be deceived to the end. But after he humbles himself, he will see that he has been deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he compares the principle of God's work with the condition of the evil spirits' work, he will see that his past experiences were all received in passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He fulfilled the condition of the work of evil spirits, and the result was many strange experiences; in the beginning they made him happy, but later they brought him sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When he makes a comparison between his past attitude, the principle of God's work, and the condition of the evil spirits' work, he will find that he was not actively co-working with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, he was just trying to passively follow God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, all of his wonderful or frustrating experiences must have come from evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then he will admit that he was deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A believer must not only receive the truth, he must also acknowledge it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only by acknowledging the truth are Satan's lies eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A believer's experience should be according to the following steps: 1 he should believe that it is possible for a believer to be deceived; 2 he should particularly believe that it is possible for him to be deceived; 3 he should acknowledge that he is indeed deceived; and 4 then he should go on to ask why he is deceived.</S>
