   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING REPLACING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord's table meeting is a replacement of the Feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, when the Lord set up His table, He and His disciples were attending the Passover feast.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the custom of the Jewish Passover, they surely partook of the bread and the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, the table meeting set up by the Lord was somewhat transitory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord and the disciples first ate the passover Matt 26:20-25; Luke 22:14-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then the Lord established His table with the bread and the cup Matt 26:26-28; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor 11:23-26 to replace the Feast of the Passover because He was going to fulfill the type and be the real Passover to us 1 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Luke 22 shows us that there were two kinds of eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One was a part of the Passover vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>15-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The other was a part of the Lord's table vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today we are at the Lord's table without any kind of transitory element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>PRAISING THE LORD WITH THE HYMNS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the Lord's table we should not pray by asking the Lord to do things for us, but we surely need to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To praise requires much exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to learn how to praise the Lord after we sing a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may merely shout, declare, and quote things from the hymnal in a mechanical way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if the saints are richer and stronger, they will not need to merely quote the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They will praise the Lord with the thought of the hymn, recomposing some of the terms and phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to learn how to digest a hymn in our praise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of digestion of a hymn is more living and informal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Lord's table meeting, there needs to be more praise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead of praising, the saints may merely read from the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They must learn to go beyond merely reading a hymn to digesting a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead of merely reading, "Oh, what a joy!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Oh, what a rest!"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hymns, #499 , we can say, "O Lord, in Your life we enjoy the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What a rest we enjoy!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can digest the terms in a hymn and make them a living praise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE LORD'S TABLE IN ANCIENT TIMES</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the ancient times the believers had a custom of coming together for supper, the main meal of the day, with the rich bringing more and better food for the mutual enjoyment and the poor, less food 1 Cor 11:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was called a love feast 2 Pet 2:13; Jude 12 , and it came from the background of the Passover feast Luke 22:13-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the end of their love feast they ate the Lord's supper with the bread and the cup to remember the Lord 1 Cor 11:23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the best way to have the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE CRUCIAL POINT IN OUR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to be deeply impressed that the crucial point in our service to the Lord is life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Life is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we help the saints get on the track of life, all the details of our practice will be spontaneously regulated by life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need some regulation and regulation helps.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But we need to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are not for a certain regulated situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A situation that is fully regulated can become like Forest Lawn Cemetery, a situation of death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Nee took the lead to practice the truth with life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must make it clear to the saints that we are not for the regulations but for life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the saints grow in life adequately, spontaneously they will be regulated.</S>
