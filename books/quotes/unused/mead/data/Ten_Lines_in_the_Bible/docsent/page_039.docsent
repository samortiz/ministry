   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE LINE OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible is not merely a book about God; it is also a book about man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If God and the Lord Jesus were taken away from the Bible, the Bible would become an empty book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the same way, if man was removed from the Bible, the Bible would have no one to receive God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, just as God and the Lord Jesus occupy a particular place in the Bible, man also occupies a particular place.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible reveals God and the Lord Jesus in order to show forth man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The essential object of God s revealing of Himself is man; therefore, man occupies a very significant place in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the entire Bible, man probably takes up a greater number of pages than God and the Lord Jesus, because a greater part of the words written in the Bible deal with the things concerning man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible plainly and clearly reveals the whole story of man in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we really want to know man, there is no way other than to read the Bible carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is because no other book in the entire world has ever described man s condition as thoroughly as the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, if we want to know the Bible, we also have to know the line of man in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible there are different groups of people, and God speaks differently to each group.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, some words are spoken to the children of Israel, so we should not apply them to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some words are spoken to the church, so we should not apply them to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every speaking has a particular group of people as its focus, and if we make a mistake in recognizing the object of a particular speaking, we will have a great problem in applying it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, when we read the Bible, we must pay attention to the line of man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I. THE ADAMIC RACE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Genesis 1:1 8:19 concerns the adamic race, Adam and his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To speak about the adamic race is to speak about the first group of people in the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this period all human beings in the world were of the adamic race; there was no distinction among Israelites, Gentiles, or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning the first group of people, there are five main points that require our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A. Created</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need to read Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Adam was created in God s image with a spirit, a soul, and a body, prepared to receive God s life and reign for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. Fallen</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Adam fell not long after he was created.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. God Coming to Seek and to Save</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the account in Genesis 3, as soon as Adam fell, he hid himself and was afraid to see God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, God came to seek and to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, God promised that the seed of the woman would come to be his Savior; on the other hand, God made coats of skins for him; this was done in anticipation of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>D. Rejecting the Way of Salvation,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Making a Living for Themselves,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>and Becoming Wicked to the Extreme</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Beginning with Cain, the majority of the people in the adamic race rejected God s way of salvation; they tried to make a living and invented a culture for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, they became wicked in the extreme and corrupt to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a consequence, they incurred God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>E. God Coming to Judge</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>and Destroy by the Flood, and</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only a Family of Eight Being Saved</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God then submerged the whole earth with the flood; all the people were destroyed by the flood except for Noah s family of eight.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At this point the adamic race came to an end. This was the first group of people in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE DESCENDANTS OF NOAH</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The descendants of Noah are recorded in Genesis 8:20 11:9.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Noah s descendants are the second group of people in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although God terminated the adamic race with the flood, He rescued Noah and his family of eight.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God established Noah as a new father, and his three sons became the fathers of the three races of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whereas Adam was the father established by God in His creation, Noah was the father established by God in His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The father in God s creation was completely destroyed and terminated due to the corruption of his descendants; therefore, God saved a man Noah to be the father of mankind on the earth who had been judged and destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Concerning Noah s descendants, there are four main points.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A. Spreading Over the Whole Earth</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Noah s three sons greatly multiplied, and soon their descendants spread over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>B. Separating into Nations</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Noah s descendants separated into many nations on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Beginning at this point in time, nations began to appear on the earth among men.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>C. Rebelling Collectively against God</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, Noah s descendants joined together and collectively rebelled against God; this is the story of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before Babel, people on the earth opposed God individually; they never reached the point of being organized together.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At Babel, however, men organized themselves to form an alliance, and they all joined together to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They wanted to build a tower whose top reached the heavens so that they might make a name for themselves and remove the name of God from the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>D. God Coming to Judge and to Scatter</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Just as the adamic race was terminated due to God s judgment, the line of Noah s descendants was also terminated by God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whereas the previous judgment involved destruction by the flood, this judgment involved the confounding of their language so that they would not be able to form an alliance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They were scattered due to their inability to communicate with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At this point Noah s descendants came to an end, and a third group of people became the focus of the Bible.</S>
