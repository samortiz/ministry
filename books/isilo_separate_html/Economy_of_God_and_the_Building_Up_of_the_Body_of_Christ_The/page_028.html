But our function in the Body of Christ is a function out from the Head. First we grow into the Head. Then out from the Head and based upon the Head, we have something for the building up of His Body.<h2 class=head3>All the Body Causing the Growth of the Body of Christ</h2><p>When we all allow Christ to grow within us, the result will be that all of us cause the growth of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:16 shows us that letting Christ grow within us unto the growth of the Body of Christ is first through every joint of the rich supply. These joints are the gifts mentioned in verse 11. They are the specially gifted members of the Body of Christ, and they are there for the supply of every member of the Body of Christ. Second, it is through the operation in measure of each one part, which is each of the members of the Body of Christ. When all the saints, who are the members of the Body of Christ, are supplied and perfected, they will all function according to their measure. This causes the growth, which is the building up, of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head3>All the Body Being Built Together</h2><p>When all the joints of the Body are supplying, and when each of the members of the Body is functioning, the Body is one. This oneness is the building. The building up of the whole Body is, on the one hand, through the fitting together, and on the other hand, through the knitting together. To be fitted together is for all the frame of the Body to be fitted together to form one structure. This is like the human body with its skeleton. In the skeleton there are the joints which fit the bones together to form one system. To be knitted together is for all the other parts to be joined to the skeleton and to be knit together into one Body. This is also like building a house. First, we join the whole frame together. Next, we fill up all the holes in the frame part by part. In this way the whole building is built up together through the fitting and the knitting. Thus, the whole Body becomes one. Here there are no human opinions or ideas; there is only the operation of the Spirit and the living of Christ within us. The result is that the Body builds itself up.<h2 class=head3>The Body Building Itself Up</h2><p>Ephesians 4:16 shows us that when the Body of Christ is fitted and knit together, the Body is built up by itself (Eph. 4:16b). This building is in love, which means in the element and sphere of the divine love. This kind of building is also the direct building of the Body of Christ by the members of the Body of Christ. It is difficult to find such a situation in Christianity today. I hope that in the Lord&#8217;s recovery our co-workers and the gifted ones would not only do the building work themselves, but would also perfect the saints, that the saints would function one by one and would directly build up the Body of Christ. May God bless us all that we would all see this vision of the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Seoul, Korea on November 8, 1988.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
