<p>We may apply the same principle to the church life. In the universe there is just one church, and in any locality there should also be one church. The one church is God&rsquo;s ordination and allotment. This is His portion to us, and this is His will. Whether we like the church or not does not mean anything, because the church is God&rsquo;s will. Perhaps at first you were very happy with the church, and you enjoyed a church life honeymoon. But later you came to dislike the church and desired a separation from it. Many Christians today have divorced themselves from the church. But if we do this, we neglect Matthew 16. If we can divorce the church, there will be no building. Through the centuries, many Christians have been like a woman who has had several husbands. After staying with a certain man for a period of time, she divorces him in order to be with another man. This is the actual situation among today&rsquo;s Christians. We need to recognize that the one church is God&rsquo;s will and ordination and that we have no choice about it. Therefore, eventually the church becomes the cross that we must bear. The question is whether we shall bear it like a criminal being executed or bear it willingly and happily. We should be like Christ who made the cross His choice, His first preference. Although being in the church may cause us difficulties, there is nothing we can do about it, for the church is the church. Thus, we all need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, grant me the sufficient grace to make me a willing cross-bearer.&rdquo; If you pray like this, you will become a happy bearer of the cross, not a criminal. As a result, you will have the genuine building.</p>
<p>Nearly all Christians today choose a church according to their taste, like people who choose restaurants according to their taste. Some may not like a certain church because the members shout and call on the name of the Lord. Others prefer a church where they can speak in tongues or hear musical performances by soloists, quartets, and choirs. If we are like this, then there is no bearing of the cross. Firstly, we must find out what the church is. Once we find out, there must be no further preference, no further choice. Whether we like the church or not, we must recognize the church is not according to our taste, but according to God&rsquo;s will and ordination. We simply need to claim the sufficient grace that we may become a happy bearer of the cross. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, make me a willing cross-bearer like You were. You learned what God&rsquo;s will was in Matthew 26, and then You were willing to do it. You were glad to take up the cross. You could have summoned twelve legions of angels to rescue You, but You did not do it. You were willing to bear the cross. Thank You, Lord, that through Your willingness to bear the cross we are here today as the church. Now, Lord, we want to partake of Your willingness to take up the cross that Your life may be released.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS BEING GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>Not only is the church God&rsquo;s will, but every brother and sister in the church is also His will. According to the Bible, we have no way to divide ourselves from the brothers and sisters. If we prefer certain brothers and sisters above others, we are a Bar-jona, a son of flesh and blood. In the church every brother and sister is God&rsquo;s will, and we have no choice regarding them. The Father has begotten them all, and we need to accept them all as His will. There is no room for our likes or dislikes, both of which are natural. In the church there are no special friendships and no preferences. Thus, eventually every brother and sister becomes a cross to us. However, if we receive mercy and grace from the Lord, we shall become a happy bearer of the cross, not a criminal condemned to execution.</p>
<p>If I say that I do not like a certain brother and will no longer spend any time with him, I spontaneously stop bearing the cross. As soon as I forsake the cross, the building ceases. The church has not been built over the past nineteen centuries because not many have been willing to take up the cross. Are you willing to bear the cross? The whole church, with every brother and sister in it, is a cross. We have no choice, no preference. We must bear the church and we must bear all of the saints, whether we like them or not. If we have our preference, we are not bearing the cross, and there can be no building. Wherever I am, I have no choice, for there is just one church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Kingdom for the Building of the Church &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
