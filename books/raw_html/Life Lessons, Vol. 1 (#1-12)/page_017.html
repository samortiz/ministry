<h2 class="head1">IV. THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>In the New Testament, there are two aspects of the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of God, related to the believers. On the one hand, He is the Spirit of life in us to be the essential Spirit of God that we may have the divine life to live and to exist. On the other hand, He is the Spirit of power upon us to be the economical Spirit of God that we may have the divine power and gift to work for God.</p><p><b>1) “The Spirit of reality…shall be in you”</b> (John 14:17).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit as the essential Spirit of God in the believers that they may have God’s life to live for God.</p><p><b>2) “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth”</b> (Acts 1:8).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit as the economical Spirit of God upon the believers that they may receive God’s power to work for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p><b>1) “The Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me [the Son]”</b> (John 15:26).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit becoming the transfiguration and reality of Christ in His resurrection to testify concerning the reality of Christ in resurrection.</p><p><b>2) “And having come, He [the Holy Spirit] will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment”</b> (John 16:8).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit coming to convict sinners of their sins that they may repent and believe into Christ to obtain eternal life.</p><p><b>3) “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit”</b> (John 3:6).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit, as God’s essential Spirit of life, regenerating the repentant sinner in his spirit that he may have the life of God and become a child of God.</p><p><b>4) “He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit”</b> (Titus 3:5).</p><p>This is also the Holy Spirit, as God’s essential Spirit of life, renewing man through regeneration that man may receive God’s salvation of life.</p><p><b>5) “The Holy Spirit who dwells in us”</b> (2 Tim. 1:14).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit, as God’s essential Spirit of life, abiding in us to continually supply us with God’s life and riches.</p><p><b>6) “The anointing which you received from Him [the Son with the Father] abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him”</b> (1 John 2:27).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit, as the essential Spirit of God, anointing the essence (element) of God into the believers, thus producing a teaching for them that they may abide in the Lord according to the teaching of God’s essence.</p><p><b>7) “Having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit”</b> (Rom. 15:16).</p><p>This is also the Holy Spirit, as God’s essential Spirit of life in the believers, supplying them with God’s holy nature, that is, the divine essence.</p><p><b>8) “Being transformed into the same [the Lord’s] image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit”</b> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p><p>This is still the Holy Spirit, as the essential Spirit of God in the believers, transforming them metabolically with God’s divine essence into the Lord’s image from one degree of glory to a higher degree of glory.</p><p><b>9) “I am sending forth the promise [the Holy Spirit] of My Father upon you…until you are clothed with power from on high [the heavens]”</b> (Luke 24:49).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit, as the economical Spirit of God, being the power on the believers for them to work for God.</p><p><b>10) “But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit...”</b> (1 Cor. 12:7-11).</p><p>This is the Holy Spirit upon the believers, as the economical Spirit of God, giving them diverse gifts to work for God.</p>
