	 <h2 class="head1">CHOOSING THOSE WHO ARE<br />
SUITABLE TO TAKE THE LEAD</h2>
<p>It is good for everyone to introduce themselves the first time that a small group meets together. However, this should be done spontaneously rather than formally. We must abandon all formality and rituals; otherwise, it will be difficult to have a group meeting. It will also be a waste of time and effort.</p>
<p>There are many brothers and sisters in the church who can lead a group. The elders should select suitable ones and commit the groups to their leading. Some of the younger brothers and sisters can learn with them. Those who take the lead should be able to train others. Furthermore, many saints with hidden &ldquo;talents&rdquo; will become manifest when they begin to function in the small groups. They will be like seasoned basketball players. Some are even more skillful than the coach. Such brothers and sisters are qualified to lead the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO LEAD</h2>
<p>There are several things that we need to do when we lead a group. First, we need to fan into flame the gift within the saints, that is, to stir them up, just as Paul did with Timothy: &ldquo;I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:6). For this we must know the spiritual condition of the saints. However, instead of asking the saints directly, we must understand their situation by contacting them and speaking with them. Instead of speaking too much, we should let the saints speak more. It is best if everyone can speak.</p>
<p>The way that a person speaks usually reveals his condition. For example, a high school graduate speaks like a high school student, but a college graduate speaks like a person with a college education. Not only so, a person&rsquo;s way of speaking reveals whether he is serious, thoughtful, and intelligent. When we go to a small group, we must learn to listen to the speaking of the saints. We may not be able to know a person&rsquo;s situation as soon as he opens his mouth, but after he has spoken three or five sentences, we will have a general idea of whether he loves the Lord.</p>
<p>Second, the purpose of our leading the groups is to coordinate with the move of the church. Suppose all the small groups have been stirred up. If the church has a burden for every group to learn an important truth, the elders can prepare material and give it to those who are helping to lead the groups. When these ones understand this truth, they can bring it to the groups.</p>
<p>Third, in order to advance the groups, we must enliven the saints. We must lead everyone in the group to speak and even create opportunities for them to speak. Some saints are afraid to speak, and others may not like to speak. Hence, we should create opportunities for the saints to speak. This is the basic secret of how to fan into flame the gift within them. We can use an old-fashioned stove as an illustration. If the stovepipe is blocked and the ash door is shut, air will not flow through the stove. As a result, the fire will not burn. We must clear the pipe and open the ash door to allow the air to flow. Then the fire will burn fiercely. If a saint remains silent, it is almost impossible to fan into flame the gift within him. We must find a way for him to open his mouth. However, asking difficult questions or questions involving his personal life make it difficult for him to speak. A question concerning the dormant saints who live nearby is simple. As the saints begin speaking, we will know their situation and how to lead them.</p>
<p>Fourth, the purpose of leading the groups is to recover the saints who have not met for a long time. It may be that the group will meet two or three times before the saints are able to pick up this burden. Therefore, before we fellowship concerning the dormant saints, we should collect some information from the church business office, which will prepare the information cards of the dormant saints. With this information, we can fellowship with the saints in a thorough way. However, our fellowship should not be solemn. It is not a company business meeting. We should have casual fellowship with our family.</p>
<p>We must practice these matters in the groups. We must know everyone&rsquo;s condition, find out if they are familiar with the dormant saints who live around them, and then help them to pick up a burden for the dormant saints. If we can accomplish these few things, we can properly lead the meeting. Then the meeting will gradually be enlivened. However, we must remember that our function is only to enliven the meeting. Once we have achieved this, we should let go. The group no longer needs us to lead it. We should let the saints in the group continue on their own.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STUDYING HOW TO ADVANCE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Should the saints who lead the groups meet regularly to fellowship and study how to go on?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This suggestion is good, but we already have too many meetings. This suggestion adds another meeting. Hence, this matter needs much consideration. It is definitely necessary for us to come together regularly to fellowship and study how to lead the groups, but it would also be sufficient to occasionally meet for some mutual teaching and exercise. For example, a coach will gather his players together only a few times during a game to give them instructions. It is more important for the players to practice regularly. Therefore, the primary matter is to divide the saints into groups and then assign serving ones to the groups. The serving ones should be quick to enliven the groups. Fellowship and study can be later.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should we keep a record of the small group&rsquo;s meetings? How should we use the time of the group meeting?</em></p>
<p>Answer: It is best to keep a record of the small group, but it is not necessary to submit a report. Every group can keep the statistics it feels are necessary. This will help in leading the small groups. According to the practical situation of the saints, you should decide how long the meetings should be. If the saints have more time, the meeting can be longer. If they do not have much time, the meeting should be shorter. There is no need for rules concerning this matter.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should we form the groups according to meeting halls or according to districts? Should the responsible brothers be involved in leading the small groups?</em></p>
<p>Answer: In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we must learn to always begin from a foundation and to reject centralized authority. The groups do not have to report to the meeting halls. To do so is to follow the principle of centralization, which will weaken the function of the groups. Every group is a unit in itself, but those who lead the groups should always have fellowship with one another and keep the oneness in spirit.</p>
<p><em>Question: How should those who are in the brothers&rsquo; houses and the sisters&rsquo; houses be formed into groups? How do we group those who have specific services?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We do not need to fellowship about specific services. As the small groups are formed, situations will arise. We should be prepared to make adjustments whenever necessary. Concerning the saints who live in the brothers&rsquo; or sisters&rsquo; houses, the principle is the same. They should be formed into groups according to where they live. However, small adjustments may be made. Suppose there are eleven saints in a brothers&rsquo; house. They can either form a group, or they can combine with other saints who live around them to form two groups. Then the brothers in that house can take care of two groups.</p>
<p><em>Question: The work on the college campuses, which is a specific service, has taken shape. If we break up into groups, we may suffer a great loss.</em></p>
<p>Answer: As we are leading the small groups, we will face such situations. We need to be flexible to make adjustments according to the situation. Since the college campus work is doing very well, we should not stop it. Rather, it should be kept as part of the specific service on college campuses. We should study the situation and decide accordingly. This does not contradict the principle of forming groups. Everyone has to be assigned to a group, whether according to geography or according to their service.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should the goal of the small groups be to focus on the gospel, not edification?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The function of the small group is comprehensive. As long as you can advance the group by fanning into flame the gift within the saints and stirring them up, the group will spontaneously be able to bear the burden of the specific services. However, we should not expect too much. We should labor diligently, because some groups may advance faster and others slower. We cannot expect every group to be the same.</p>
<p><em>Question: The small groups are held in the saints&rsquo; homes. The saint in whose home it is prepares snacks and sometimes even invites the saints for a meal. What is the principle concerning this matter?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Initially, it is best not to invite the saints for a meal, because it will become burdensome. It is necessary to prepare snacks, but it should not be the responsibility of one home. Several homes should take turns doing it or coordinate together in the preparation.</p>
<p><em>Question: We already have a sisters&rsquo; group. Should this group be stopped to form a new small group?</em></p>
<p>Answer: This depends on the burden of the sisters. If the sisters feel that they have time to come together for prayer apart from their small group, it would be very good. If they feel that they cannot do so much because of the lack of time, then they should stop. The principle is not to insist on uniformity. It is the same with our physical life. Once we are in uniformity, there will be many problems. Some people have tuberculosis and can have only a certain diet. Others have stomach problems and require a different diet. People who are healthy eat in a certain way; those who are weak eat in another way. Therefore, although we encourage everyone to eat, we cannot make them eat the same food. We are now encouraging the small groups, and the saints have the freedom to do what they want to do. It is all right for some saints to have morning revival together and then come together again in the afternoon to pray. We cannot stop everything else just because we are in small groups. These saints should decide whether or not they should stop an existing gathering.</p>
<p><em>Question: Should there be a particular pursuit in the small groups? It seems as if this is necessary to prevent us from empty chatting.</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is no need to have a rule concerning this. It depends on how the leading one guides the group onto the proper path. After we have fanned the gift in the saints, we can lead them toward serving and being perfected. What we are doing can be compared to driving a car in an unfamiliar place. It may not be practical to drive a long distance. We should drive short distances. A coach always teaches the players a technique for their practice until it is perfected. Then he teaches them a new technique. We are in the first stage. It will be a great blessing from the Lord if after three to five weeks we have some perfection.</p>
<p>This is not difficult to achieve. Once a fire is kindled, it will begin to burn. If a fire does not burn, it is because we have not kindled or fanned it into flame. Once the groups are fanned into flame, the fire will burn fiercely. This is similar to rubbing pieces of wood together. Once we kindle a fire, it will spread to the other pieces of wood. Once the fire in a group starts burning, everyone will begin to function and to restore the dormant saints. Therefore, we should take care of the fanning. Then the situation concerning the dormant saints will change spontaneously.</p>
<p>I am pleading with all of us to be faithful, love the Lord, and be patient. We should not seek quick results or covet success. We should simply labor aggressively and not care for the results. This is a basic principle. We have four hundred saints who can rise up to lead four to five thousand saints. Even if the groups meet once a week, after three to five weeks, we will cause four to five thousand saints in the church to be burning. This is how drops of dew become a river. We all need to make an effort. This is a tremendous matter.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that the brothers and sisters among us have the qualifications. They have been meeting regularly and have listened to many messages, so they have reached a certain level of spirituality. Furthermore, they love the Lord and know how to pray. This is our capital. Now it is easy for a fire to be fanned, because the stove is ready and there is even wood in the stove. All that is needed is to fan the flame. In some cases, the fire is already burning; we only need to continue fanning it.</p>
<p>We must admit that in the past we did not pay enough attention to the small groups. We had an attitude of leaving everything to work itself out. Now the Lord has led us to advance the small groups. Some of the saints in the groups may even be more capable than we are. We need to observe them. Some of the groups are strong, and it seems that they do not need others to lead them, but they may still keep some old practices. So we still need to lead them into the new way. Every group will have better results if they take the new way.</p>
