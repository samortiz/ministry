BEING MET BY GOD&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>However, the requirements of the kingdom are not meant to be met and fulfilled by us; they are to be met and fulfilled by God&rsquo;s life. The requirements of the kingdom speak forth how able God is; the requirements of the law, on the other hand, speak forth how impotent man is. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Only with difficulty will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens...It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (19:23-24). I do not know if anyone has seen an eye of a needle large enough for a camel to pass through. Actually, no matter how large the eye of a needle can be, it cannot make possible the passage of a camel. Even if we have never seen a camel and do not know how big it is, at least we have seen the eye of a needle. Even the largest eye of a needle is not large enough. No matter how large the eye of a needle could be, a person could not pass through it. How then could a camel pass through it? The Lord Jesus used such an illustration, telling the disciples that it is even more difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. This means that entering into the kingdom of the heavens is impossible with man. Upon hearing and understanding this, the disciples immediately asked the Lord, &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo; (v. 25). This is a good question&mdash;who can be saved? This is an impossible thing.</p>
<p>Hence, the Lord answered immediately, &ldquo;With men this is impossible&rdquo; (v. 26). With man, the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s requirements is certainly impossible; it is unattainable by man. It is impossible for man to be perfect as God is perfect. Likewise, it is impossible for man to have a righteousness that surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees. It is even more impossible for man not to have any filthy thought or any anger. No one can fulfill any of these requirements. When someone slaps us on our right cheek, we need to turn to him the other also&mdash;this is not something that we can do. This is as impossible as requiring a cat to fly.</p>
<p>Who then can enter into the kingdom of the heavens? The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;With men this is impossible,&rdquo; but He went on to say, &ldquo;with God all things are possible&rdquo; (v. 26). Hallelujah! With man this is impossible, but with God it is possible. Hence, to enter into the kingdom depends not on man but on God. The requirements of the kingdom cannot be met by man; they can be met only by God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE VITAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE KINGDOM AND LIFE</h2>
<p>How does God meet the requirements of the kingdom? He does it by coming into us to be our life. In the New Testament we must see two things, the kingdom and life. These two are great and weighty things. The Lord said, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (4:17). He also said, &ldquo;Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens&rdquo; (5:20). The requirements for entering the kingdom of the heavens are great. However, there is a life that can meet these requirements. God&rsquo;s Word says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him [the Lord Jesus] may have eternal life&rdquo; (John 3:15); &ldquo;he who has the Son has the life&rdquo; (1 John 5:12); and &ldquo;unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (John 3:3). This means that if we are regenerated, we can see the kingdom of God; if we have God&rsquo;s life, we have the way to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament we find not only the kingdom but also life. Whereas the kingdom is a demand, life is a supply. We see a strict demand in the New Testament. This demand is not the law but is something higher than the law. It requires us not merely to be perfect or excellent but to be like God and ultimately to be perfect as God is perfect.</p>
<p>Is anything higher than God? Is there anything more perfect than God? The kingdom requires us to be as high as God and as perfect as God. God&rsquo;s Word says, &ldquo;Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees...&rdquo; (Matt. 5:20). The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is the righteousness of the moralists and the law keepers. If our righteousness does not surpass this kind of righteousness, we cannot enter into the kingdom. This shows how high the requirements of the kingdom are. We must be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect (v. 48); this is to be perfect as God is perfect. This is a high requirement that cannot be met by man; with man it is impossible. However, with God it is possible. How can it be possible with God? It is possible through His entering into us as our life. When He enters into us as our life, He supplies us with the power that enables us to do what we otherwise cannot do.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
