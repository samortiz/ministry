   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR DAILY RIGHTEOUSNESS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 we see certain aspects of this portion: But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, Who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is God s power and God s wisdom 1 Cor 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As wisdom to us from God, Christ becomes our daily righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Daily we may enjoy Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we enjoy Him in this way, we can declare, Angels and demons, and all human beings, I am right with God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am right with my family and with all the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is my testimony because daily Christ is my righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can also testify that Christ is our daily sanctification and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day by day we enjoy Him as such a portion to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we can expect the angels and demons to confirm the fact that we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can say, Angels and demons, you must realize that I am holy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I ask you to confirm the fact of my holiness in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Son of God, who is both the wisdom of God and the power of God, is becoming my daily holiness and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Holiness is the substance, whereas sanctification is the activity of being made holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Day by day we have not only holiness, the element, but we also have sanctification, the process.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Christ who is our portion for our enjoyment is sanctifying us daily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A married couple can experience Christ as their righteousness and sanctification in their married life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose a husband is unhappy with his wife and gives her a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the sister calls on the name of the Lord Jesus, she will gain Him as righteousness and also as sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She will experience the Lord sanctifying her from within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s moving inwardly will keep her from losing her temper with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, she may be offended and begin to argue with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simply by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, we experience something mysterious and wonderful within us sanctifying us and keeping us from losing our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, this sanctification becomes our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, this holiness is a Person, the Son of God, the unique portion into which God has called us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has called us into the fellowship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now, daily and hourly, we need to enjoy Him, first as righteousness, then as sanctification, and then as redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE DEEP THINGS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 Corinthians chapter two we see that Christ, the mysterious One, is the deep things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to discern Him and realize Him, we must be a spiritual person, a person who exercises the spirit and lives in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are soulish, those who live in the soul, we shall not be able to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only by living in the spirit and exercising our spirit can we know Christ in order to experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A LIVING FOUNDATION</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 3, Christ is a living foundation, a foundation that grows.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this chapter Paul says that he planted, that Apollos watered, and that God gives the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To give the growth is a matter of growing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Christ who grows within us is the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, it is a living, growing foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the foundation grows in us, this growth produces gold, silver, and precious stones, the materials needed for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is to experience Christ, to enjoy Christ, and to partake of Christ so that we may be transformed for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way we have the precious materials for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is to live Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>OUR FEAST</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1 Corinthians 5:8 we have Christ as our feast.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is not merely our Passover; He is our Passover feast.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we are feasting on Him and enjoying Him as the unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As our portion, Christ is our unleavened enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we enjoy this portion, we are cleansed from every kind of leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Enjoying Christ as the unleavened bread causes us to become unleavened.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This purification from every kind of leaven is not a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not the result of being placed on a surgical table; it comes from sitting at a table of feasting where we enjoy Christ as unleavened bread.</S>
