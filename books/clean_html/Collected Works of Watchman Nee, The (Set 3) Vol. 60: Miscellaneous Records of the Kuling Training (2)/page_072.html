<h2 class="head2">Christians Not Engaging in War</h2><p>There is a basic difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament in the matter of going to war. The Old Testament shows us that God is a God of warfare. He ordained that there would be war in Canaan. We cannot say that war is altogether wrong. However, in the New Testament we are made ambassadors of peace. In this age the Lord does not go to war. He says, "My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My attendants would be struggling so that I would not be delivered to the Jews" (John 18:36). In the garden of Gethsemane, Judas came with men to take the Lord. Peter took out his sword and cut off the right ear of one of the servants of the high priest. The Lord told him, "Put the sword into its sheath" (vv. 10-11). Our Lord does not call us to war. We have to remember that the goal of God's work is peace. The proper place of a Christian's sword is the sheath. Some have argued that the Lord once told us to buy swords. In Luke 22:35-38 the Lord said to the disciples, "When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?" This was what the Lord told them to do before. Now things had changed. The Lord told them to bring everything they had and that he who had no sword should sell his garment and buy one. The disciples did not understand this and answered immediately, "Lord, behold, here are two swords." The Lord said, "It is enough." The Lord was saying, "You have spoken enough. The age has changed. From now on I will be rejected. Previously, men welcomed Me, but now I am rejected." The disciples did not see this at all. (A little while later, in the garden of Gethsemane, Peter still cut off the ear of the servant of the high priest with his sword.) If I tell the brothers that the Lord's word is a lamp unto my feet, and they come back and ask if it is electric lamp or oil lamp, I will say, "It is enough." Today we have to be clear of our way. We do not want to go to war with anyone. In the ancient days the Jews traveled with swords and staffs. The Lord told the disciples to sell their garment to buy a sword, but this sword was not for warfare. He said this to the disciples because men would no longer receive the Lord and would no longer render any supply to the disciples. The Lord has never commissioned us to go to war because His kingdom is not of this world.</p><p>Should a Christian be against war? We have no compulsion to fight. We are standing on Christian ground, and we are not for war. But this does not mean that we will oppose war. War is something that a government engages in. A government can declare war, but Christians should abide by Christ's commandment. The Lord has not commanded us to be fighters. At the time of the Franco-Prussian war in Europe, one person wrote, "If a Christian goes to war, he is a fallen Christian." But no individual has a choice when a nation goes to war. If a man is forced to fight, we have nothing to say about this. It is between him and the Lord. But we have to be clear that God's Spirit is for peace in this age. The Lord said, "Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matt. 5:9). If a brother finds himself in a war, he should say to those in authority, "I believe that the human soul is eternal. I cannot kill." What the authority will want to do with us is up to it. We cannot be fighters. If a brother stands in a battlefield and his enemy is a brother, surely he cannot kill him. If he is a sinner, he cannot kill him either. If he kills him, he is sending his soul to the eternal lake of fire. Hence, a Christian cannot go to war.</p><p>The above discussions pertain to a Christian's attitude and practice with regard to civil government and his country. We have to make these things clear to the new ones so that they will have the right attitude and will choose the right way.</p>
