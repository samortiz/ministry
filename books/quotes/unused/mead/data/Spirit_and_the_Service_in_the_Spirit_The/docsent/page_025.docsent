   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO POSSIBILITIES OF LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thus, a Christian has two possibilities of living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One possibility is to live in the outer man and the other possibility is to live in the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every Christian must bear the responsibility for either living in the outer man or living in the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have said before, this is like having two kinds of lamps in your room; one is an oil lamp and the other is an electric lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is up to you if you want to light the oil lamp or switch on the electric lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have two lives and can live out two kinds of living as two kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do we want to live by our human life or by the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do we want to live in the outer man or in the inner man?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is entirely up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>SERVING BY THE SOUL BEING OF THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since we should not live by the soul, we should also not serve by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostle says that we are not sufficient of ourselves for the ministry, but that our sufficiency is from God 2 Cor 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be by the self is to be by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not serve as ministers by our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As ministers of the new covenant, we serve under the new covenant by the spirit, not by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we often think that all we need is to serve and that we do not need to care by what we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We often think that as long as our service is right and good, we do not need to worry about anything else because everything is fine without any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not true!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even a proper or good service may still have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Indeed, many services that are right and good have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, a brother may be rich in his emotion and truly care for the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day he suddenly remembers two brothers who often miss the meetings, so he decides to visit them and eventually he goes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would ask you, is it good for him to visit the brothers like this?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some may say it is not good, but how can you say this?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not good to go watch a movie or to sin and do evil, but is it also not good to visit the brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You cannot say that.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is really good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not evil but good.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It appears to be a good thing done for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to ask, though, did the brother whom I just mentioned visit the brothers from his soul or from his spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Did the Spirit of God send him, or did he go on his own?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some would say he went from his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, he went from his soul, not from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He himself wanted to go; it was not the Spirit of God sending him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must ask further.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Out of which part of the soul did he go?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may say he went out of the emotion, others out of the will, and still others out of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These three answers cover all three parts of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, he acted from all three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His visiting was initiated in his emotion, passed through his mind, and was decided by the will; therefore, it was entirely out of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever comes out of the urge of the emotion, the consideration of the mind, and the decision of the will is from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must also ask whether such a visiting from the soul is carried out through the outer man or the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Naturally, it is through the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, we must ask whether it is done out of the self or out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Naturally, it is out of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since this going is done out of the self, it is also of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then, is the self good or bad?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may say it is not good; they are absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The self is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone s self is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet it is marvelous that now a good thing can come out of the bad self.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How can something good be in something bad?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can a good thing come out of a bad thing?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How do we explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that the things which we think are good can come out of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whatever comes out of the self comes out of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It does not matter how good they are in our eyes, the source is still the soul, the self.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many times the things that come out of the self are very good, but the source is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we must see that even the good things in the service, such as visiting the brothers, can possibly come out from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This kind of service cannot be considered the service of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It can only be considered the service of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of service might be needed, but is it acceptable?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some brothers say that we should not accept it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But many times is our service not this kind of service?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do good things, but they come out from the wrong source.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many times when we serve, we are simply doing the right thing from the wrong source.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This should not be.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should visit the brothers, but we should not visit them by our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not be sent by the soul to visit the brothers.</S>
