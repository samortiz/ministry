<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. The Virgins behind Her, Her Friends,<br>Being Led to the King</H2><P>Psalm 45:14b says, "The virgins behind her, her friends,/Will be led to you." This signifies that the overcoming saints will be invited to the marriage dinner of Christ (Rev. 19:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. The Virgins Being Led with Rejoicing<br>and Exultation and Entering the King's Palace</H2><P>"They will be led with rejoicing and exultation;/They will enter the king's palace" (Psa. 45:15). This signifies that the overcoming saints will enter, with rejoicing and exultation, the New Jerusalem as Christ's palace (Rev. 3:12).</P><P>As we read this psalm, we need to pay attention to the crucial points concerning Christ and the church. One crucial point is the matter of the abode and the palace. First we have the abode and then the palace. When Christ becomes our abode, we become His abode&#151;a mutual abode. Because Christ is the King and we are the queen, eventually this mutual abode becomes the palace, which signifies the New Jerusalem.</P><P>What is the New Jerusalem? In brief, the New Jerusalem is the redeeming God wrought into the believers and mingled with them to be one entity. The church today is such an entity, for, like the New Jerusalem, the church is actually the redeeming God wrought into the believers and mingled with them to be a single entity. Today the church is a miniature of the coming New Jerusalem. In eternity in the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the church. Therefore, both the church and the New Jerusalem are the Triune God Himself wrought into us and mingled with us to be one entity. This entity is a mutual abode; it is both our dwelling place and God's dwelling place. In the New Jerusalem, a mutual abode, God will dwell with His redeemed people for eternity.</P>
