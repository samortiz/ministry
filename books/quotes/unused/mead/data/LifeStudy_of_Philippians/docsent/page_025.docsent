   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT DRAWN OUT OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would stand firm, we must be in one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would strive together, we need to be with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our experience we realize that there is a great difference between being in one spirit and being with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever the church is attacked and opposed, we need to stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where do we stand firm?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We stand firm in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not stay in our spirit, we shall be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First opinions will enter in, then there will be dissension, and eventually division will come about.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even if three brothers are together and do not remain in the spirit, they will eventually be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The different opinions, thoughts, and concepts will lead to dissension, and this dissension will undermine the oneness and cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we can stand firm only if we are in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In no other organ of our being can we stand firm.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we consider our experience, we shall realize that if we are drawn out of the spirit when we are opposed or attacked, doubts and questions will rise up within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose the Philippian believers did not remain in the spirit when they were opposed by the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They might have had doubts or questions about Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They might have wondered if Paul had told them all the truth, or they might have thought that the Judaistic preachers had something more that they needed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such doubts and questions do not have their source in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we return to our spirit, stay there, and close our being to negative questions and doubts, there are no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Throughout the years we have been attacked.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The enemy attacks constantly and refuses to let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During times of attack or opposition, we may be pulled out of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we realize that this is our situation, we must immediately return to our spirit and close the door to Satan s attack.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To remain in the spirit in this way is to stand firm in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>During the years I was with Brother Nee in China, I saw how many attacks came upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In those days he was the umbrella, and I was one under the umbrella.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because he was the umbrella, the rain beat down on him, not on me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sometimes, when the attacks first came, doubts would creep into my being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This would happen especially early in the morning or late at night.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Occasionally the thought would come that perhaps we are wrong in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever I detected such an inroad of the enemy, I would return to the spirit and exercise my spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then I could stand firm in one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>During times of attack and opposition, it is crucial that we remain in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only our spirit can keep us together at such times.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to stand firm not with one spirit, but in one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A PLACE TO STAND</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Standing firm requires a place, and this place is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The leading ones in a local church should not ask whether or not others agree with them in a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the wrong question.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Among the elders there is no need for agreement, but there is the desperate need to remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Diplomats may need agreements, but elders do not.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the elders in a local church remain in the spirit, there will be no need for agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To try to come to an agreement is an indication that we are not in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead of trying to agree, we should simply stand firm in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>USING THE WEAPONS OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Standing firm in one spirit, however, is a defensive measure, not an offensive one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we have indicated, without an offense we shall not be able to maintain a proper defense.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, in order to stand firm in our spirit, we also need to strive, to fight together, with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whereas the preposition in denotes a realm, the preposition with denotes an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The realm is our spirit, but the instrument is our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The faculties of our soul may be likened to weapons used in warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to strive together with these weapons of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not think that it is sufficient only to be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No, we also need to be exercised in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should be thoughtful in our mind, full of feeling in our emotion, and strong in our will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we shall have powerful weapons with which to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some seemingly spiritual people are like jellyfish in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are very wishy-washy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They never want to fight or strive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that they do not have the needed weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are very different from the apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When Paul stood, he stood in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But when he strove, he strove with a very strong soul.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our problem is that either we are wishy-washy and do not use the faculties of our soul, or we become dissenting and fight each other instead of fighting the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Those who are wishy-washy are like jellyfish.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such ones not only lack backbone, but do not seem to have any bones whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Wanting to be spiritual, they always act nice, kind, and humble, never striving with their soul in the faith of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Others, however, may fight and strive, using the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But in fighting they become dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Instead of fighting the enemy, they fight against other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the reason Paul tells us to strive with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>With one soul we should fight against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although it is rather easy to be one spirit, it is not so easy to strive together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the spirit we have the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>These functions of the spirit are not the cause of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The cause of problems between us and others is found in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The mind may be troublesome, the emotion may be destructive, and the will may be stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The sisters are usually troubled by the giant of the emotion, whereas the brothers are troubled by two giants the mind and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Most men are strong in their concept and in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They do not want to follow others foolishly, but insist on their own honor and integrity.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>For the most part, the sisters exercise the emotion more than the will or the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As a result, they are easily moved by the sight of someone weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No matter how well educated a sister may be, she is still a female and influenced much by her emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is true of older sisters as well as younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Our problems, therefore, are found in the soul in the mind and will for the brothers and in the emotion for the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST BY STANDING AND STRIVING</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We surely need Paul s charge to strive together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In our fighting, our striving, we need to be on the alert concerning our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We need to be watchful with respect to our thought, our feeling, and our intention.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We should not give any ground to our natural mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They must not be allowed to interfere with our striving together with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We who fight for God s interest must be in one spirit, and we must strive with one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is another way for us to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>To stand firm is to experience Christ, and to strive together is also to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Let us all experience Christ by standing firm in one spirit, striving together with one soul.</S>
