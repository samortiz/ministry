   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 13 Date:July 8, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER Y. Y.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Buddhist family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Every time others asked whether I had sinned, I would answer proudly that I had never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But a question remained in me: "What if I have sinned?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My older sister was the first in my family to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later I went and listened to the gospel myself and believed in the Lord that first day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the same day I consecrated myself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From that time onward, my life completely changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I was like Mary who had chosen the best portion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I often got up in the middle of the night to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I studied medicine because even though there are many doctors in the world, I asked myself where I could find doctors who were spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I began to preach the gospel almost every day, and I considered myself a spiritual doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I tired easily, but many people came to me for consultation, and I did not know what to do about it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once I heard a voice which seemed to say, "Just follow the footsteps of the flock."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later I found the local church and was baptized into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I began to deal with my dress and my hairstyle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But I suffered persecution in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sufferings I went through during that year were unprecedented in my whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1942 I discovered that I had heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord told me, "I will be with you wherever you go."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I could not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said again, "He who does not believe is condemned already."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later I met Brother Nee in Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I asked him how one could hear God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said that a proud person could never hear God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I realized that my service was only superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My attitude, words, and thoughts were all condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I felt that my walk and living before God were lifeless.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later I saw that I have died in Christ already and that I live in Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If God wants to say something to me, I ask that He would be merciful to me and open my heart to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Not Being Self-conscious about Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not have to lend a helping hand to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All we have to do is fall down before God, and we will find strength.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has His way of smiting man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While we are being smitten, we may think that everything is finished and gone because we do not see anything coming back to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>From our side, we feel that we are being stripped and emptied continually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But from the side of Aaron's rod, there is budding, blossoming, and even fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the type, all of these happen at night, while we are sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The return of the power of resurrection is something that passes our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When many people go through God's discipline, they try to engineer an artificial recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, all they find is disappointment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should only be conscious of our own weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not be conscious of any recovery or resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Growth and resurrection are in God's hand; they are outside the realm of human consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Parents cannot watch over their children constantly to see how many inches they have grown.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Flowers will always blossom, but we do not know when they will blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more thorough and strict God works on us, the better it is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not expect any conscious awareness of resurrection itself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The exceedingly great power of resurrection is upon us, but it must not remain in us only.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The electricity in the wire is always flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As it flows, it lights the electric bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But as soon as the switch is turned off, the light goes out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The electricity is generated in the power plant and remains in the power plant, but it does not remain in the electric wire.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Death Being the Basis of Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Resurrection life is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No one can grasp resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we always know when the Lord's cross is applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we move on in the way of discipline, we will experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should only be concerned about our own condition; we do not have to worry about how much resurrection we have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Silently and without our noticing it, resurrection will manifest itself in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After God's dealing hand has been upon us for a while and we experience recovery and resurrection, we will find ourself being empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As we go on in this way, God will smite us until we become as good as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will lose all hope, as if we are completely and totally dead.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then all the conditions for resurrection will be in place.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before a man dies, he will hope for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He will want to receive power and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But death is the prerequisite to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have to pray for light.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As soon as light shines, we will see our own evil and weakness, and we will realize that we are useless, hopeless, and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then we will experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, when we are weak, we do not have to ask to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we are useless, we do not have to ask to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we are unclean, we do not have to ask to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We only need to ask for light.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once light comes, we will be finished and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then subconsciously God will bring resurrection to us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Without death, there can be no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What a big contrast there is between death and resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose we have seen our own weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Having lost all hope, we will realize that we are evil beyond all hope, and we will not even expect any blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We no longer look for resurrection because we have lost all hope, even the hope of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Seemingly, this is a contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Actually, this is the time we experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We think that resurrection is something that God gives to us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is why we look to God to somehow grant us resurrection in the midst of His dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We forget that resurrection is based on death; without death there is no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We can say that one prerequisite of resurrection is losing all hope.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Another prerequisite of resurrection is extreme weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have to remember that the seed of resurrection is planted in death.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God takes care of resurrection; we only need to pray for light.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>All we have to do is see that we are weak beyond all hope.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The most basic error that man commits is in hoping to be not as weak and corrupt as he is.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He sees that he is poor, so he asks God for grace, for the power of recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But the more he does this, the less he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If he does not die, how can he be resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Many people pray for recovery before they have even died.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is a big frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Everyone wants to climb up, but God wants to bring us down.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The lower we go, the closer we are to death.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>As we take a step further towards death, we take a step further towards resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Once we die, we resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the way we touch resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Those who try to climb up before they die are moving further and further from death.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>As a result they are also moving further and further from resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The more they move, the less chance they have to experience resurrection.</S>
