<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S ORIGINAL INTENTION<br />
AND ITS ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4; 1 Cor. 9:17; Eph. 3:2; Col. 1:25; 1 Cor. 4:1; 1 Pet. 4:10; Gen. 1:26-27; 2:9-12, 22; Rev. 21:1-3, 11, 18-22; 22:1-2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">DEFINITION OF THE WORD DISPENSATION</h2>
<p>In these messages we will be on a basic item in the Bible, the divine dispensation. We will not try to cover the entire theme of God&rsquo;s dispensation. Our burden is just to see the central view of the divine dispensation. Dispensation is a translation of the Greek word, <em>oikonomia.</em> This Greek word has been anglicized into the English word economy and is equal to the word dispensation. The basic meaning of this word is a kind of arrangement, a kind of an arranged order. So it may be considered as a plan, as a management, or as an administration. God has a divine arrangement of His administration. The entire Bible tells us God has been working and is still working on this plan.</p>
<p>Of course God&rsquo;s plan includes a lot of steps, but many Christians have misunderstood the word dispensation to merely indicate a period of time or an epoch for certain dealings of God with man. The best Bible teachers understand that this word denotes God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s arrangement, of His full salvation. This is absolutely right, but we still have to ask, What is the goal of God&rsquo;s full salvation? What will be the consummation of God&rsquo;s plan?</p>
<p>If we look into the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation, we could see God&rsquo;s works and also the goal of God&rsquo;s works. We can realize that God has been going on toward a goal. Some may say that this goal is simply God&rsquo;s full salvation. But what then is the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation? Not many Christians have seen the definite goal of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 tells us that God created man in His own image (vv. 26-27). This surely indicates that God wants man to express Himself. At the end of the Bible there is a city which bears the glory of God and which is the composition of many names. There are twelve names from Israel and twelve from the church. All twenty-four of these names denote the saved ones of God. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel denote all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament, and the names of the twelve Apostles denote all the saints of the New Testament. This tells us that the New Jerusalem is a composition of all God&rsquo;s redeemed ones.</p>
<p>The city bears the glorious image of God, denoting that this composition of God&rsquo;s redeemed ones is the expression of God. This makes it very clear that God&rsquo;s goal is to work Himself into His redeemed people. God wants to work Himself into His chosen people that He may have a full expression in eternity. This is the goal of God&rsquo;s full salvation. God&rsquo;s dispensation is toward this goal. We must see, not only God&rsquo;s dispensation, but also the goal of God&rsquo;s dispensation, that is, God is working Himself into His chosen people.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 1:10 we can see that there is a plan, an arrangement, or an administration for God to head up all things in Christ. This is God&rsquo;s dispensation, His universal administration, to head up all things in Christ. Presently we cannot see that all things are headed up in Christ, but God is working on this. First God would collect His chosen people and put them into Christ. Then He would work Christ into them so that they all might become the parts and members of Christ with Christ as their Head. All these dear Christians have been headed up into Christ. We know that Christ is our Head, and we all are members of His Body. This gives us a picture of the heading up of things in Christ. Although we may come from many different countries, we have been headed up into Christ. In the name of Christ and in His enlivening Spirit we have been headed up into Christ. Christ is the heading up. Verse 10 tells us that in the fullness of the times God will head up the entire universe into Christ. By that time God will be fully expressed. This is the goal of God&rsquo;s dispensation.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:9 also speaks of God&rsquo;s plan, the dispensation of God&rsquo;s mystery. This is a kind of order, or system, or arrangement, or administration of God&rsquo;s full salvation. According to the context of Ephesians 3:9, God&rsquo;s plan of His full salvation is to dispense the unsearchable riches of Christ into His chosen people to produce the church. The dispensing of Christ&rsquo;s riches is for the producing of the church to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:4 we see God&rsquo;s household administration, which is to dispense Himself into His children that He may have a household, the church, to express Himself. From these three portions of the Word, we can have the general view of the meaning of God&rsquo;s dispensation. The Greek word, <em>oikonomia,</em> is composed of two words: <em>oikos,</em> meaning house and <em>nomos,</em> meaning law. Hence, it refers to the house arrangement, household management or administration. The word denotes the management and distribution of the wealth of a rich household. Joseph in the Old Testament was an example. Joseph was the administrator of Pharaoh&rsquo;s house, which was so rich that it could even supply other nations. There was a need of some management and administration and order and system to distribute the riches of Pharaoh&rsquo;s house. Otherwise, the riches would lie there undistributed.</p>
<p>By this you can see what is the <em>oikonomia.</em> That is the household management to distribute and dispense the riches of the house. Our Father surely has a great house with a rich store of the unsearchable riches of Christ. This great house needs some administration, some management, some system, some plan to dispense and distribute all the riches to God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>The biggest distributor in the New Testament was the Apostle Paul. By reading Paul&rsquo;s writings, you see that Paul in the New Testament was like Joseph in the Old Testament. The unsearchable riches of Christ were under his administration and distribution.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:17 Paul used the word <em>oikonomia</em> to denote the stewardship, that is, the responsibility of such an administration, entrusted to him for preaching the gospel. In Ephesians 3 he used this word again to denote the office, the duty, of a steward in God&rsquo;s house, which he called &ldquo;the stewardship of the grace of God,&rdquo; committed to him to dispense the grace of God to His children in the church. And in Colossians 1:25 he used the same word again to denote the stewardship given to him by God to complete His word, that is, the divine revelation concerning Christ for the producing of the church as His Body.</p>
<p>Paul was given the stewardship, the office, the duty, of God&rsquo;s dispensation to distribute all the riches of Christ. Even today we are still under the distribution of Paul. Paul is still doing a dispensing work even as Joseph did. In Joseph&rsquo;s time all the people had to go to Joseph for the rich supply. If you take away Paul&rsquo;s fourteen Epistles from the New Testament, so much of the riches are gone. Many unsearchable riches are under Paul&rsquo;s distribution. His distribution is just to distribute the unsearchable riches of Christ to all of us in order that we may be the expression of God.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 4:1 Paul called himself and his co-workers &ldquo;stewards (<em>oikonomos</em>) of the mysteries of God,&rdquo; denoting that they were God&rsquo;s servants, entrusted with the responsibility to carry out the divine dispensing according to God&rsquo;s dispensation. And in 1 Peter 4:10, Peter told us that all the believers are the stewards of God&rsquo;s dispensation, dispensing the varied grace of God to supply the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). All this indicates that the intention of God in His dispensation is to dispense all His riches in Christ through the Spirit into His chosen people that they may enjoy Him and become His expression.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ORIGINAL INTENTION</h2>
<p>Our burden is to see God&rsquo;s original intention. According to the record of Genesis 1 and 2 God&rsquo;s original intention was to have a Bride. After God created man, Adam was single. He was a bachelor. But then God said it was not good for man to be alone. This was a type. According to the revelation of the Bible, God is the unique husband in the entire universe. In Jeremiah 31:32 the Lord considered that He was a husband to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. Isaiah told the children of Israel that their maker was their husband (Isa. 54:5).</p>
<p>In the New Testament we find the same thing. In John 3:29 John the Baptist indicated that Christ was the Bridegroom. Paul continued this thought in 2 Corinthians 11:2 where he said that he had betrothed the Corinthian believers to one husband, to present them a pure virgin to Christ. And in Ephesians 5 he likened Christ as the husband and the church as the wife. Finally, at the end of the Bible in Revelation 19:7 there is the marriage of the Lamb whose wife has made herself ready. The church as the Bride will be married to Christ as the Bridegroom. This tells us that unless man becomes God&rsquo;s wife, God is alone. For the Bible to say that it was not good for man to be alone implies also that it was not good for God to remain alone. God needed a counterpart, a wife.</p>
<p>The first two chapters of the Bible reveal that God was planning to have a Bride which would bear His image. After God created Adam, He brought all the animals to him and Adam named them, but he did not find among them a counterpart. So God caused him to sleep and took a piece of rib from his side. Genesis 2:22 tells us that God builded a woman from that piece of bone. When he looked at the woman he saw that she resembled him and bore his image, so he said, &ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man&rdquo; (Gen. 2:23). Adam then took her to be his counterpart. This is a picture of what God wants for Himself. It was for this purpose that God created man: to bear His image, to resemble Him in order to be His counterpart.</p>
<p>For such a one to be produced, there was a need to have God&rsquo;s divine life. This is why in Genesis 1 and 2, after God had created man in His image, He brought him to the tree of life. This indicated that although man had God&rsquo;s image, man did not have God&rsquo;s life. Man was like a photograph. A photograph may bear an image of a person, but it has no life. Adam was created like a photograph of God. He did not have the eternal, uncreated life, the life of God. This life was indicated by the tree of life. So God brought the man who did not yet have God&rsquo;s divine life to the tree of life so that he might eat of the tree of life. If Adam had eaten of the tree of life, he would have received God&rsquo;s life. Of course we know that Adam did not eat of the tree of life at that time. But nevertheless God&rsquo;s original intention was that the man who was created in His image should have God&rsquo;s divine life.</p>
<p>The picture in Genesis 2 is very wonderful! There is the tree of life, and near the tree of life there is a river flowing in four directions. With the flow of the river there is gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. Eventually in this picture there is also a bride. This picture, with the tree of life growing, with the river flowing, with the gold, the bdellium, the precious stones, and the bride, shows us that God&rsquo;s original intention is to have a Bride bearing His image, possessing His life, and transformed by the flow of life into precious materials to be built up as a Bride.</p>
<p>We all are Adam. As men we bear the image of God. As believers we also have the life of God. Furthermore, we have a river flowing within us. In John 7 the Lord indicated that whosoever drinks of Him would have the rivers of living water flowing out of his being. This means you bear the image of God, you have the divine life, and you have the flowing river within you. But are you gold, bdellium, onyx, or are you still muddy? If you say that you are now gold, bdellium, and onyx, your wife or those who serve with you may say that they have never seen them. They may say they have seen mostly mud. This is our problem, but God has such an intention. God will work this out by the way of His dispensation. God has an administration to distribute Himself into all of us.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 there are three categories of precious things. Why are there exactly three and not two or four? It is because God is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In typology, gold always signifies the nature of God the Father, bdellium signifies the produce of the overcoming death and life-secreting resurrection of God the Son, and the precious stones signify the issue of the transforming work of God the Spirit. How could we who are the muddy human beings be transformed? It is by God the Father&rsquo;s golden nature, by God the Son&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and by God the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work. If I ask whether you are gold, bdellium, onyx stone or mud, it would be hard for you to answer because you are in between. You are the mud with a little gold. You are the mud with some amount of bdellium. You are the mud with some amount of precious stone. But let me ask you: Don&rsquo;t you have God the Father&rsquo;s nature? Are you not in the death and resurrection of God the Son? Are you not under the transforming work of God the Spirit? To these questions you can boldly answer yes. You can even boast that although you are muddy you have God the Father&rsquo;s nature in you. You are in the death and resurrection of God the Son. You are under the transforming work of God the Spirit. We are all under the transformation today. Hallelujah, we are the people under God&rsquo;s transformation! One day we will be fully transformed into the gold, bdellium, and precious stones. One day we will be the Bride constituted with these three precious elements to be ready (Rev. 19:7). This is God&rsquo;s original intention revealed in the first two chapters of the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION</h2>
<p>Now we come to the last two chapters of the Bible where we find the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s intention. God&rsquo;s intention will have a consummation, which will be the New Jerusalem, the consummate tabernacle of God as His Bride (Rev. 21:2-3), bearing His glorious image to express Him (Rev. 21:11). In that consummation, there is no more mud, no more dust. The New Jerusalem is built of gold, pearl, and precious stones (Rev. 21:18-21). All the dust and mud have been transformed. In Revelation we can see the same things as in Genesis&mdash;gold, pearls, and precious stones. The only difference is this: the bdellium in Genesis 2 is a kind of resin, a gum congealed into a plant pearl. This means it is a kind of pearl which comes from the produce of the plant. But the pearls in Revelation 21 are pearls from the animal oyster. In Genesis it came from the plant, and in Revelation it will come from the produce of the animal. Plant life in the Bible signifies the producing life of Christ, and animal life signifies the redeeming life of Christ. In Genesis 2 there was no fall of man and no sin, so there was no need of redeeming. But in Revelation after the fall and after sin had entered there was the need of the redeeming life of the animal. That is the significance of the death and resurrection of God the Son.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem will be built up with God the Father&rsquo;s divine nature, with God the Son&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and with God the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation. That will be the universal Bride to satisfy God&rsquo;s desire for His eternal expression. This is the consummation of God&rsquo;s intention. In the first two chapters of the Bible there is God&rsquo;s intention, and in the last two chapters of the Bible there is the consummation of God&rsquo;s intention. Both sections show you the goal of God&rsquo;s dispensation, a Bride to be His counterpart, His expression. God&rsquo;s dispensation began from Adam and has been going on through all the generations. It will consummate in the New Jerusalem where we can see the goal of God&rsquo;s dispensation. Today we need to contact the Triune God to be supplied and nourished with the divine life as the river of water of life and as the tree of life (Rev. 22:1-2), that we might be transformed with the Father&rsquo;s golden nature through the Son&rsquo;s death and resurrection and by the work of God the Spirit. We need to cooperate with the Triune God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING REVEALED<br />
IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PATRIARCHS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3:15, 20, 21; 4:4, 26; 5:22, 24; 6:9, 14; 7:7; 12:1; 26:4; 28:12-14, 16-19; 32:28; 41:40-41</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that You are the speaking God. You have spoken through all the generations. We worship You that You are still speaking today. How we thank You for all the divine provisions for Your speaking! Thank You that You have an oracle of all Your saints on this earth. You have given us the blood, the Spirit, and the Word. Lord, how much we trust in You. We trust in Your cleansing blood and Your anointing Spirit and Your enlightening Word. How good that we are all sitting around Your Word, even around Yourself! Lord, do visit us, and anoint every attendant. Anoint the hearts, the minds, and the spirits. Anoint the speaking and the listening. Lord, be with us throughout the meeting. Lord, meet every need. Lord, even meet Your need through the speaking. Reveal Yourself to us, and take away all the veils. Remove all the coverings that we may have a clear sky above us. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Amen.</p>
<p>We need a central view of God&rsquo;s divine dispensation. Some Bible teachers in the past have pointed out that there are seven dispensations revealed in the Bible. The first is the dispensation of innocence, which was before Adam&rsquo;s fall. The second is the dispensation of conscience, which is after the fall and to the time of Noah. The third dispensation is that of human government, which was from Noah to Abraham. The fourth is the dispensation of promise, which was from Abraham to Moses. These four dispensations are covered by one book, Genesis. The fifth dispensation is that of law, which covers the rest of the Old Testament from Exodus through Malachi. The sixth dispensation is that of grace, which covers almost the entire New Testament from John the Baptist to the second coming of Christ. The last dispensation, the seventh, is the dispensation of the kingdom, the one-thousand-year reign of Christ.</p>
<p>Although this teaching is right, they didn&rsquo;t point out clearly what is the ultimate goal of all these dispensations of God. These dispensations are steps of God&rsquo;s divine system and arrangement and administration. Of course, some might say that through all these dispensations God was working out His salvation. But we would ask, What is God&rsquo;s salvation? Is it just to forgive us our sins and just to bring us into heaven? Or is it something further? What is the goal of all these dispensations? What is God&rsquo;s goal in His full salvation?</p>
<p>The entire Bible consummates in the New Jerusalem. In the first two chapters of the Bible God clearly shows us that His intention is to have a Bride bearing His image, possessing His life, and being transformed and built up as a Bride to match Him, to satisfy Him, and to express Him. God&rsquo;s eternal intention is not just to save a group of sinners and bring them into heaven, but to have a glorious Bride to be His counterpart to match Him. How He is, this Bride should also be. This Bride will be a match to the Triune God for His expression. This is much, much greater than forgiveness of sin or going to heaven. This is to make all of us a part of God just like a wife is a part of her husband. God is going to reach His goal through all the dispensations and complete His work of making us His counterpart. He began to work in Genesis 3, and He works through the entire Old Testament and the New Testament to reach His goal, the New Jerusalem. God&rsquo;s goal is a city which will be His Bride. The entire city of the New Jerusalem will be a Bride. It will be a corporate Bride bearing His glorious image to express Him, built up with God the Father&rsquo;s nature, through God the Son&rsquo;s death and resurrection, and by God the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation. This city will be nourished and supplied and fed all the time with the divine life signified by the river of water of life and the tree of life. Then in the entire universe there will be such an organism to match God, to be His Bride, His counterpart, to satisfy Him and express Him. This is God&rsquo;s goal in His dispensations, and today the proper church life is just a miniature of this Bride. Hallelujah for such a goal!</p>
<p>In this message we want to look at the book of Genesis from a bird&rsquo;s eye view. If you have such a view of Genesis you will realize that it is composed of eight great persons with an annex. There are Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, and Noah. There are also Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph as an annex to Jacob. In our life-study on Genesis we pointed out that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob depict one complete person with Joseph as an annex. So there are two groups and a total of nine great men as landmarks of the human race.</p><h2 class="head1">ADAM</h2>
<p>The first great landmark of the human race was Adam, who fell away from God. We should not forget that he was the first generation of mankind. He was the father of all of us, and he was made in the image of God. God intended that Adam would take the divine life into himself, and that he would have the flowing of the river within him to be transformed into gold, bdellium, and onyx stone for the building up of a bride. But he got fallen away from God, in other words he lost God. That was a real loss. If you lose God, you lose everything. In Genesis 2 God charged him to be careful about his eating. There were two categories of food. One would issue in life, and the other in death. And Adam ate the wrong one. After eating the wrong tree, he realized that he was about to die. That threatened him so he kept himself away from God&rsquo;s presence and hid himself under a covering.</p>
<p>But God is eternal, and He would never give up His intention. After man&rsquo;s fall God came in to find Adam. The first word that God spoke to fallen man was, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; (Gen. 3:9). After God found Adam He gave him a promise that the seed of woman would bruise the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15). Such a word to them was the gospel! That was good news, because after Eve and Adam had eaten of the wrong tree, they were scared and prepared to die. They thought that their destiny was nothing but death. But God spoke to them about the seed. The seed indicates life-giving. Instead of death, life was there. So this was good news! This was the gospel! This was the first preaching of the gospel in the entire universe. This gospel preaching was concerning Christ being the seed of woman. Eventually Christ came through a virgin. He was the Son of a virgin. The Son of a virgin is just the seed of the woman. Surely Eve and Adam were scared and they hated that serpent, so God promised them that the seed of woman would bruise the head of the serpent. Hallelujah for such a gospel! We know that Adam believed this gospel because he called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve, indicating she would be the mother of all who live (Gen. 3:20). That was the strong sign that Adam believed in God&rsquo;s promise as the gospel. Adam believed, and God also did something. He made a coat of the skin of an animal sacrifice to cover Adam (Gen. 3:21). We know that the coat of the skin of the sacrifice was a type of Christ being our righteousness. So in the first great landmark of human history, Adam, you can see the fall of man, the gospel, and redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABEL</h2>
<p>From Adam we go on to Abel. Revelation with all of these great men was progressive. It was advancing from one level to another level until it reached the top. Abel was the continuation of Adam. Adam was redeemed. Abel was not only redeemed, but also brought back to God, through the offering typifying Christ (Gen. 4:4). We too were not only redeemed, but also brought back to God to contact God and to fellowship with God. Abel&rsquo;s offering was not for sins. His offerings were for fellowship with God. Through these offerings, which were types of Christ, he was fully accepted by God. But he suffered the persecution, the martyrdom for God&rsquo;s testimony (Gen. 4:5-8). It is the same today. If we bear God&rsquo;s testimony that we can fellowship with God through Christ we will suffer the persecution.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENOSH</h2>
<p>From Abel we go on to Enosh. The word Enosh indicates a fragile man. I do believe that Seth, Enosh&rsquo;s father, realized that they were fragile men, so he named his son Enosh, meaning a fragile man. Enosh realized that he was weak and fragile, so he had no trust in himself. He called upon the name of Jehovah (v. 26). He did not call upon the name of God the Almighty, but upon the name of Jehovah, the Eternal One, the One who was, who is, and who will be, the One who is the great I Am. He is the great to be. In the entire universe everything is vanity. Everything is not to be. Everything is to vanish away. Only this Eternal One is to be; only He is. He is the reality. He exists forever. Yesterday, today, and forever, He is the same, without any change. He is the self-existing and ever-existing One. He is everything. Whatever you need, He is. His name is I Am.</p>
<p>In John 8 the Lord Jesus used the name, I Am, several times. In verse 24 He said, &ldquo;I said therefore to you that you shall die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am, you shall die in your sins.&rdquo; The Lord was saying, &ldquo;To get out of sin, you must believe that I am.&rdquo; In verse 58 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I say to you, before Abraham came into being, I am.&rdquo; The Lord is the great I Am. He is Jehovah.</p>
<p>In Genesis 4 Enosh realized that he was weak and fragile, so he called upon the name of this ever-existing One. This means that this fragile man did not live by himself. He lived by the ever-existing One. This is like saying, &ldquo;It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). Enosh lived, not by his fragile man, but by the great I Am, the ever-existing, eternal Lord. How did he live this life? It was by calling on this name. So you can see that to call upon the name of the Lord is an ancient matter. It is not our invention today. We are so weak, so fragile, so easy to be broken. Just a long face from our wife can put us down. Just one half sentence from our boy can break us. We are so fragile, we have no way to live, so we call upon His name. When we call upon Him, He lives for us! We are fragile, but He is so strong. So we call upon His name. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name makes us happy, strong, and even victorious. This was the landmark of Enosh. Hallelujah for such a landmark! In human history that was the landmark of one who called upon the name of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">ENOCH</h2>
<p>The revelation progresses further with Enoch. How good it is that in Enoch there is a man walking with Elohim (5:22). Elohim is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Without the Son to redeem us, to be our Redeemer, how could sinful man walk with God? How could the holy God who lives in unapproachable light come to walk with men? Hallelujah! In the Godhead there is not only the Father but also the Son who is our Redeemer. You may think that in Enoch&rsquo;s time the Lord Jesus had not been crucified. This is your view. This is not God&rsquo;s view. In Revelation 13:8 we are told that the Lamb of God was slain from the foundation of the world. This means that before you were born and before Enoch was born, in God&rsquo;s eyes Christ had died already. So the holy God was altogether free to come to a sinner through Christ, and a sinner like Enoch was free to walk with God. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful! Enoch had a companion, and God had a companion. They were walking together. What a wonderful thing that a man can walk with God!</p>
<p>Enoch went further than calling upon the name of Jehovah; he walked with God. Sisters, don&rsquo;t just call on the name of the Lord. After you call upon the name of the Lord you need to walk with the Lord. When you go to see your husband, the Lord Jesus needs to walk with you. What kind of life is this? This is the life under God&rsquo;s dispensing. It is by this that God can carry out His dispensation, dispensing Himself into man. In the Bible walking means to have your life, to have your being, to do things, to say things, to think things, to go anywhere. To walk with God is to have your life with God. This does not mean that God would be willing to go every place and to do everything with Enoch. Sometimes God would probably say no, that He would not go there, or that He would not do a certain thing. Suppose at that time Enoch would not go along with God. That would break their walking together. In our experience we realize this. Too many times we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, and the Lord Jesus comes to walk with us. But then we want to do something which He does not want to do. When we insist on doing our thing, this breaks the company, the walking together. After calling upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, you have to go with the Lord. Then the Lord would go with you. Don&rsquo;t ask Him to follow you; you have to follow Him. It is not that God walked with Enoch, but that Enoch walked with God. God did not live Enoch&rsquo;s life, but Enoch lived God&rsquo;s life. He was living a life that was God&rsquo;s life. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful!</p>
<p>Enoch not only walked with God, but also was taken away from death (Gen. 5:24). Genesis 5 is a record of death. It tells us that this one died, that one died, and another one died. Everyone was under death, but Enoch was kept from death. By walking with God day after day for three hundred years he was kept in everything away from the element and atmosphere of death. This kind of &ldquo;God-walking&rdquo; kept Enoch from death.</p>
<p>In principle today it is the same. Whenever we walk with the Lord and live with the Lord, at that time we are kept away from death. We all have experienced that if we don&rsquo;t walk with the Lord and live by the Lord, we are under death. Hallelujah! There is a living way to be kept away from the power and dominion of death. This is a part of God&rsquo;s dispensing. As we walk with Him, He is dispensing Himself into our being, so we are kept away from death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOAH</h2>
<p>From Enoch we go on to Noah. As a continuation of Enoch, Noah not only walked with God (6:9), but went further and worked with God according to God&rsquo;s salvation (Gen. 6:14). He was one in the same interest with God. At that time God was very much interested in building the ark. But God did not do it by Himself. He charged His co-worker, Noah, to build the ark for Him. So Noah worked with God. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are co-workers with God. What God is interested in, we are too. We have a common interest with God. Today the Lord is also building up an ark, the church life. God wants to build up the ark for His testimony. He would not do it by Himself directly. He would only build up the ark through the persons who are His co-workers. The co-workers of God must be co-walkers. If you do not walk with God, you can never work with God. Are you building up the local church? That is wonderful! But you have to walk with God. Only the co-walkers with God can do God&rsquo;s work. Noah was such a person. How good it is that Noah was a person who was not only fallen and redeemed, who was not only brought back to God, who not only called on the Lord&rsquo;s name, who not only lived by Him and walked with Him, but also worked with Him. He had a common interest with God.</p>
<p>Noah was not building something else. He was building the ark. The ark built by Noah was a type, not of a historical Christ, but of a present Christ. It is not a Christ far away from us, but a practical Christ. Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we are building up such a Christ. We are building up a practical and present Christ to be a salvation, not only to ourselves, but also to others. The local churches are building up the ark for the salvation of so many others, because we are now in a common interest with God.</p>
<p>What is salvation? It is God&rsquo;s dispensing in His dispensation. God carries out His dispensation that He might be dispensed into all His people. At least a little bit of the divine nature was dispensed into Adam. More was dispensed into Abel. Still more was dispensed into Enosh and into Enoch. A greater portion was dispensed into Noah so that he could become a co-worker of God. He could have a common interest with God. Are you not today&rsquo;s Noah? You have to say, Yes! Why? because first you got fallen, and then you got redeemed. Then you got brought back to God, and today you are calling on His name. You also are walking with Him and working with Him. What is your interest today? I have the assurance that deep within you there is the conviction that your interest today is common with God. Your interest is just God&rsquo;s interest. This is why you would forget about so many other things except the church life. You love the church life because God is for the church, and the church is God&rsquo;s interest. You are one with God, so His interest is your interest. This means you are today&rsquo;s Noah. Eventually Noah with his entire family entered into the ark, entered into what he had worked for God and with God (Gen. 7:7) to be kept away from the judgment of death-water. Today we should follow the same steps, not only to work with God, but to enter into what we have worked with God and for God, that we may enjoy the practical and present Christ and be kept away from the judgment of death.</p><h2 class="head1">ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND JACOB WITH JOSEPH</h2>
<p>Now we have to go on from Noah to this complete person composed with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph. With this complete person you can see more items. This complete person was called by God as the God of glory (Gen. 12:1; Acts 7:2-3; Heb. 11:8). And even before he was called, he was chosen by God (Rom. 9:11-13). We may not have such a realization of being chosen by God. We may only realize that we have been called by God. But before calling us God selected us. He considered us as His choice. When you go to the supermarket, you don&rsquo;t buy every item. You only buy your choice. God has selected us. We all are His choice. He loved us, and to His eyes we are the best. Hallelujah! God selected us! We did not select ourselves. We may reject ourselves, but He selected us and considered us as His choice. If He had not selected us we would not be here in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Acts 7 tells us that the very God who called Abraham appeared to him as the God of glory. Glory is the highest attraction. Look at the situation. Abraham was living in an idolatrous country with so many attractions. Suddenly the very God of glory came and called him out. The attraction to come out of that country was the very glory of God. That glory attracted Abraham.</p>
<p>So he was called by the God of glory. We all have been called by the God of glory. When you were called didn&rsquo;t you realize that the Lord Jesus was so lovable? This means Jesus is the Jesus of glory. If He were not of glory, how could He be so lovable? Then He charmed you and attracted you to Himself by His glory. In all of the church meetings there is a kind of charming by the Lord that He might draw us to Himself. Through all the generations the Lord Jesus has charmed and called so many people. All of us have been called by the God of glory, attracted by the divine glory.</p>
<p>Then Abraham received God&rsquo;s promise of the gospel with the Spirit as the blessing (Gen. 12:2-3; Gal. 3:8, 14). Galatians 3:8 tells us that what God spoke to Abraham in Genesis 12 was the preaching of the gospel. This is the second preaching of the gospel in the Scriptures. The first was in Genesis 3:15. The first preaching of the gospel was concerning the seed of the woman, and the second preaching of the gospel was concerning the seed of Abraham. This is the same seed. The seed of the woman is the seed of Abraham. The seed is Jesus Christ, the charming One. This is the center of the gospel. The blessing of this gospel is the Spirit. This charming Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit. This is why He is not only charming, but also prevailing. People might ask, Where is your Jesus? My Jesus is within me! He is the Spirit. He is prevailing. He is living, and He lives in me. Sometimes I can hardly bear His wonderful living within me. It is too wonderful! Hallelujah! This is the blessing of Abraham. The blessing of Abraham is just the life-giving Spirit (Gal. 3:14). When the life-giving Spirit comes to us, that is the Triune God reaching us. It is not a small thing for the life-giving Spirit to live in us. That means that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;all are here. Our Christ is living, and He is living within us. We have received such a gospel.</p>
<p>Not only have we received such a gospel, but we are also inheriting all the riches of God. The riches of God were typified by the rich produce of the good land which was inherited by Isaac (Gen. 25:5; 26:4; 28:13-14). This signifies that we who have received such a gospel inherit all the riches of God. It is too rich!</p>
<p>After this we need to see a vision. According to the record of the Bible after Isaac inherited all the riches, his continuation, Jacob, saw a vision in a dream. He saw the vision of Bethel, of God&rsquo;s house (Gen 28:12-13, 16-19). God made it clear to Jacob that what was on His heart was a house. Heaven is not God&rsquo;s house. God&rsquo;s house is His redeemed people. God wants His redeemed people to be His dwelling place, His house. According to Isaiah 66:1 and 2 heaven is God&rsquo;s throne, and the earth is His footstool. What then is His house? Isaiah tells us clearly that man is God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The heart of the contrite one is God&rsquo;s house. God does not desire to dwell in heaven. He wants to dwell in you and me in a corporate way.</p>
<p>God showed His heart&rsquo;s desire&mdash;to have Bethel, the house of God&mdash;to Jacob. We all need to have such a dream and to see such a vision. God wants a house, and today the church is God&rsquo;s house (1 Tim. 3:15).</p>
<p>When Jacob saw the dream, he was not yet transformed. He was still a supplanter, a heel-holder. On the one hand he saw the vision of Bethel, and on the other hand he was being transformed. One day God came in to change his name from supplanter to the prince of God, from Jacob to Israel (Gen. 32:28; 41:40-41). He was transformed into the prince of God to express Him and to reign for Him on the earth.</p>
<p>After Jacob&rsquo;s transformation, Joseph became a great steward to carry out God&rsquo;s dispensation, to distribute the riches of God to feed all the hungry people on the earth. All eight of these great persons plus Joseph actually depict one complete person.</p>
<p>Our experience can be fully seen in these nine great men. You are Adam, and you are Abel. You are Enosh, and you are Enoch. You are Noah. You are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph. Eventually you will be transformed. Today we are on the way to be transformed. In Adam we got fallen and redeemed. In Abel we were brought back to God and suffered persecution. In Enosh we called upon the name of the Lord and lived not by ourselves but by Him. In Enoch we walked with God. And in Noah we worked with God. In Abraham we were called out by the God of glory, and in Isaac we inherited all the riches of God. In Jacob the supplanter we saw God&rsquo;s choosing and the dream of God&rsquo;s house. How marvelous that even the supplanters are qualified to see the vision of God&rsquo;s house. In Israel we became the prince of God, and in Joseph we reigned to distribute the riches of God to the hungry ones. This is God&rsquo;s dispensation. By the time you come to Israel and Joseph, God has nearly been fully infused into man. This man became the prince of God. He became one with God to express Him and to reign for Him.</p>
<p>This is God&rsquo;s dispensing in His dispensation. God has dispensed Himself to carry out His dispensation. By this dispensing in His dispensation He could have a prince on this earth who was saturated with Himself. He could work Himself into His chosen people to express Him and to reign for Him. The end of Genesis shows us a prince of God, filled with God, saturated with God, one with God to express Him and to reign for Him. Here we can see the goal of God&rsquo;s dispensation&mdash;to make God&rsquo;s chosen people one with Him, bearing His image, possessing His life, and having the flow of life within to transform them into His glorious image to express Him and to reign for Him. Hallelujah for such a wonderful dispensing of God in His dispensation and its glorious goal!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING REVEALED<br />
IN THE EXPERIENCES<br />
OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 12:3, 7b-8a, 8b; 13:6-7; 16:14-15; John 6:51; Exo. 17:6; John 7:38-39; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Exo. 40:34-38; John 1:14; 1 Cor. 12:12; Heb. 9:2-5; Lev. 1:1-2a</h1>
<p>In the last message we saw something concerning God&rsquo;s dispensing in the book of Genesis. That part of God&rsquo;s dispensing was from Adam through Joseph. Let us spend some time to see how the divine dispensing progressed in Genesis. In Adam there was just a little of the dispensing. There was the receiving of the promise of the gospel related to the seed of woman (3:15). Then Adam was covered by the skin of the sacrifice (3:21). That indicates that Adam participated a little bit in Christ&rsquo;s redemption. From Adam God&rsquo;s dispensing progressed to Abel. In Abel we can see more of the dispensing of God. After being redeemed he was brought back to God and into the divine fellowship with God (4:4), and he suffered martyrdom for God&rsquo;s testimony (4:5-8). The dispensing continued with Enosh who began to call upon the name of the Lord, the Eternal One (4:26). He enjoyed the very sustaining life of the eternal life. He began to live, not by his fragile nature, but by the eternally existing One.</p>
<p>From Enosh the dispensing of God went on to Enoch. Based upon all the dispensing into the past three persons, Enoch began to walk and to live with and in the Triune God (5:22), so that he was taken away from death (5:24). After Enoch came Noah, who not only walked and lived with God (6:9), but also worked together with God (6:14). He had both his living and his working in common with God. He worked with God and for God. What he worked on and entered into was just God&rsquo;s salvation, the ark (7:7). The ark was a type of the practical and present Christ. Many Christians only know a historical and distant Christ. But according to the picture we can see with Noah, we should have a present and practical Christ that we can enter into, not just a historical Christ nor a Christ of distance. And we should work together with God on Christ. Christ is our ark, and in the local churches we are building up this ark. It may sound strange to you to hear we should build up Christ. But look at Noah. He was building up the ark, and as today&rsquo;s Noahs, we also should build up Christ.</p>
<p>Today we are saved. But we still need to work on Christ. Noah also was saved before he began working on the ark. If he were not saved, how could he have been charged to work together with God? By the time God came and charged Noah to build the ark, he was already walking with God and in the eyes of God was a righteous man in that age (6:9). This indicates he was saved even before he began to build the ark. Since he was already saved, why did he need to build the ark? He needed further salvation from the corrupted world. Have you been saved? Do you realize that you need further salvation?</p>
<p>Paul told us in Philippians 2:12 that we need to be obedient and to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. Although we have been saved, we still need to work out our salvation. God&rsquo;s salvation is not so short or so brief or so simple. God&rsquo;s salvation has a long span. We have to enter into God&rsquo;s salvation and to go through from one end of God&rsquo;s salvation to the other end. Today we are in the passage of God&rsquo;s salvation. We have entered into this passage. Now we are going through this passage, and our going through is our working. While Noah was working to make the ark, he was passing through. The more he built the ark, the more he passed through God&rsquo;s salvation. Eventually he entered into what he worked out (7:7). Dear saints, the very Christ you are building up will become your future salvation. One day under God&rsquo;s sovereignty you will enter into the very Christ whom you have built up.</p>
<p>We can see other points in Noah also. We can see that the ark is Christ. Christ, of course, is the embodiment of the Triune God. When Noah entered into the ark, he entered into the embodiment of the Triune God. Not only did he enjoy God, but he also entered into the Triune God. In principle the children of Israel did the same thing. Noah built the ark, and the children of Israel built the tabernacle. Noah entered into what he had built, and the children of Israel also entered into the tabernacle they built. Just to have God as your enjoyment is not adequate. You must have God as your ark or as your tabernacle into which you can enter. This is why the New Testament tells us that we should abide in Christ (John 15:4-5). When Noah entered into the ark, he abode there; he dwelt there. When the children of Israel entered into the tabernacle, they also dwelt there.</p>
<p>If you work together with the Lord in your daily experience you surely build up something of Christ, and eventually you get into what you have built up, and you dwell in this Christ as your enjoyment. Then you abide in Christ. Many Christians realize that John 15 speaks of abiding in Christ, but not many know what it means to abide in Christ. First you need to build up Christ. If you don&rsquo;t build up Christ, you have no Christ to abide in. Doctrinally this may sound strange, but experientially it is right. You have Christ, but do you abide in Christ? We may have Christ in doctrine and yet have no Christ in experience to abide in. Just to have Christ in doctrine means nothing. You need to have Christ in your experience. Just to believe in Christ is sufficient for you to have Him. But to abide in Christ needs some building up. You have to build up Christ for you to abide in Him. What does it mean to build up Christ? By your experience you know. You have to love Him. You have to talk to Him by calling on His name. You have to live by Him. You have to pass through all the experiences of Adam and Abel and Enosh and Enoch, and then you have to come to be Noah. Then you will have something built up.</p>
<p>If you spend from Monday through Saturday loving the Lord, fellowshipping with Him, living by Him, and walking together with Him, surely on the Lord&rsquo;s Day you would have the deep sensation that you are in Christ. You would have a practical and present Christ for you to abide in. But if, on the other hand, you spent from Monday through Saturday not loving the Lord and not fellowshipping with Him, not living in Him, and not walking with Him, even if you wanted to abide in Him today, you would feel that He is absent. In your experience He is not with you. You have Him in doctrine, but you don&rsquo;t have Him in experience. Although you might desire to abide in Him, it seems you don&rsquo;t know where He is. This would mean that for the past week you did not build Christ. You did not work on the ark. So when the flood came, you had no ark to enter into. But when you love Him and fellowship with Him and live by Him and walk with Him day after day and hour after hour, you build Him up in your experience. You build up a Christ in your experience for you to enter into as your salvation. We all need to build up Christ.</p>
<p>With Noah, God&rsquo;s dispensing reached a certain high point. But it was still not sufficient. So God went on from Noah to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph. When God&rsquo;s dispensing came to this complete person, God could get a house. The vessel came into view. This complete man could be transformed into a prince of God, a person absolutely one with God (Gen. 32:28). This complete person was able to express God. He could bear the name of God, and he could reign for God on this earth (Gen. 41:40-41). So at the end of Genesis there was a person who was one with God, bearing God&rsquo;s name, expressing God, and reigning with God and for God. Up to this point God had surely dispensed Himself a lot into His chosen people. This is wonderful. But at the end of Genesis, there was only an individual to contain and express God; there was no house of God. God had only gained one complete person.</p>
<p>God desired a corporate person, a house. So after Genesis there is Exodus. In Exodus God gained a house. At the end of Genesis God gained a complete person expressing Himself, but at the end of Exodus God gained a tabernacle representing a corporate people expressing God. At the end of Genesis is an individual Israel, but at the end of Exodus is a corporate Israel. There is a collective people of Israel to be God&rsquo;s tabernacle. This tabernacle was Bethel, the house of God. By that time God had infused Himself into His people to make them His dwelling. Up to that point God was in the tabernacle because He had infused Himself into His people in a more complete way.</p><h2 class="head1">SAVED BY THE LAMB&mdash;THE REDEEMING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In this message we need to see how God could reach such a point in His dispensing. First of all the people of Israel got saved by the Lamb of God who typified the redeeming Christ (Exo. 12:3). Don&rsquo;t forget that the Lord Jesus Christ is the very embodiment of God. The Lamb of God is the embodiment of the Triune God. John 1 says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God. This Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (vv. 1, 14). This very One is the Lamb of God (John 1:29). How wonderful! We have the Word, God, the flesh, the tabernacle, and the Lamb. The Lamb is the totality of the eternal Word of God in the beginning, of the flesh, and of the tabernacle. We all have been saved by such a Lamb who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTAKING OF THE LAMB&mdash;THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST</h2>
<p>We have not only been saved, but we are also partaking of the Lamb. It is not a matter of just being saved by Christ, but also a matter of partaking of Christ. To partake of Christ means to eat Him. A number of times in John 6 the Lord indicated that we should eat Him. (vv. 35, 50, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58).</p>
<p>When the children of Israel received the passover they struck the blood of the lamb and were saved (Exo. 12:7). Following that they ate the meat of the lamb (Exo. 12:7b-8a). Through their eating the redeeming Lamb got into them, and eventually the redeeming Lamb became them. This is why they were so strong and vigorous and bold to walk out of Egypt. They were full of energy. To be full of energy means to be full of the Lamb. Today many Christians have been saved by Christ, but they have remained so weak and not vigorous. Why? Because they have not partaken of Christ. They have not eaten Christ. How about you? You must be vigorous! How can you be vigorous? By partaking of Christ. By partaking of the Lamb. You have to eat the Lamb. The Lamb whom we can eat is the crucified Christ. Through His crucifixion Christ was &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; so that we may eat Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTAKING OF THE UNLEAVENED BREAD&mdash;<br />
THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2>
<p>At the Passover the Israelites also ate unleavened bread made of barley or wheat (Exo. 12:8b; 13:6-7). Barley or wheat bread is produced from grains which have passed through death and entered into resurrection. The unleavened bread typifies the resurrected Christ. Christ was not only crucified, but also resurrected. He was crucified to be our Lamb, and He was resurrected to be the unleavened bread. We have to enjoy the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Why, since they had eaten the Lamb, did they still need to eat unleavened bread? Let me illustrate in this way. After you were saved you partook of the crucified Christ, and He became your inner energy to give you the strength and boldness to walk out of the world. But you were not so strong to overcome sin. You were very vigorous to walk out of this world, but you could not overcome your temper or your besetting sin. You had the strength to get out of the world, but you did not have the power to overcome the sinful things. I have seen many dear Christians who got out of the world, yet who were still beset by sin. They couldn&rsquo;t overcome their temper. They couldn&rsquo;t overcome their lust. They were beset by certain sins. They needed the unleavened bread. This is bread that has nothing to do with sin. It is the bread that overcomes sin. This is the resurrected Christ. When the resurrected Christ becomes your food in your experience, this resurrection life overcomes sin. He that is born of God does not sin (1 John 3:9). What is it to be born of God? That is to have the resurrection life. Only the resurrected Christ is the life that overcomes sin. When you live on this unleavened bread, you will live a life without leaven. Eating the Lamb enables you to walk out of Egypt, but it is unleavened bread that enables you to live a life without leaven. To get out of the world you need the crucified Christ. This is why Paul could say that to him the world was crucified, and to the world he was crucified (Gal. 6:14). This is the experience of the crucified Christ. But for us to live in newness of life without any leaven, we need the resurrected Christ. We need the unleavened bread.</p><h2 class="head1">PARTAKING OF MANNA&mdash;THE HEAVENLY CHRIST</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel got into the wilderness, they ate manna (Exo. 16:14-15; John 6:51). Manna was a kind of heavenly food which rained from heaven. It did not come from this earth. That was a type of the ascended Christ. The Christ in the heavens comes to us all the day long as the heavenly food. First you enjoy the redeeming Christ, and then the crucified Christ. Afterwards you enjoy the resurrected Christ and eventually the ascended Christ. The redeeming Christ redeems you. The crucified Christ energizes you to get out of Egypt. The resurrected Christ enables you to live a life without sin. And the ascended Christ becomes your daily supply to keep you living every day. This is the Christ who is in the heavens, and yet who also comes into you every day. We all have this kind of experience. Every morning when we spend a few minutes with the Lord, we do have the sensation that Christ in the heavens is raining upon us. We pick up the manna to eat. Manna is the ascended Christ in the heavens raining to us for our daily supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTAKING OF THE LIVING WATER<br />
FLOWING OUT OF THE CLEFT ROCK&mdash;<br />
THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the wilderness the children of Israel needed manna for food, but they also needed something to drink. So there was living water flowing out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6; John 7:38-39; 1 Cor. 15:45b). This signifies the pneumatic Christ, the very Christ who is the Spirit. So you have the redeeming Christ, the crucified Christ, the resurrected Christ, and the Christ in ascension. Such a Christ became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This is the pneumatic Christ. This pneumatic Christ becomes our drink, our living water, which quenches our thirst. In Exodus we have to see the redeeming Christ, the crucified Christ, the resurrected Christ, the Christ of ascension, and the pneumatic Christ. Hallelujah, this is our Christ! Such a Christ is for the building up of the tabernacle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTAKING OF THE TABERNACLE<br />
(WITH THE OFFERINGS)&mdash;THE CORPORATE CHRIST&mdash;<br />
CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>After experiencing the Passover, eating of the heavenly manna, and drinking of the living water, the children of Israel arrived at Mount Sinai. Today due to the background, many Christians don&rsquo;t like the word Sinai because that was where the law was given. The law was given on Mount Sinai, but the law was only a part of what was given. There the design of God&rsquo;s dwelling place was also given. The children of Israel built up a tabernacle. The law as God&rsquo;s testimony was just a little part within the tabernacle. Eventually those people who were redeemed, who partook of the lamb and the unleavened bread, the manna and the living water also partook of the riches of the tabernacle with the offerings, which typified the corporate Christ, that is, Christ and the church (Exo. 40:34-38; John 1:14; 1 Cor. 12:12). The tabernacle is too rich.</p>
<p>Not only did they take part of the tabernacle itself, but the tabernacle with all the offerings. Look at the riches of all the offerings, and look at the riches within the tabernacle. Both inside and outside of the tabernacle were many riches. Outside of the tabernacle on the altar there was the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the free will offering, the wave offering, and the heave offering. All these are different aspects of the riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Yet all these riches are outside of the tabernacle. After enjoying all these riches outside on the altar, we need to enter into the tabernacle to enjoy the riches within the tabernacle. Within the tabernacle there was the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark. Within the ark there were further riches. Within the ark there was the law as the testimony of God, there was the hidden manna within the golden pot, and there was the budding rod of Aaron. My, what riches! All these items are the riches which God is dispensing into us in His dispensation.</p>
<p>By enjoying Christ as all the offerings outside of the tabernacle, you are able to enter into the tabernacle. Today the tabernacle is the proper church life. Within the tabernacle, that is, within the church life there is bread on the table. This is much better than manna. Upon the table are rows upon rows of bread. This is Christ to be your life supply. This is much richer than manna. Then there is the lampstand with the light shining. This light is the light of life (John 1:4). First you enjoy Christ as your life supply, your daily food. Out of this enjoyment you receive light. The more you enjoy Christ as life, the more you have the shining of the light. In the tabernacle Christ shines, not just by one lamp, but by seven lamps. And these seven lamps are the seven eyes of the Lamb. The seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven lamps before the throne of God. These are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5; 5:6). In the church life we have the rich enjoyment of Christ on the table. Out of this rich enjoyment of Christ, we have the seven Spirits of God shining. The lampstand comes out of the showbread table. First comes the bread and then the light.</p>
<p>After the light comes the ark as God&rsquo;s testimony. In the ark there is the deeper enjoyment. The hidden manna is there. In Revelation 2 the Lord promised the overcomers that they would eat of the hidden manna (v. 17). This is not the public manna under the sky, but the manna hidden in the golden pot. The hidden manna is concealed within the golden pot, the golden pot is concealed within the ark, and the ark is concealed within the tabernacle. There are three layers of concealing. How deep is this hidden manna! Some Christians today enjoy the manna under the sky. A few enjoy the bread in the Holy Place. It is the overcomers, the saints who seek after the Lord to the uttermost, who enter into the Holy of Holies and even into the golden pot where they enjoy Christ as the hidden manna.</p>
<p>Here there is such a deep enjoyment of Christ to strengthen you to bear the testimony of God. The testimony of Jesus is quite requiring and quite demanding. Sometimes you may consider that in the local churches the demand is too high, and you cannot fulfill it. But right by the side of such a testimony there is a golden pot, that is, the divine nature, holding the hidden Christ for your enjoyment. You don&rsquo;t need to fulfill the requirement of the testimony by yourself. The hidden Christ in the divine nature affords you the hidden manna to strengthen you to fulfill the testimony.</p>
<p>When you enjoy the hidden Christ in such a deep way there will be the budding. What does it mean to bud? It is to blossom, to spread the resurrection life. Then there will be the glorification. The budding, the blossoming, is just the glorification.</p>
<p>Up to this point, dear saints, God would be dispensed into His chosen people to the uttermost. We all need to see this. This is God&rsquo;s dispensing in His dispensation. I love the dispensation, but without the dispensing the dispensation means nothing. We need the dispensing of God Himself in His dispensation. Throughout all the centuries God has been carrying out His dispensation to dispense Himself into us. We don&rsquo;t want simply to learn about His dispensation; we want to enjoy His dispensing, He Himself being dispensed into our being.</p>
<p>Then we would have the inner testimony, the hidden Christ. We would have the budding rod blossoming to express God. Up to this point the Triune God will have become one with His chosen people. Such a tabernacle becomes God&rsquo;s oracle where we can enjoy God&rsquo;s speaking. The local churches are God&rsquo;s oracle where God&rsquo;s speaking is going on every day. In Christianity you can hardly hear God&rsquo;s voice, but in the recovery the Lord has an oracle. This is the church life. It is the place for God to speak. Immediately after the tabernacle was completed in Exodus 40, the Lord called unto Moses and spoke to him out of the tabernacle (Lev. 1:1). Today the tabernacle is the proper church life where there is a kind of infusing with God&rsquo;s constant and instant speaking. We enjoy His constant speaking, and His speaking always brings us His presence. This is the blessing of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>At the end of the book of Exodus there is the tabernacle as a corporate expression. When the tabernacle was completed, the glory of the Lord descended, overshadowed the tabernacle, and filled it up (40:34-35). That was a corporate people mingled with the glorious God. The tabernacle was a symbol of the people of Israel. Actually it was not the tabernacle made of wood and other materials that was God&rsquo;s dwelling place. That tabernacle was only a symbol that the children of Israel were God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>When God&rsquo;s glory descended, overshadowed, and filled the tabernacle, it was a symbol that the entire people of Israel were mingled with God&rsquo;s glory and enjoyed that glory. Many times in our meetings we too have the sensation that God&rsquo;s glory is overshadowing and filling us. The hall is filled with glory, and we are under the saturation of the glory. This is God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>This kind of infusing glory is also God&rsquo;s leading. Exodus 40 tells us that the glory upon and within the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s leading to the children of Israel. When the cloud of glory was taken up, they went onward. When the cloud of glory was not taken up, they did not journey (Exo. 40:36-38). The leading was just the glory of Jehovah. Today the Lord&rsquo;s leading is His glory with the church. The best way to be clear what you should do or where you should go is to enjoy the glory in the church. In the church God&rsquo;s glory breaks and you have a &ldquo;highway&rdquo; to travel on. You are so clear about your future, your destiny, your human life. The best place to be is on the highway of the church life. The best thing to do is to carry the church life. Our leading and our guidance is just the glory of the Lord, overshadowing and filling up the church life. As long as you are kept in the church life, you are in the Lord&rsquo;s leading, and you are on the highway of God&rsquo;s purpose. Here you enjoy the tabernacle with all its riches.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING REVEALED<br />
IN THE EXPERIENCES<br />
OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 7:13; 8:7-10; 11:9-12, 14-15; 32:13-14; 33:28; Num. 14:7-8; Eph. 3:8; 1 Kings 8:10-11; Eph. 1:22-23; Psa. 84:4, 10; 132:14-16; 36:8-9; 52:8; 92:13-14</h1>
<p>In the past two messages we have seen the central view of the divine dispensation in the books of Genesis and Exodus. In this message we want to see God&rsquo;s dispensing through the rest of the books of the Old Testament, from Leviticus to Malachi. If you have a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of these books you can realize that there are mainly three things: first, the enjoyment of the riches of the good land; second, the building up of the temple; third, the enjoyment of and in the temple.</p>
<p>At the end of Exodus there was a glorious situation. There was a corporate people who were God&rsquo;s dwelling place. They were overshadowed and filled up with God&rsquo;s glory. There were a lot of riches in the tabernacle for them to enjoy. But this enjoyment was not in the fullest way, so after Exodus the children of Israel were brought into the good land. Although they wandered for thirty-eight years, eventually, from Mount Sinai, they arrived at Canaan. They entered into the good land.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PARTAKING OF THE PRODUCE OF THE GOOD LAND&mdash;THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The produce of the good land was a type of the unsearchable riches of Christ (Deut. 8:7-10; 11:11-12; Eph. 3:8). First of all, in the good land there was a lot of rain and dew (Deut. 11:11, 14; 33:28). There was the early rain in the fall and the latter rain in the spring. Every day there was the dew. The rain is something strong, but the dew is very soft. Sometimes we cannot stand the strong rain. In typology, rain signifies God&rsquo;s strong and rich grace, and dew signifies God&rsquo;s soft mercy. Jeremiah told us that the mercy of the Lord is like the dew: every morning it is fresh (Lam. 3:22-23). We all realize that we need the rain; without rain we will die. But when the rain comes, we may not like it. Many times when the rain of grace comes, we are frightened by it. We like the soft dew. In the good land there is both the rain and the dew.</p>
<p>When the good land, due to the failure of the children of Israel, was cursed, the rain stopped and the entire land of Canaan became a scorched and dry land. Today&rsquo;s situation among the Christians has also become a scorched and dry land, with very little rain and nearly no dew. But in the recovery the rain comes quite often, and every morning the dew comes! We enjoy the dew every morning so fresh and so refreshing.</p>
<p>In the good land there are a lot of hills and valleys (Deut. 8:7b; cf. 2 Cor. 6:8-10). Some of the older generation might prefer a plain rather than hills and valleys. The hills are hard to climb, and the valleys are dangerous to descend, but we need the hills and the valleys. All the time we have to go up, and we have to come down. We shouldn&rsquo;t live on the plain. Every hill is the Lord Christ. Christ is our high hill, and Christ is also our deep valley. Sometimes we are on the high hill with Christ, and sometimes we are down in the deep valley with Christ. The church life should be full of hills and valleys. We don&rsquo;t like to go through the valleys, but if there are no valleys, there are no hills. The hills take away the earth from the valleys. If you don&rsquo;t have the hills, you don&rsquo;t have the valleys. If you don&rsquo;t have the valleys there is no place to keep the water. In the valleys there is plenty of water.</p>
<p>After the hills and valleys we have brooks of water, springs, and deep waters (Deut. 8:7a; John 4:14; 7:37-39). These are symbols of the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is the spring. When it flows it is a brook; when it stays in a certain place it becomes the deep water. The spring is the source, the brook is the course, and the deep water is like a big lake. These are different aspects of the life-giving Spirit. All these items&mdash;rain and dew, hills and valleys, springs, brooks, and deep waters&mdash;bring forth the riches of all kinds of produce.</p>
<p>There is the wheat and barley, the plentitude of food, without scarceness, not lacking anything (Deut. 8:8-9). There are also trees&mdash;the vine trees for producing wine, the olive trees for producing oil, the fig trees for feeding people, and the pomegranates signifying all the riches of life (Deut. 8:8b). Then there is grass forming the pastures where the cattle live and produce milk and meat (Deut.). Even the bees live on blossoms that produce honey. The good land is a land flowing with milk and honey (Deut. 11:9; 32:13-14). Both milk and honey are the produce of two kinds of lives. Milk is produced by cattle which are living on plants. Honey is produced by bees which are living on blossoms. Both milk and honey are the produce of two kinds of lives&mdash;animal life and plant life. Without the animal life plus the plant life you cannot have milk, nor can you have honey. Christ&rsquo;s life is both the animal life and the plant life. As the Lamb of God (John 1:29), Christ is the animal life. As the grain of wheat Christ is the plant life (John 12:24). The animal life plus the plant life produces the milk and the honey.</p>
<p>From the olive tree is the olive oil, and from the vine there is the wine (Deut. 7:13; 8:8b). The oil is for giving light and for anointing. In the church life we have a lot of oil, a lot of the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is enlightening us and also anointing us. In the church life there is also the wine from the vine to cheer us up and to make us happy every day. On the day of Pentecost the disciples were considered drunken by others because they were so happy (Acts 2:13).</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 8:9 says that the land is a land &ldquo;whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.&rdquo; The stone and the iron are mixed up together. It is a piece of stone, but it is full of iron. Both the iron and the brass are for building and for fighting. David killed a giant just with a small piece of stone. In the ancient times nearly all the weapons were made either of iron or brass. In the church life we have not only the enjoyment of the wheat and barley, of the olive tree, the vine tree, the fig tree and the pomegranate tree, of the milk and honey, of the oil and wine for our living, but also of stones, iron, and brass for building and fighting. In the church life we need the stones full of iron and the brass for building and fighting. While we are enjoying we are building. While we are building we are fighting. In the book of Nehemiah the children of Israel were building with one hand and holding a weapon for fighting against the enemy with the other (Neh. 4:17). The good land is good for us to enjoy, for us to build, and for us to fight.</p>
<p>Christ is the good land. This is the all-inclusive Christ. After eating Him and being filled with Him we will give blessing to our God (Deut. 8:10). From the enjoyment of such a rich land an issue comes out. It issues in the building of the temple (1 Kings 8:10-11), which is much bigger than the tabernacle. Furthermore, it has a solid foundation. It is a solid building, full of stones, full of iron, full of brass, and full of gold. Once the tabernacle had been erected the glory of God descended upon it (Exo. 40:34-35), and at the completion of the building of the temple the same thing happened. The glory of Jehovah came down and filled the temple.</p>
<p>This was God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into His chosen people. This is the central point of God&rsquo;s dispensation. The focus of God&rsquo;s dispensation is just to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that He Himself becomes His chosen people&rsquo;s life and nature. This is to mingle His people&rsquo;s being with the divine being. This is humanity saturated with divinity. This is the universal Bethel, a house of God, built up with humanity on this earth.</p><h2 class="head1">PARTAKING OF THE TEMPLE&mdash;<br />
THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The book of Psalms is mainly a book of the enjoyment of the temple. When you read many of the Psalms you can realize that when the Psalmists talked about the temple they became very excited. To them the temple was so lovely. It was better to stay one day in the temple than a thousand days at other places (Psa. 84:10). What is the temple? Today the temple is the church life (Eph. 2:21-22), a building of humanity with divinity. This is why the church life is so lovable, so sweet, so beautiful, so wonderful, so marvelous, so glorious! When we come into the church life we have the sensation that it is better to be here for one day than to be some other place for a thousand days. Sometimes our relatives may condemn us, saying that we only care for the church life. We don&rsquo;t care for anything else. How marvelous! Eventually, though, some of the relatives also have come into the church life. The church life prevails! The church life convinces and subdues and wins. Nothing can stand against the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DWELLING OF BLESSING</h2>
<p>First of all the temple is a dwelling of blessing (Psa. 84:4, 10). Surely when we dwell in the church life we get the blessing. There is no curse and no loss in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S REST</h2>
<p>The temple is also God&rsquo;s rest that satisfies Him forever (Psa. 132:14-16). It is a place for God to rest. According to the Old Testament without the temple God had no place to rest. Although God had the heavens, God had no rest (Isa. 66:1-2). Religion talks about going to heaven. This thought of going to heaven is a pagan, heathen thought. In the Western World this thought was invented by gnosticism. In the Orient it came from Hinduism and Buddhism. All the Chinese who are Buddhist expect to go to the Western Heaven. This kind of pagan thought was adopted by Catholicism. From Catholicism it spread into Protestantism. God doesn&rsquo;t love heaven so much. He loves the earth. The Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Let Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth&rdquo; (Matt. 6:10). God expects to have something on this earth. His temple is not in the heavens; in the Old Testament His temple was on the earth. Today the church is His temple. God loves the church, the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15). The church is God&rsquo;s home. If you want to find God, come to the church. Although I may visit a foreign country, if the church is there, I am home, because the church is God&rsquo;s home and my home. The church is the resting place of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PLACE OF RICH PROVISION</h2>
<p>The church is also a place of rich provision for God&rsquo;s people (Psa. 132:14-16). In the church there is the rich supply of spiritual food and spiritual clothing. Nothing is short in the church. When you come to the church life and stay in the church life you get the supply. You get the rich provision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATISFYING GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE ABUNDANTLY</h2>
<p>With the temple there is also the satisfying of God&rsquo;s people abundantly with its fatness and with the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures, the fountain of life, and the divine light (Psa. 36:8-9). The church life has its fatness. It is so rich! Here in the temple, the church life, we drink of the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures. Pleasures in Hebrew is the plural form of the word Eden. This implies when you drink of the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures in the temple, your drinking brings you into Eden. When we are in the church life we are in Eden, the garden of pleasures.</p>
<p>Within the temple, the house of God, there is also the fountain of life and the divine light. All these are the enjoyment of the rich Christ in God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHERE GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE ARE PLANTED AND GROW</h2>
<p>The Psalmist goes on to tell us that we could be planted in the temple and that we could grow as a green olive tree in God&rsquo;s house, full of sap and fruit (Psa. 52:8; 92:13-14). Psalm 92:12-14 says that the people who are planted in God&rsquo;s house shall flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon, and shall still bring forth fruit in old age. All this portrays the enjoyment of Christ in the church life, and this is the result of God&rsquo;s dispensing Himself in Christ into our being. By such a dispensing even in our old age we can bring forth fruit, and we can be full of sap and green.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&#8217;S DISPENSING<br />
IN THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14; Matt. 1:23; John 1:17, 18; 14:9b-11a; 1:29; 12:31; 16:11; 3:14; 12:24; Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21</h1>
<p>In the Old Testament God&#8217;s dispensing in His dispensation consummated in the temple. In the temple was the glory of God, which was the leading of the Lord to His people. Within the temple were also the divine riches. The glory, the leading, and the divine riches were the result of God dispensing Himself into His people.</p>
<p>At this juncture I would like to make a clear distinction between the two words dispensation and dispensing. Because these two words are very similar, we might consider that they have the same meaning. Actually they are not the same. Dispensation means a plan or an arrangement, so it is a kind of management and administration. In His Word God has shown us that He has a plan (Eph. 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4). This plan is concerning His household. It is a kind of household plan or household arrangement. Or we may say it is a household management or a household administration. God has a big household, and in His household He has a plan. He has an arrangement to administrate His purpose. This is the meaning of the word dispensation.</p>
<p>In God&#8217;s plan, or arrangement, or dispensation, God intends to dispense Himself into His people. So dispensing means to distribute and to give. God is giving Himself and imparting Himself into His people. He is distributing Himself into His people for His people&#8217;s enjoyment. Most Christians today only consider that God redeems us, saves us, and gives us strength and power. Very few Christians have the thought that God is dispensing, distributing, and imparting Himself into His chosen people. Before 1950 even we ourselves did not talk about God dispensing Himself into us. It was only after 1950, within the last thirty years, that we began to see and to minister that God is dispensing Himself into our being. What we want to emphasize in these messages is not the dispensation but the dispensing.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate: A good kitchen may be set up with a good plan and good arrangement and good administration. But the plan is not for the plan. The arrangement is not for the arrangement. The kitchen is for dispensing food to the guests. If the guests come to the kitchen and simply admire the plan and arrangement and do not receive any food they would remain hungry. So in a sense we need to forget about the kitchen with its good arrangement. We need to take care of getting the food-the milk, the eggs, and the bread-dispensed into us. The central thing in the kitchen is not the arrangement but the food. The central view of God&#8217;s dispensation is just God Himself as our rich food dispensed into our being, as the Lord Jesus told us in John 6.</p>
<p>In a previous message I pointed out to you that a little bit of God was dispensed into Adam, and then a little more of God was dispensed into Abel. Still more of God was dispensed into Enosh and Enoch, and progressively more into Noah and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Eventually because of all the dispensing, the children of Israel came forth as a corporate dwelling place to God, and God became a dwelling place to them.</p>
<p>We also saw in the type of the good land all the unsearchable riches of Christ (Deut. 8:7-10; Eph. 3:8). Christ is the reality of all the riches typified there: the rain, the hills and valleys, the wheat and barley, the olive oil, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, the springs and brooks and deep waters, the iron stones and brass. And all these riches have been dispensed into His people. For example, whatever we eat for breakfast is dispensed into our being. God is dispensing Himself into us in this way. Our energy and the healthy color of our face come from the food being dispensed into our being. If you do not eat well you will be short of energy because no food has been dispensed into your being. Today God has been dispensing Himself into us. God planned and arranged to do this. This is God&#8217;s dispensation, God&#8217;s arrangement, for Him to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</p><h2 class="head1">TO BRING GOD INTO MAN THROUGH INCARNATION</h2>
<p>Now we want to come to the New Testament and see the central view concerning God&rsquo;s dispensing Himself into us. In the New Testament the first step of God&rsquo;s dispensing Himself into us is that He became incarnated (John 1:14a). The incarnation means that God is born into man. Before the incarnation God was God outside of man and even far away from man. But in incarnation God came to dispense Himself into humanity. When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, God was dispensed into humanity. Jesus was a real man with blood and flesh and skin and bone. When He was thirty years of age He came out to minister for three and one-half years. He was a real man, yet within Him was God. God was dispensed into that Man. This is Jesus our Savior.</p>
<p>Incarnation brings God into humanity to make humanity holy, and even to make humanity divine. Surely the Lord Jesus is divine and holy. In the same principle even we ourselves who are His believers are also holy and divine. We are divine, but we are not God. This is just like the children of a king. They are kingly, but they are not the king. They are kingly because they have the king&rsquo;s life. We are divine because we have a divine Father. We have been born of God (John 1:12-13). We possess His life (John 3:15) and partake of His nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Although we are not God, we are divine, because God&rsquo;s divine life and nature have been dispensed into our being. When a child is conceived and born, the father has dispensed his life and nature to the child. To be born of God means God dispenses His life and nature into our being. Because we are born of God we are not only holy but divine! The word holy may only denote the outward appearance, but divine denotes the inward nature. We are not just outwardly holy, but also inwardly divine. When you go to the department store don&rsquo;t forget that you are a child of God. You have a royal status. You are divine because God has been dispensed into you. Today we all have Christ, and Christ has wrought God into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE GOD&rsquo;S TABERNACLE AMONG MEN</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth He was the tabernacle of God among men (John 1:14b). Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful! The unapproachable, invisible, hidden, mysterious, and abstract God became solid, visible, touchable, and even enterable. This tabernacle is just God in humanity (Matt. 1:23).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was staying with the disciples, before His death and resurrection, all the disciples were around Him. They could see Him and touch Him, but at that time they could not enter into Him, because the way was not paved and the entrance was not opened. After the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the way was paved and the door was opened for all the disciples to enter into Him. The Lord Jesus had promised them that in that day, the day of resurrection, they would know that He was in His Father and they were in Him and He was in them (John 14:20). This is God dispensed into human beings. When the Lord Jesus was with the disciples before His death and resurrection, He Himself alone was divine. Peter, John, and James were not divine. But when the Lord Jesus breathed into them on the day of resurrection (John 20:22), He entered into them. They became divine because God had been dispensed into their being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BRING THE DIVINE GRACE<br />
AND REALITY TO MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus in His ministry brought the divine grace and reality to man (John 1:14c, 17). Grace is a big term in the New Testament. John 1:17 says that the law was given through Moses but that grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. Grace came when the Lord Jesus came. What is grace? Grace is a free gift. The real grace in the whole universe is just God given to us freely. It is not a good house or a good car or a good job given to us freely. All those things are considered by Paul as trash (Phil. 3:8). In the whole universe there is only One who is the real grace. That is our God. And God has given Himself to us freely. Before the Lord Jesus came, God had never been brought to man. But when the Lord Jesus came He brought God to us as a free gift. This is grace for our enjoyment. When you have Christ, you have God.</p>
<p>The Jewish people today have rejected Christ, yet they insist that they worship God. Actually they have God only in name and in term. They don&rsquo;t have a personal God within them. It is the same with the Moslems. They only have God in term and in name. They don&rsquo;t have God within them.</p>
<p>But we have the person of God within us as our daily enjoyment. He is our supply, our support, our food, and comfort. We daily enjoy Him as grace. Outside of the Lord Jesus you cannot have God. If you would meet God, you have to come to the Lord Jesus. God is here in the person of Jesus. The Lord Jesus has brought God to us as a free gift. After God has been dispensed into you and becomes your enjoyment, this is the real grace.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, reality also came. Reality is harder to illustrate. You have to realize that without God the entire universe is an empty shell. If you do not have God as the reality in your family, your family is empty. If you don&rsquo;t have God, you are empty. This is why King Solomon said that everything is vanity (Eccl. 1:14). Only God is reality. When we have God we not only have the enjoyment, but we also have the reality. Other things that we enjoy will vanish away. A good house will vanish away. A good car will vanish away. Money will vanish away. Only One will never vanish away. He will remain forever; He will exist forever, and He is the reality. He is the real enjoyment, and this enjoyment is the reality. The Lord Jesus came with the enjoyment and the reality. He has brought us grace and reality. Both grace and reality are God Himself dispensed into our being.</p><h2 class="head1">TO EXPRESS GOD</h2>
<p>Christ expresses God. No one has ever seen God, but Christ, who declared God, also expressed God (John 1:18; 14:9b-11a). When you see Him you see God. God is love, God is light, God is holy, and God is righteous. All these attributes of God can be seen in the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is love and light and holiness and righteousness because He is the expression of God for us to participate in God and so that God can dispense Himself into our being.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was born, and for the first thirty years He did not have any disciples. But during His last three and a half years He collected some disciples who were with Him. They had Him with them, but they did not have Him within them. This means that God still had not been dispensed into them. But He had collected them, and He had prepared them. Then He went to die and resurrected and came back to them as the Spirit. He breathed into them, and they all received the Spirit out of Him (John 20:22). At that time God began to be dispensed into all the disciples. The Lord Jesus had spent three and a half years to prepare the disciples to receive God into them as grace and reality. After that, God was infused and dispensed into them.</p>
<p>Many of us were like those disciples. I was in Christianity from my youth, but I never had gotten God dispensed into me. Until one day when I was nineteen the very God dispensed Himself into me. That made me different, and from that day onward I began to enjoy God as my grace and my reality. I did have something so sweet and so real. I enjoyed Him. I found He was so trustworthy and everlasting. He never disappeared. He was my grace, and He was my reality. This is God&rsquo;s dispensing Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO TAKE AWAY SIN FROM MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus prepared His disciples for three and one-half years, and then one day He went to the cross and died on the cross. His death on the cross was a complete preparation. By His death He paved the way and opened the door that His disciples might enter into God. How did He do this? First of all, on the cross through His death, He took away their sin (John 1:29). Sin is the main obstacle between man and God. If man would enter into God and God would dispense Himself into man, surely this obstacle of sin must be removed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO JUDGE THE WORLD THROUGH HIS CRUCIFIXION</h2>
<p>A second obstacle that the Lord dealt with on the cross is the world (John 12:31a). The entire world is a satanic system that distracts people and takes them away from God. For man to enter into God so that God may enter into man, the world has to be judged. Christ judged the world, Satan&rsquo;s satanic system, on the cross through His death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO DESTROY SATAN IN HIS FLESH</h2>
<p>A third obstacle that the Lord dealt with on the cross is God&rsquo;s enemy, the Devil or Satan (John 12:31b; 16:11). Through His death on the cross the Lord Jesus destroyed Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO DEAL WITH OUR SERPENTINE NATURE<br />
IN THE LIKENESS OF THE FLESH OF SIN</h2>
<p>Furthermore, our serpentine nature, that is, our sinful nature, the indwelling sin, was dealt with on the cross (Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21). Because we are fallen, we have a sinful nature which is serpentine. It is full of the poison of the old serpent, Satan. Every human being has the poison of the old serpent, so in the eyes of God every human being is serpentine. So, the Lord Jesus died on the cross as a brass serpent, that is, in the likeness of the flesh of sin (John 3:14), to deal with our serpentine nature.</p>
<p>So by the cross sin was taken away, the world was judged, Satan was destroyed, and our serpentine nature was dealt with. This means all the obstacles have been cleared away and the way has been paved. The veil has been opened (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:19-20). Now every disciple of Jesus is ready to enter into God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO RELEASE THE DIVINE LIFE THROUGH HIS DEATH</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross released His divine life (John 12:24). The divine life was in the Lord Jesus just like life is in a small seed. Every seed has life concealed within it. The seed must die in the earth in order for the life to be released. The divine life was concealed within the Lord Jesus. When He died on the cross, the divine life within Him was released. All the obstacles have been removed, and the divine life has been released, so everything is ready for us to enter into God and for God to enter into us that we might have the divine life dispensed into us. This is not only God&rsquo;s salvation, but also His dispensing. God has not only saved us, but also dispensed Himself into our being to make us the children of God, even to make us divine.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING<br />
IN THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 3:15; 10:10b; 2:19, 21; 1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:29; 14:16-20; 17:21-23; 20:22; 14:23, 26; 15:4a, 5a; 7:38-39; Rev. 22:1-2</h1>
<p>The ministry of Christ is the main ministry in the New Testament to dispense God into us. It is clearly of two parts: the first part is for Him to come to us, and the second part is for Him to go back to God. This is a two-way traffic, a traffic both coming and going. He came to bring God to us, and He went back to God to bring us into God. By this coming and going God has dispensed Himself into our being. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming began from His incarnation and ended with His crucifixion. From His incarnation to His death was the first part of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. The second part of His ministry began from His resurrection and has no ending, so it will last for eternity.</p>
<p>In the last message we pointed out that in the first part of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry He brought God into humanity, He was the tabernacle of God among men, He brought the divine grace and reality to us, and He expressed God in full. These items were the work of the Lord Jesus while He was on this earth. After accomplishing this work He went to the cross and was crucified. His death on the cross did much to enable God to dispense Himself into us. He died on the cross as the Lamb of God to take away our sin; He judged the satanic world; He destroyed Satan, the power of death, in His flesh; and He dealt with our serpentine nature. All these negative things have been annulled by Christ on the cross.</p>
<p>On the positive side the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross released the very divine life concealed within Him. Incarnation brought Him into confinement. His humanity was like a shell that confined His divine life within it. He likened Himself to a grain of wheat (John 12:24). A grain of wheat has a shell which confines the wheat life within it. The only way this confined life can be released is by death. When a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, the life within the shell is released. So on the negative side the Lord&rsquo;s death dealt with all the negative things, but on the positive side His death released His divine life. Crucifixion released Him as the divine life from His human shell. Both of these aspects of His death are so that God can dispense Himself into you and me.</p>
<p>This is the first part of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry. This is His coming from God to us through incarnation and death. If He had not gone through incarnation and death, God could never have reached us. God&rsquo;s dispensing reaches us through Christ&rsquo;s incarnation and death. All the negative things have been put away, and life has been released. Not only has life been released, but it has also been presented to us so that we may receive it by calling upon His name. This divine life is just the life-giving Spirit (Rom. 8:2), and the life-giving Spirit is just the Lord Jesus Himself (2 Cor. 3:17). So when we say, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; He as the air gets into us. When He gets into us, that is God dispensing Himself into us. This is wonderful!</p>
<p>Although this is marvelous, this is just one way. This is the way of Christ coming from God to us. The second way is Christ going from us back to God to bring us into God. This began from His resurrection and goes on in resurrection, not only for this age, but for eternity. We have to realize that since the Lord Jesus has gone through incarnation and death, He is now in resurrection. In typology resurrection was typified by the wave offering, something waving and moving (Lev. 23:10, 11, 15). In Revelation 1:18 the Lord Jesus said, I am &ldquo;the living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.&rdquo; Jesus Christ today is the living One, the One who is in resurrection.</p>
<p>First He was incarnated to be in the flesh; then He was put to death, but today He is in resurrection. If you sow a grain of wheat into the ground, it will die and grow up out of the earth. Where then is the grain of wheat? It is in resurrection. The Lord Jesus passed through death, and now in resurrection He has brought forth much fruit.</p><h2 class="head1">TO IMPART THE DIVINE LIFE INTO THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The first thing that the Lord Jesus does in resurrection is that He imparts His divine life into the believers (John 12:24; 3:15; 10:10b). Resurrection dispenses Him as life into His believers to make them His members. Through His death as a grain of wheat His life was released. When the Lord Jesus was walking and living on the earth He was like a grain of wheat. His life was not released because He was still not touched by death. The Lord Jesus knew that He would have to pass through death. This is why in Luke 12:50 He said, &ldquo;But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!&rdquo; Baptism in this verse refers to the death He had to go through. The divine life concealed and confined in His humanity could not be released except through His death. When Satan was causing the Lord Jesus to be crucified on the cross he was happy, but he didn&rsquo;t realize that actually he was helping the Lord Jesus to release the divine life within Him.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do to a grain of wheat is to bury it in the earth. This is why the Lord Jesus prayed, &ldquo;Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You&rdquo; (John 17:1). To sow the seed into the dirt is to glorify it. To the Lord Jesus, death was a wonderful release. When a grain of wheat rises up from the dirt, it brings forth many grains which are its manifestation, its glorification. Today we are the many grains of wheat which have come out of the glorification of Jesus. Our Jesus has been universally glorified. There are many grains all over the globe which have come out of the glorification of Jesus.</p>
<p>The life within the Lord Jesus, within the one grain, was released and imparted and dispensed into many grains. The many grains which come out of the glorification of one grain are exactly the same as the original grain. He was a grain, and now we have become grains. He was the unique grain, and we are the many grains. In life and nature there is no difference between the one grain and the many grains.</p>
<p>Even as the way to release the life within the Lord Jesus was through death, so the way for us to enjoy life is also through death. The more we experience the death of Christ, the more we will experience and enjoy His life.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries different people have tried to terminate the Christians by killing them. But killing never terminates the Christians. Rather, killing germinates many more Christians. When one Christian is martyred, many more are germinated. The more the Christians have been persecuted, the more they have multiplied. Martyrdom is a kind of glorification. In 1949 I left Mainland China. At that time there were only about three million Christians including the Catholics. Today there are thirty to forty million Christians. They have been increased more than tenfold.</p>
<p>Through the centuries Christ has been multiplied many times through death. After His first crucifixion, Christ has gone through many deaths within His believers. He was killed in the first century, in the second century, and in many following centuries. In the twentieth century He was killed many times in China. But through every killing, that is, through the martyrdom of the believers, Christ was glorified and multiplied. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of any kind of opposition. To us opposition is a glorification. The way of life is wonderful, but the way of life is through death. It is of life, but it is through death. The divine way of life is to go through death for multiplication. It is through death and resurrection that the divine life has been dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO RAISE UP THE DESTROYED TEMPLE</h2>
<p>Christ in His resurrection raised up the destroyed temple (John 2:19, 21; 1 Pet. 1:3). In John 2:19 the Lord Jesus told the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; The temple the Lord Jesus was referring to was the temple of His body. When He raised up the temple of His body from the dead, He raised up an enlarged temple including Himself as the Head and all of His members as the Body. As a member of the Body you were resurrected at the same time that the Lord Jesus was resurrected. Before you were born you were resurrected through the resurrection of Christ. The same principle applies to our being saved. We were regenerated nearly two thousand years ago when the Lord Jesus was resurrected from among the dead (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>Likewise, although the book of Revelation is a book of prophecy, many of the verbs are in the past tense. John said that he saw the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2). To us the New Jerusalem will come in the future, but to John&rsquo;s perspective it was there already. To our way of thinking the church will be built up, but in John&rsquo;s vision the church was already built up and the Bride had made herself ready (Rev. 21:2).</p>
<p>The Jews were used by Satan to destroy the fleshly body of the Lord Jesus by crucifying Him on the cross. In doing so they thought that they had terminated Him. They did not realize that they had helped the Lord Jesus to multiply. He was put to death in His physical body, but when He was raised up He not only had a physical body but also a mystical Body which is universally great. We all have been regenerated in the resurrection of Christ from among the dead. By His resurrection He has regenerated us. The resurrection life has been dispensed into our being. This regenerated people is the enlarged temple of God, and this is the universal church. Today in the church we are enjoying God&rsquo;s dispensing in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">TO HAVE THE BRIDE</h2>
<p>It is by God&rsquo;s dispensing in the resurrection of Jesus Christ that He obtains a Bride, a wife, composed of all the regenerated ones. The issue of regeneration in John 3 is a Bride to Christ (v. 29). Christ gained a Bride through God&rsquo;s dispensing. Regeneration in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection is just God dispensing Himself into you, and this dispensing issues in a Bride to Christ. Through regeneration all of us are a part of this Bride.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BRING HIS BELIEVERS INTO GOD</h2>
<p>Then Christ in His resurrection brought all His believers into God (John 14:16-20; 17:21). Where are you today? Do you realize that, as regenerated ones, you are in God? Whether I am in the U.S.A., or in Hong Kong, or in Stuttgart, my home is in God. This is not a superstition; this is a fact! This is a reality. Christ in resurrection has brought all of us into God through the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO ENTER INTO THE BELIEVERS AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christ brought us into God, and at the same time He entered into us as the Spirit (John 14:16-17; 20:22). Let us read John 14:20: &ldquo;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; In this verse it is hard to say who is in whom. We all are in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, so we also are in the Father. This means that we are in the Son and in the Father. And the Son is in us. This is God&rsquo;s dispensing. The dispensing of God has been neglected and missed among today&rsquo;s Christians. Today&rsquo;s Christians mostly stress the ethical teachings such as husbands love your wives, and wives submit yourselves to your husbands. But eventually no wife can give the proper submission, and no husband can give the proper love apart from God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not a matter of human love or submission. It is a matter of the living God dispensing Himself into us. When, as a husband, you have the living God dispensed into you, surely you will love your wife. When, as a wife, you have the living God dispensed into you, surely you will submit to your husband. This will not be simply your loving or your submitting; this will be Christ living in you. This will not be a matter of ethics or religion, but of the living God entering into you as the Spirit. This is to be merged in God and to have God merged in you. This is to be blended with God. This is God&rsquo;s dispensing. This is the Lord Jesus&rsquo; ministry, the real salvation.</p>
<p>Today among most Christians what is taught is mostly ethical teachings. People are mainly taught to improve their character and behavior. This is just ethics; this is not the living Christ in resurrection. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are not teaching people mere ethics. We are ministering Christ in resurrection who is the very God being dispensed into all of us. We are not living merely an ethical life; we are living a life that is God Himself. Christianity has become mostly an ethical religion, but the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the living God dispensing Himself into all His chosen people. Our ethics and our morality by the living God are on a much higher level because they are just God Himself living in us and through us and from within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO ABIDE IN THE BELIEVERS WITH THE FATHER<br />
THROUGH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>After entering into His disciples Christ abides in them with the Father through the Spirit (John 14:23, 26; 15:4a, 5a). He does not only enter into us; He also abides in us for eternity. You need to have the realization that you have the living God now abiding in you. The very Christ in resurrection lives in you. If you really see this you could not be so silent. Anyone who realizes that the living God is abiding in him would be excited. This is not a doctrinal Christ nor merely a historical Christ, but the present Christ, the practical Christ, the very living Christ who is the embodiment of God dispensing Himself into our entire being by abiding in us with the Father through the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">TO MINGLE THE BELIEVERS WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s dispensation in the ministry of Christ is also to mingle the believers with the Triune God (John 17:21-23). For example, when you put a tea bag into a glass of water, sometimes you help it by mixing it up. You stir the water to mix the tea with the water. That is mingling. Sometimes we want to go home and sleep well, but instead the Lord sends something to stir up the situation. We have to realize that our troubles and problems are for the mingling. We can all testify that suffering helps us to be mingled with the Triune God. The Lord Jesus is not satisfied just to abide in us. He wants to mingle us with Himself. When you put a tea bag into the water, your intention is that the tea will saturate the water, causing the very essence and taste and flavor of the tea to be mingled with the water. This will make the water tea. Christ within you is doing something all the time to mingle Himself with you to make you Christ. This mingling I would call &ldquo;Christifying.&rdquo; You are like a glass of plain water, and the tea is &ldquo;teaifying&rdquo; you to make you tea. That is the tea being dispensed into the water. That is a good example of God dispensing Himself into us to make us Christified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO BE THE OVERFLOW OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
FROM WITHIN THE BELIEVERS<br />
AS THE RIVERS OF LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>This is wonderful, but this is not all. Eventually this dispensing Christ who has mingled Himself with us will overflow from within us like rivers of living water for all eternity (John 7:38-39; Rev. 22:1-2). I am so happy because whenever I speak I have the deep sensation that something is overflowing endlessly. At the end of the Bible you can see a city with a river flowing all the time. There the river of life is flowing and even overflowing with the water of life. In this flowing water grows the tree of life, full of life supply. That will be our eternal living. That is our eternal destiny. Today we could have a foretaste. The very dispensing God eventually overflows from within us to water others and to quench others&rsquo; thirst and to supply others with the tree of life. This becomes their very life supply. This is God&rsquo;s dispensing in Christ&rsquo;s ministry.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING<br />
IN THE MINISTRY OF PAUL</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 2:2; Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:8, 10; 2 Cor. 4:5; Rom. 10:12; Eph. 4:5; Rom. 8:3, 32; 1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15; Titus 2:13; Heb. 4:14; 7:26</h1>
<p>In this message we come to God&rsquo;s dispensation in the ministry of Paul. Paul has presented us many items of what Christ is. Thirty-four items are covered in this message, all of which are concerning Christ in God&rsquo;s dispensation. In Paul&rsquo;s ministry Christ is ministered solely (1 Cor. 2:2):</p>
<h2 class="head1">1. AS GOD THE CREATOR</h2>
<p>First of all Paul ministered Christ as God the Creator (Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:8, 10). God the Creator is not just for creation. His creation has a goal, that of dispensing Himself into His created man. Let us read Romans 9:5: &ldquo;Whose are the fathers, and out of whom according to flesh is the Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.&rdquo; This verse tells us that Christ came out of the fathers according to the flesh. In the flesh He came out of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David, and eventually Mary. So He was a man in the flesh. Yet the last part says, &ldquo;Who is over all, God blessed forever.&rdquo; This One who was in the flesh was not only a man but also God who is over all and blessed forever. The same expression is used in Romans 1:25 where it says that the Creator is blessed forever.</p>
<p>Our Christ is the very God, the very Creator, who is blessed forever, yet for the purpose of dispensing God into us He became a man.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:8 tells us that He is the Son of God, yet He is God Himself. He was not only God but also the Creator (Heb. 1:10). He created all the things for the purpose of dispensing Himself into man. The heavens were created for the earth, the earth was created for man, and man was created for God&rsquo;s dispensing. Man is at the center of the universe to be a vessel to contain God. God&rsquo;s intention is just to infuse or dispense Himself into man, His human vessel. If we human beings do not have God within us, we are empty and the universe is empty. Everything is vain if it does not have God in it. But God has dispensed Himself into us so that we are filled with God. We do have the reality, and we make the universe real. If we did not have God as the reality within us, the entire universe would be empty. But today the universe is not empty because we, the center of the universe, are full of reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">2. AS THE LORD OF ALL</h2>
<p>Paul ministered Christ as the Lord of all (2 Cor. 4:5; Rom. 10:12; Eph. 4:5). The Lord of all does not mean the Lord of all things, but the Lord of all men. This is a quotation from Romans 10:12 which says that &ldquo;the same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; How can He, as the Lord of all, be rich to you? He has to be dispensed into you. If the Lord Jesus has not been dispensed into you, and you do not have Him within you, He cannot be rich to you for your enjoyment. The Lord who is within you is the Lord of all, who is rich to you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">3. AS THE SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>Romans 8:3 reads, &ldquo;For, the law being impossible in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; When the law could not work out God&rsquo;s purpose, He sent His Son to fulfill His purpose. Never forget that the purpose of God is to dispense Himself into us. The law cannot give us life (Gal. 3:21) for the dispensing of God into us. The law can only require us to do good. The law could not dispense anything into our being, so God sent His Son to dispense God into us. The main purpose of Christ&rsquo;s coming is to dispense Himself into us.</p>
<p>Romans 8:32 says &ldquo;He Who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?&rdquo; This verse tells us that God did not spare His Son, but that He delivered Him up so that through Him God could dispense Himself into our being. Since God did not spare His own Son, neither would He spare anything else from us. He gives us His Son that He may give us everything that He has. The first thing that He has to give us is life (1 John 5:12-13), and the second thing is His nature (2 Pet. 1:4). The third thing is the divine glory (1 Pet. 5:10). So God has given us His Son in order that He can dispense His life, His nature, and His glory into us.</p><h2 class="head1">4. AS THE SPIRIT THAT GIVES LIFE</h2>
<p>Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17). We could also substitute the word dispensing for the word giving. He became the life-dispensing Spirit. Our Christ is the Spirit that dispenses life into us. If Christ had not become the Spirit, He could not get into us. Spirit in Greek is <em>pneuma,</em> which also means air or wind. Christ is the Spirit, the air, and the wind for getting into us. Nothing could get into us so easily and thoroughly and continuously as the air. While I am speaking and you are listening, we are unconsciously getting air into us. This is a picture of Christ. We have our life in Him just like we have our life in the air. If we were in a room without air, we would die. To die is to stop breathing. When I stop breathing, I die. We have to breathe Christ into us. A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance wrote a number of good hymns which are very deep. One of these hymns is concerning breathing Christ into us (#255 in <em>Hymns</em>).</p>
<p>Why do we call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name? This is our breathing. Even this is our deep breathing. Physically speaking deep breathing is very healthy. To cry, O Lord Jesus! is deep breathing. If you practice this, you will see how healthy you will be. Sometimes it may seem that you cannot bear the murmuring and the long face of your wife. Then you need to call upon the Name. Don&rsquo;t forget that you are Enosh, a fragile man, who calls upon the name of the eternal One (Gen. 4:26). If you call upon the name of the Lord Jesus you will be energized. For example, you should not drive a car with a flat tire. That means it is short of air. Too many Christians today are short of the spiritual air. They have a &ldquo;flat tire.&rdquo; Some do not come to the meetings because they have a &ldquo;flat tire.&rdquo; They may say that they have problems with their wife or problems with a certain brother or problems with the elders. This is a flat tire. Don&rsquo;t blame your wife or that certain brother or the elders. Blame your flat tire. You have to go to the &ldquo;gas station&rdquo; and get some air for your flat tire. Where is the gas station? It is the church! Come to the church, and you would get the air. You will be filled up with the living air. Call on His name to be filled with air. This is the Spirit that dispenses life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">5. AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). Whatever God the Father is, whatever God the Son is, and whatever God the Spirit is, is all embodied in this one Person. Within Him are all the divine riches for dispensing God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">6. AS THE EFFULGENCE OF GOD&rsquo;S GLORY<br />
AND THE IMAGE OF THE SUBSTANCE</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the effulgence, the expression, of God&rsquo;s glory, and He is the very image, the expression of God&rsquo;s substance (Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:15). He is the very expression of what God is. Again this is for the purpose of dispensing and infusing God into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">7. AS THE APOSTLE</h2>
<p>Christ is the Apostle sent by God to minister God Himself to us (Heb. 3:1). A sent one, an apostle, is the one who brings something to others. Christ was the first Apostle in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy sent by God and from God to bring God to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">8. AS THE CAPTAIN OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>He is not only the Apostle, but also the Captain of salvation (Heb. 2:10). God&rsquo;s salvation is a fighting, a battle. For fighting there is the need of an army, and for the army there is the need of the captain. Christ is the Captain of God&rsquo;s salvation for dispensing the life of God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">9. AS THE SAVIOR</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Savior (Titus 2:13). By reading Titus 2:13 carefully you can see that our Savior is just the great God. Jesus Christ is both the Savior and the great God to us. He is the great God becoming our Savior for the purpose of dispensing God into us, His saved ones.</p><h2 class="head1">10. AS THE FORERUNNER</h2>
<p>Hebrews 6:20 tells us that Christ is the Forerunner. We are all runners, running from all the things outside of God. We run into God. The first One who was running into God was the man Jesus Christ, the Nazarene. He was the forerunner, running from anything other than God into God. He is now within the veil in the Holy of Holies where God is. He was the first to get there. He was the forerunner, and we also are running the same race. We are running into God. Christ took the lead to run this race, and He is bringing us into God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">11. AS THE HIGH PRIEST</h2>
<p>As our High Priest He prays for us and takes care of our case (Heb. 4:14; 7:26). He sustains us and supplies us with all our need for the purpose of dispensing God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">12. AS OFFERINGS FOR SIN AND SINS</h2>
<p>Christ is also the offerings for sin and sins (Heb. 9:26, 28; 10:12). First of all He is the sin-offering. He is the offering for sin in the singular number, referring to our sinful nature. Then He is also the offering for sins, in the plural number. These are our trespasses and offenses and wrongdoings. Christ is the offering both for sin and sins. Sin is the biggest obstacle which frustrates God from dispensing Himself into us. Christ has solved this problem, taking away our sin, to remove the obstacle so that God can have a free way to dispense Himself into us. He &ldquo;offered one sacrifice for sins,&rdquo; dealing with all our trespasses and wrongdoings. Hallelujah! Today the way is fully cleared up for us to contact God and for God to dispense Himself into us. There is a free way and a free course for God to dispense Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">13. AS THE PASSOVER</h2>
<p>Christ is also our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7). Because we have Christ, nothing can condemn us (Rom. 8:1). Even God cannot condemn us (Rom. 8:33). We have such a Passover. On the day of the Passover the blood of the lamb was shed for all the children of Israel, and God&rsquo;s condemnation passed over them. That was the Passover so that the children of Israel might eat the meat of the lamb to receive life. So the Passover is for the dispensing of life into the redeemed ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">14. AS THE MEDIATOR</h2>
<p>First Timothy 2:5 says that Christ is our Mediator. A mediator is a middle man. When there are problems between two parties, there is the need of a mediator. There were problems between us and God, but Christ is our Mediator to make everything right so that God can dispense Himself into us. For example, in my home we use electricity for light, for heating, for cooling, for power. Sometimes there is the problem with the air conditioner or with the heater or with the lights. So we always need a mediator. We call a dear brother who lives in Anaheim to come and look at the problem. With God there is no problem, but with us there are many problems. Just a little unhappiness with your wife becomes a problem and the heavenly &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work so well. Then you have to call upon the Mediator. When you call upon Him, He is very present. He clears up your problem and right away God flows once again. Just a little wrong attitude hinders God flowing within you. Again you have to call upon the Mediator: O Lord Jesus! Then the flow is restored. This is Christ as our Mediator for the dispensing of God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">15. AS THE SURETY OF THE BETTER COVENANT</h2>
<p>Christ is the surety of the better covenant (Heb. 7:22). With an agreement or contract, there is the need of a guarantee or a guarantor. Jesus Christ is both the guarantee and the guarantor for dispensing God into us. In order for God to dispense Himself into us He made a covenant with us. To assure us of His dispensing Himself into us, God signed the contract. Christ is the guarantee and the guarantor, the surety, of this contract.</p><h2 class="head1">16. AS THE MEDIATOR OF THE NEW COVENANT</h2>
<p>Christ is the Mediator between God and us, and He is also the Mediator of the new covenant, the new contract (Heb. 8:6; 9:15; 12:24). This means that Christ is like an attorney who is always pleading our case before God. The Lord Jesus always wins our case before God. We have a good attorney. He wins the case for us, and He also protects God so that God can continue to flow into us. Our attorney has fully taken care of the case according to the contract which was sealed by His blood (Heb. 10:29).</p>
<h2 class="head1">17. AS THE AUTHOR AND PERFECTER OF FAITH</h2>
<p>Faith is the way to enjoy God, but we do not have faith in ourselves. Our faith can only last a short time. But Christ is the Author, the Originator, and the Perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12:2). This means that He is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the ending, of our faith. In other words He is our faith, and this faith lasts forever. If you feel that your faith is weak, you had better call on the Lord&rsquo;s name: Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus! After calling a few times you will have faith within you. Faith is nothing less than Christ Himself. He is the Author and Perfecter of our faith. When we have Him we have faith, and this faith is for God to dispense Himself into us for our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">18. AS THE GREAT SHEPHERD</h2>
<p>Christ is the great Shepherd of the sheep (Heb. 13:20). What is the difference between a shepherd and a priest or between a shepherd and a forerunner? None of the other titles is so tender as shepherd. The shepherd is very tender toward the sheep. We are God&rsquo;s flock, and this flock needs the shepherd. A shepherd takes care of all the needs of the flock. His main goal is to feed the flock. He does everything for the flock so that the flock may eat properly. This is the dispensing of life. The feeding on the grass is to receive the life supply, so the shepherd&rsquo;s business is to dispense life into the sheep. Our great Shepherd, Christ, feeds us with God as the green pasture. This is to dispense God&rsquo;s divine life into our being. Many Christians are familiar with Psalm 23 which says that the Lord is our Shepherd, but they may not realize that Christ is our Shepherd to dispense God into us as our nourishment so that we may have more of the divine life. This point has been neglected among the Christians. Our burden is to tell all the Christians today that the Lord Jesus shepherds us to feed us with God as our nourishment so that we may have more and more of the divine life dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">19. AS THE DIVINE RICHES</h2>
<p>The next item is the divine riches, the unsearchable riches, of Christ (Eph. 3:8). Paul said that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ. Paul was not preaching mere doctrine. He preached the unsearchable riches of Christ so that all the believers might receive more of God, more of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">20. AS THE DIVINE LIFE</h2>
<p>By enjoying the divine riches, you have the divine life (Col. 3:4). The divine life is the first item of the divine riches which God dispenses into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">21. AS POWER AND WISDOM:<br />
RIGHTEOUSNESS,<br />
SANCTIFICATION, AND REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>Whenever the divine life is dispensed into us, we have the power and wisdom, the righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). Christ is God&rsquo;s power and wisdom. When He is dispensed into us He becomes our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head1">22. AS THE FOUNDATION</h2>
<p>Christ is also the foundation (1 Cor. 3:11). We are not a floating people. We are a people founded on the solid foundation. I am not afraid of all the attacks of the opposing ones because I am solidly founded. I have a solid foundation, my Lord Jesus Christ. The more they attack, the more I enjoy the dispensing of God because I am on a solid foundation. Our standing is not sinking sand; our foundation is the solid rock. The Lord Jesus Christ is our foundation so that God may dispense Himself into us all the time in a solid way.</p><h2 class="head1">23. AS THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; FOOD, DRINK,<br />
AND CLOTHING</h2>
<p>Our Lord Jesus is our food, our drink, and our clothing (1 Cor. 10:3-4; Gal. 3:27). We eat of Him, we drink of Him, and we put Him on as our clothing. In the wilderness the Israelites ate the spiritual food, the manna, and drank of a spiritual rock which followed them. Paul told us that the rock was Christ. Paul also told us that &ldquo;as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; This means we put Him on as our spiritual clothing. Hallelujah! He surely is the reality of all our daily necessities.</p>
<h2 class="head1">24. AS THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; TREASURE WITHIN</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is also our treasure within us (2 Cor. 4:7). As we enjoy Him by eating of Him and drinking of Him and putting Him on as our clothing He becomes our treasure. Such a treasure within us is God dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">25. AS THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; SAVOR WITHOUT</h2>
<p>He is also our savor, a fragrant smell outside of us (2 Cor. 2:14). Christ has infused us with God, and this infused God becomes a sweet fragrance for others to enjoy. This is the issue of God&rsquo;s dispensing Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">26. AS THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>He is also our dwelling place. Christ is our home. We are living and dwelling in Him. Paul aspired to be found in Christ (Phil. 3:9a). When we stay in a house a long time, that house becomes our dwelling place. Christ is our dwelling place so that God can dispense Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">27. AS THE HOPE OF GLORY</h2>
<p>According to Colossians 1:27 Christ is our hope of glory. We have a hope waiting for us. We are going into glory. Glory is our goal! We can arrive at our goal by being infused with God all the day. God infuses us and dispenses Himself into us, and this dispensing brings us into glory. This is our hope.</p>
<h2 class="head1">28. AS THE FIRSTBORN SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>Christ is the Firstborn Son of God (Col. 1:18; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 1:5-6). According to Colossians 1:18 the Lord Jesus is the Firstborn from among the dead. This means He is the Firstborn in resurrection, in the new creation. Romans 8:29 says that &ldquo;whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; Through His resurrection He has brought forth many sons of God, many brothers of the Firstborn. Hebrews 1:6 says, &ldquo;And, when He brings again the Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, And let all the angels of God worship Him.&rdquo; In His first coming He was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son (John 1:18; 3:16). Through the process of the death and resurrection the only begotten Son became the Firstborn among many brothers (Rom. 8:29). So at His second coming He will not be the only begotten but the Firstborn among many brothers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">29. AS THE HEAD OF ALL THINGS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:22 says that &ldquo;He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s great power that operated in Christ gave Him to be Head over all things to the church. The headship of Christ over all things is a gift from God to Him. It was through God&rsquo;s surpassingly great power that Christ received the headship over the whole universe. He is Head of all things so that God might be dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">30. AS THE HEAD OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>Christ is the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:22-23). Christ is not only the Head of all things in a general way, but also the Head of the Body, the church. Whatever Christ, the Head, attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body. In this transmission the church shares with Christ all His attainments: the resurrection from among the dead, being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things.</p><h2 class="head1">31. AS THE HUSBAND</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 11:2 reads, &ldquo;For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.&rdquo; He is our husband so that He might dispense all the riches of God which are embodied in Him (Col. 2:9) into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">32. AS THE FIRSTFRUIT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:20 says, &ldquo;But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; Verse 23 says, &ldquo;But each one in his own order: the firstfruit, Christ; after that those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming.&rdquo; Christ was the first one raised from among the dead as the firstfruit of resurrection. Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, shall also be resurrected. This is also to enjoy the dispensing of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">33. AS THE LAST ADAM</h2>
<p>Christ was the last Adam. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; As the last Adam, Christ on the one hand terminated the old man, and on the other hand, He became the life-giving Spirit so that God could be dispensed into us to be our life that we may be God&rsquo;s new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">34. AS THE SECOND MAN</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 15:47 says, &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second Man is out of heaven.&rdquo; Christ is not only the last Adam but also the second Man. The first Adam is the beginning of the old man in the old creation; the last Adam is the ending, the termination of the old man in the old creation.</p>
<p>As the first man, Adam is the head of the old creation, representing it in creation. As the second Man, Christ is Head of the new creation, representing it in resurrection. In the entire universe there are these two men: the first man Adam, including all his descendants, and the second Man Christ, comprised of all His believers. We believers were included in the first man by birth, and we became a part of the second Man by regeneration. Our belief has transferred us out of the first man into the second. As a part of the first man, our origin is the earth, and our nature is earthy. As a part of the second Man, our origin is God, and our nature is heavenly. This is also for the dispensing of the divine life.</p>
<p>All these points indicate that Christ is everything to us so that God can dispense Himself into us. What a wonderful Christ! He is so rich for the dispensing of God into our being.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING<br />
IN THE MINISTRY OF PAUL</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 2:10-12; Rom. 8:29; 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12, 13, 27; Col. 1:18; Eph. 4:4; 1:23; 1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; Eph. 2:21-22; 2:15; 4:22-24; Col. 3:10-11; Eph. 3:19; 1:10</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we worship You as the speaking and dispensing God! We thank You that You have been speaking so much to us to dispense Yourself into us. Thank You that in these days we are under Your dispensing. Even in this message we are listening to Your word. We would like to receive Your dispensing. O Lord Jesus! make these days full of dispensing. Dispense Yourself into us during these days that all of us will be filled up with Your dispensing. Thank You, Lord, for Your cleansing blood which opens up the way for You to come in to dispense and saturate us with Yourself. Thank You for Your speaking in this meeting. We trust in You. We have no trust in ourselves. Amen.</p>
<p>In the foregoing message we saw that whatever Christ is, is for the one purpose of dispensing God into us. This is the focus of the entire Bible. But it has not been seen by many Christians today. Christianity has made nearly everything religious, instead of making everything divine. We all have to rise up against anything religious. We should be altogether for something divine. To be regenerated is not something religious; it is something divine. Regeneration is not to have a religious life. It is to have a divine life in addition to our human life. Such a divine life with a divine birth makes us a divine child of God. This is the initial stage of God&rsquo;s dispensing Himself into us. God first dispenses Himself into us by regeneration. It is our second birth, our spiritual and even divine birth. Birth is just a beginning of life. Without birth there is no life. Hallelujah! we have had the beginning of the divine life. This beginning is just the divine birth, regeneration.</p>
<p>Many Christians seem to have forgotten about their regeneration. Although they are born again and had such a wonderful divine beginning, after their regeneration they were led astray from the divine things to the religious practices. After their regeneration, they made nearly everything religious. For example, they talk about love and holiness apart from the divine life. They talk about being a good husband or a good wife apart from the divine life. They talk about being good children or good parents apart from the divine life. Even they talk about being a good Christian apart from the divine life.</p>
<p>In the Epistles of the New Testament, especially those of Paul, the phrase, &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;in the Lord&rdquo; occurs frequently. This is a short and brief, but a very crucial phrase. For example, in Ephesians 6:1 Paul said, &ldquo;The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&rdquo; Many Christians, however, in their understanding cut off this phrase, &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo; This crucial phrase means a lot! If we are not in the Lord, there is no Christian life. Honoring the parents, loving the wife, or submitting to the husband must be in the Lord. If these things are not in the Lord, that is not the Christian life, but an ethical life. Ethics teaches good morality, behavior, and character but altogether outside of Christ and apart from Christ. But we Christians are in Christ. We are not apart from Christ; we are part of Christ. We are in an organic union with Christ. He is the vine, and we are the branches (John 15:5). The branches of the vine are not simply joined to the vine; they are organically united to the vine. The branches and the vine have a common life. The branches could not have their being without the vine.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH PRODUCED</h2>
<p>Now we come to the issue of God&rsquo;s dispensing. In order for God to dispense Himself into us, Christ is many items. In the foregoing message we covered thirty-four of those items. Of those thirty-four items, one item is very significant, that is, Christ is the firstborn Son of God. I was a Christian for a number of years before I understood and paid attention to the fact that first Christ was the only begotten Son of God, and that He became the firstborn Son of God. The only begotten means the only Son, the only one, and the firstborn means the first one among many. Does God have one Son or many sons? This is a crucial point. If we could not see this point, we could not understand what is the issue of God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that Jesus Christ, after living on this earth thirty-three and one-half years, was born? In Acts 13:33 Peter indicated to us that when the Lord Jesus was raised up in resurrection, He was begotten of God. Was He not the Son of God before resurrection? Surely He was! Since He was the Son of God before His resurrection, why did He still need to be born in resurrection to be the Son of God? This is not easy to explain. Before His incarnation He was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son in eternity. He did not have any human nature with the blood and flesh. He was altogether divine. One day He became flesh. This means He took the human nature upon Him. He took blood and flesh upon Himself (Heb. 2:14) and became human. Within Him there was something divine. That was the Son of God. But His human nature was the Son of Man. It was human and not divine. The inward being of Jesus was the Son of God already, but the outward being, His humanity was the Son of Man. His outward being, His humanity, was not yet the Son of God. It was His outward being that needed to be born of God.</p>
<p>How could Christ&rsquo;s humanity be born to be the Son of God? It was through death and resurrection. Christ&rsquo;s death brought His humanity into resurrection. Through resurrection His humanity was born into the divine sonship. So the resurrection of Christ was the birth of His humanity into the sonship of God. This made Him, the only begotten Son of God, the firstborn Son of God.</p>
<p>Sometimes in human birth there are twins, that is, one delivery with two children or triplets, that is, one delivery with three children. In the resurrection of Christ, in that delivery, there were not only two or three children, but millions of children. There was one delivery, but many sons of God, many brothers of Christ were brought forth (Heb. 2:10-12; Rom. 8:29). Christ as the firstborn Son of God does not have any sisters. He only has brothers, sons of God. All the sisters are also brothers of Christ. In that one delivery many, many sons were born. Of the many who were born, the first was the man Jesus. Then all of us were born. I don&rsquo;t know what number you are or what number I am, but when Christ was born, we were born too. When Christ was resurrected, we were resurrected. He was the only begotten Son of God before His resurrection, but through His resurrection the only begotten Son became the firstborn Son. The Firstborn is the leading one. He takes the lead, and we all follow. What He has gone through, we also should pass through. He went through death, and we also should go through the same process of death and resurrection.</p>
<p>Today we are in the process of death and resurrection so that we might be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God (Rom. 8:29). The many brothers are just the issue of God&rsquo;s dispensing. At the resurrection of Christ, God infused and dispensed Himself into millions of Christ&rsquo;s believers. This means at one juncture, even in one action, God the Father dispensed Himself into all of us. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was the dispensing of God into millions of Christians.</p>
<p>Every human birth is a dispensing of the father&rsquo;s life into the child. Before a man becomes a father he is only one, but after the birth of his child, his life has been dispensed into another one. What is resurrection? It is the dispensing of God into His believers. What is regeneration? That also is the dispensing of God into the believers. This basic thought must be impressed into our being. Then we will be revolutionized in our thinking, and we will never try to improve our character. We need to forget about improving our character. That is not the biblical revelation, but mere human ethics.</p>
<p>We did have such a good beginning. God was dispensed into our being. So we all became sons of God. We became, not creatures of God, but sons of God. And we are sons, not by adoption, but by birth. We are the typical, genuine, and real sons of God. In our new birth our Father has dispensed Himself into our being. Actually our being comes out of this dispensing. Without such a divine dispensing, we don&rsquo;t have our being. Our being comes out of our Father&rsquo;s life. The issue of such a divine dispensing is the church. The church is not you and me and so many others added together. The entire church is the issue of the dispensing of our Father.</p>
<p>For example, consider Eve in Genesis 2. How did she come into existence? Adam was created by God out of the dust of the ground, but Eve was not created in that way. Eve came forth as the issue of life dispensing. Life in the form of a rib was dispensed out of Adam and issued in Eve. In other words, Eve was the increase of Adam. The church is not just an organization of human beings. The church is the increase of Christ. The increase of a person is surely the dispensing of his life. We have already mentioned that birth is a dispensing of life. The church is altogether a matter of the dispensing of life. The church is the total dispensing of God into His chosen people. God dispenses Himself into this one, into that one, and into so many others. We are the total dispensing of our Father. The church is just the family of God. A family is the total dispensing of the father. Likewise, the church is just the totality of the dispensing of God our Father into so many sons. The many sons of God which came forth in the resurrection of Christ are also the many brothers of Christ (Heb. 2:10-12; Rom. 8:29). The many brothers are the many members of Christ (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12), and these many members are just the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13, 27; Col. 1:18; Eph. 4:4). The Body of Christ is the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23), and this fullness is the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5). The house of God also is the temple of God (1 Cor. 3:16-17; Eph. 2:21-22). All these aspects of the church come from God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>The more I speak something about God&rsquo;s dispensing and about Christ increased in us, the more my burden is stirred up. I can never exhaust this kind of speaking. If you give me the time I would tell you again and again concerning God&rsquo;s dispensing from the first page of the Bible to the last. I would tell you again and again that God wants to be planted in you as the tree of life to grow into every part of your being and to infuse you with God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>In that one resurrection of Christ, that one delivery, millions of children were born. They are just the totality of God&rsquo;s dispensing. And this totality becomes the church which is His Body (Eph. 1:22-23). This is also His fullness. Without the church, Christ has no fullness. This fullness of Christ is the house of God where God dwells. The fullness contains God, it is the temple of God. The temple is not only God&rsquo;s house, but also our house. Not only does the Father live in this house, but all the children live in this house, too. Here in Stuttgart God has a temple as His own house which has become our house. We who are the children, the issue of His dispensing, and the Father, the source of this dispensing, dwell together in this house. This is the church life. Such a church life is the total issue of God&rsquo;s continuous dispensing.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST MINISTERED AND THE CHURCH PRODUCED</h2>
<p>When Christ is ministered and the church is produced, they two become the corporate Christ. The ministered Christ with the church produced out of Him becomes the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12). The church itself is the fullness of Christ, the expression of Christ (Eph. 1:23); whereas the corporate Christ, that is, the individual Christ with the church as His Body, is the fullness of God, the expression of God (Eph. 3:19). First the church is the fullness of Christ, then Christ and the church become the fullness of God. God is manifested in such a corporate Christ who is the new man (Eph. 2:15; 4:22-24; Col. 3:10-11). This new man has Christ as his Head and the church as his Body, as a universal man for God&rsquo;s expression and satisfaction. This will consummate in the New Jerusalem. God has been dispensing Himself throughout all the generations, and the ultimate issue will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. The New Jerusalem will be just the fullness of the Triune God. Even as the church today is the fullness of Christ, so in the same principle, the New Jerusalem will be the fullness of the Triune God. Looking at the New Jerusalem, you can see that God is expressed in His fullness to the uttermost. It is the Triune God expressed in full in His dispensation. That will be the fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10. At the fullness of times God will head up all things in Christ. Today God only heads up the church in Christ on a smaller scale. But when the new heaven and the new earth come, God will head up the entire universe in Christ. That will be the total expression of God through His dispensing of Himself into His chosen people throughout all the generations.</p>
<p>You all need to see this. You need a vision that will change your concepts and your view and revolutionize your entire being. Then you will hate the ethical things such as improving your behavior and character. Then you will aspire for the divine things. You will aspire for the divine dispensing of the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine glory to be increased in your being. This is the Christian life, and this is the church life. This is the life that God is after. God wants a group of people redeemed and regenerated and living by the dispensing God. We need to live by the divine dispensing. Day after day we all must be under this dispensing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING<br />
IN THE MINISTRY OF<br />
PETER, JUDE, AND JAMES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 3:13; 2 Pet. 1:17; Acts 3:15; 2:36; 10:36; 2 Pet. 1:1; 3:18; 1 Pet. 1:19; 2:4, 7, 25; 5:4; 2:9; 1:18, 2, 3, 23; 2:2-3, 5; 4:17; 5:2; 3:7; 4:10; 2 Pet. 1:3-4; 1 Pet. 5:10; Jude 20, 21, 24; James 1:17, 18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE MINISTRY OF PETER</h2>
<p>In the past two messages we saw God&rsquo;s dispensation in the ministry of Paul. In this message we want to see His dispensation in the ministry of Peter, Jude, and James. Compared to Paul&rsquo;s writings, Peter&rsquo;s are very brief. Yet the crucial points in his writings are very similar to the crucial points in Paul&rsquo;s writings. Paul, though, had at least two particular points which Peter did not mention. Paul specifically told us that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:23). He also told us that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), and that the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Peter never told us this, though he mentioned the Spirit of Christ (1 Pet. 1:11), and the Spirit of glory and of God (1 Pet. 4:14). This indicates that according to Peter&rsquo;s understanding the Spirit of God in the New Testament age has become the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of glory.</p>
<p>Peter also has one precious point which Paul did not mention, that is, we are the partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). This item in the Bible is a big diamond. It means that we are enjoying the divine essence of what God is. We are partaking of the divine elements of God&rsquo;s being. Such an expression, partakers of the divine nature, is very strong! I am so happy that Peter wrote this. Otherwise, in the entire Bible there would not be a word telling us that we are now enjoying the very essence of God. What a great lack there would be if this were not in the Bible! I surely would like to have a sign to hang in my room saying: &ldquo;Partakers of the divine nature.&rdquo; Surely the biggest blessing in the whole universe is that we can partake of God&rsquo;s nature and essence. This is far beyond our understanding and even the more is far beyond our ability to speak. We are short of the utterance to describe such a thing.</p>
<p>What does it mean to partake of the divine nature? Let me illustrate it in this way. Suppose you have a little creature, a chicken. A chicken lays eggs, but it never studied in an egg-laying school. To lay eggs is simply something of the chicken nature. By this illustration you may have a little apprehension of what it means for us to be partakers of the divine nature.</p>
<p>As soon as we were regenerated there was a kind of nature within us that would not agree for us to do certain things. No one had to teach us not to do certain things. Something within our nature was telling us that as children of God we should not do that thing. Even as the chicken&rsquo;s nature is in the chicken, so the divine nature is in those who have been born of God. We have been born of God with God&rsquo;s divine life. Life and nature cannot be separated. Actually the nature is the essence of the life. God&rsquo;s nature is within God&rsquo;s life, so the very divine life with which we have been born again has within it the divine nature. Right after our regeneration we began to partake of this nature, even unconsciously.</p>
<p>Let me give you another illustration concerning the divine nature. A little baby does not have any knowledge about bitterness or sweetness. He has not been taught what is bitter or what is sweet. Even he does not have such a vocabulary. But if you put something sweet into his mouth he will swallow it, and if you put something bitter into his mouth he will spit it out. Who taught him to do this? It comes out of his nature. His nature rejects the bitterness. Whatever is bitter is rejected by his human nature. Whatever is sweet is accepted by his human nature. Right after he has been delivered, even when he is very young, a baby rejects and accepts certain things.</p>
<p>Likewise, at our regeneration, another nature got into us. This is the nature of God, the divine nature. We began to enjoy this divine nature right after our regeneration. As believers we all are partakers of such a divine nature within us. Peter did not say we <em>have</em> a divine nature, but that we have become partakers of the divine nature. It is now within us, and we are partaking of it. That means that we are now enjoying it. And we enjoy it unconsciously and unintentionally. A little baby rejects the bitterness and receives the sweetness without intention. If you put something bitter into his mouth he rejects it unintentionally. This is the action of his nature.</p>
<p>It is hard for us to describe and to know the nature, but we can surely discern the actions of the nature. It is hard to say what is the chicken nature, but we can discern the actions of the chicken nature. The main action of the chicken&rsquo;s nature is to lay eggs.</p>
<p>We are children of God. We have been born of the divine life, and within the divine life there is the divine nature. Now we are partaking of this nature and enjoying this nature unintentionally. There are too many things that this divine nature within us rejects. Although no one teaches us to reject this thing or to reject that thing, as Christians we just reject it because we have partaken of the divine nature within us.</p><h2 class="head2">As God</h2>
<p>Now let us consider the aspects of Christ ministered by Peter for the dispensing of God into us. First of all Peter also ministered Christ as God. Second Peter 1:1 has the phrase, &ldquo;In the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This indicates that Jesus Christ our Savior is God. He is our God-Savior. He is our God to become our Savior. The main purpose of God being our Savior is so that He may dispense Himself into us as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Son of God</h2>
<p>Peter also ministered Christ as the Son of God (Acts 3:13; 2 Pet. 1:17). Acts 3:13 refers to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, and 2 Peter 1:17 refers to His transfiguration. Both are for Christ&rsquo;s glorification. Christ was glorified in His transfiguration on the mount, and Christ was glorified in His resurrection. On both occasions it was made clear that He was the Son of God. Such a Son of God is for the dispensing of God&rsquo;s life. The New Testament tells us that if you have the Son of God, you have life. If you do not have the Son of God, you do not have life (1 John 5:11, 12). God gives His Son to us that we may have life. John 3:16 reads, &ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&rdquo; The reason the Son of God has been given to us is to dispense the eternal life of God into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Author of Life</h2>
<p>Peter said that the Jewish leaders had killed the Author of life, but that God had raised Him up (Acts 3:15, lit.). Eventually their killing of the Author of life helped God&rsquo;s dispensing. If the Author of life had not died, He could not have been released in resurrection for the dispensing of God into His chosen people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Lord of All</h2>
<p>In Acts 2:36 Peter said that God had made Jesus both Lord and Christ. Then in Acts 10:36 while Peter was speaking in the house of Cornelius, he said, &ldquo;The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:).&rdquo; While Peter was speaking in the house of Cornelius, the Gentile ruler, he saw that the Lord Jesus is not only the Lord of the Jews, but also the Lord of the Gentiles. So Peter said He is Lord of all. In this verse the stress is not that He is the Lord of all things, but that He is the Lord of all people. He is the Lord of all people so that He might give eternal life to them. John 17:2 says, &ldquo;Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.&rdquo; To have the authority over all flesh means to be the Lord of all the people so that He might give eternal life to them. If Christ is not the Lord of all of us, He has no position to give us eternal life. But He is the Lord of all of us, so we are under Him. He has the position to dispense the eternal life to whomever God has chosen. The term &ldquo;the Lord of all&rdquo; indicates the dispensing of God&rsquo;s life into God&rsquo;s chosen people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As Christ</h2>
<p>Because the title Christ is so familiar to us, we may miss its real significance. In Greek Christ is <em>Christos</em> which means the anointed One who anoints. He is the anointed One of God who anoints us. The anointing is for life giving, for God&rsquo;s dispensing. Actually Christ is the agent of God&rsquo;s dispensing, who carries out God&rsquo;s dispensing by being the anointed One to anoint every one whom God has chosen. He anoints us with the Spirit of life so that we may have the divine life dispensed into us. By getting into the meaning of this title, you can see that Christ is for God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As Savior</h2>
<p>The Savior is also for the dispensing of the divine life (2 Pet. 1:1; 3:18). Jesus is our Savior, not just to save us from our sins, but also to dispense the eternal life into our being for our subjective salvation. He is our Savior for us to have life. So the Savior is for God&rsquo;s dispensing to bring God into us.</p><h2 class="head2">As a Lamb Without Blemish and Spot</h2>
<p>According to Peter, Christ is a lamb without blemish and spot (1 Pet. 1:19). This also is for life dispensing. We are sinful, and unless there is such a lamb without blemish and spot, our sins could never be taken away. Furthermore, Christ&rsquo;s redemption according to 1 Peter 1:18 is not just to redeem us from sin or from hell, but to redeem us from our vain manner of life. His blood redeems us from our vain and corrupted life that we may live a godly life. How could we live a godly life if we did not have a godly life? How could we have a godly life except through Christ&rsquo;s redemption? By this view you can see that even Christ being a lamb without blemish and spot is for life dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As a Living Stone</h2>
<p>Peter ministered Christ as a living stone (1 Pet. 2:4, 7). A living stone doesn&rsquo;t mean only a stone of life, but a stone which is living, acting, and working. The very Christ who lives in you is such a stone. You have a piece of living stone within you. John 6 tells us that He is the living bread (v. 51). He is not only the bread of life, but also the living bread, the bread that lives in you. The food we take into our stomach is living and organic. After a few hours it becomes us. If the food were not living it could not get into our blood and into our cells. If we eat a piece of stone, it will remain within us as a dead stone. When the bread is on the table, it is the bread of life. When it gets into us, it becomes the living bread. Could you see the difference? Where is Christ today? Outside of us He is the stone of life, but inside of us He becomes the living stone. Christ as a stone is organic and living. We can become a living stone because this living stone has been dispensed into us and lives in us to make us living. By this we can see that Christ is a living stone to dispense life into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Shepherd and Overseer of our Souls</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls (1 Pet. 2:25; 5:4). As we have mentioned previously the main point in taking care of the sheep is to feed them so that they may have more life. So the shepherding is also for life dispensing. The purpose of the overseer is to watch over the sheep so that they would not be hurt or carried away. The shepherd first takes care of us to feed us and eventually becomes our overseer to keep us always under the life dispensing. Every item of what Christ is, is a life-dispensing matter. Whatever Christ is, is for life dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS PRODUCED</h2>
<p>The result of all the life dispensing by what Christ is, is that the believers are produced. First they are chosen by God (1 Pet. 2:9a). Second, they are redeemed with the precious blood of Christ (1 Pet. 1:18-19). They are chosen and redeemed to receive life. Then they are sanctified, or separated, to receive life (1 Pet. 1:2). Finally, they are regenerated of the incorruptible seed of God to receive life (1 Pet. 1:3, 23). On God&rsquo;s side regeneration is to dispense life, and on our side it is to receive life. We all have been regenerated of the incorruptible seed of God. This is the Word of life, which is really life itself. The divine life is the incorruptible seed of which we all have been born.</p>
<p>As those who have been born of the incorruptible seed we are newborn babes who long for the guileless milk of the word (1 Pet. 2:2, 3). Newborn babes only know how to do one thing, and that is to take milk. They don&rsquo;t know how to improve their behavior, and they don&rsquo;t know how to care for their character. They only care for the milk. They don&rsquo;t even know the word milk, but something in their nature longs for the milk. Right after regeneration we become the newborn babes. We have to long for the guileless milk of the Word. Every day and all the time we need to get into the Word. In the Word there is the milk. When a little baby is not happy, it means he is short of milk. When you are not so happy, it means you have not taken any milk from the Word. When I get into the Word I get into the milk, and my face is so broad and shining. When you have just a little time of morning watch in the Word, you will come out of your room with your face shining. As newborn babes you need the milk for growing.</p>
<p>By growing we become the living stones to be built up a spiritual house, into a holy and royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; 4:17). This is the result of the life dispensing. It makes us living stones for the building up of God&rsquo;s spiritual house. This spiritual house is a body of priests, a holy and royal priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God and to tell out the virtues of God.</p>
<p>Through regeneration of the life of God, we also become the flock of God which is always receiving the life nourishment from the Shepherd (1 Pet. 5:2), and heirs of the grace of life, inheriting all the riches of life (1 Pet. 3:7). Then we become stewards of the varied grace of God (1 Pet. 4:10). We become not only heirs of grace to receive grace, but also stewards of grace to minister grace to others. Because we are so full of grace, we become stewards of grace to serve others with grace. This is wonderful! Even your serving others with grace is a kind of life dispensing. In our Christian life, we all are stewards. You are a steward to me, and I am a steward to you. You minister life to me, and I minister life to you. There is a mutual dispensing among us. Actually our fellowship with one another is a mutual life dispensing. By this kind of life dispensing we are partaking of and enjoying what God is. This is to partake of God&rsquo;s divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). For this purpose God has given us all things relating to life and godliness (2 Pet. 1:3), and also given us precious and exceedingly great promises (2 Pet. 1:4). To partake of God&rsquo;s divine nature is to enjoy God&rsquo;s life dispensing.</p>
<p>Eventually we will be perfected, established, strengthened, and grounded by God&rsquo;s life dispensing, that we may be brought into God&rsquo;s eternal glory (1 Pet. 5:10). Without God dispensing Himself into us as life, we could never be perfected, strengthened, established, grounded, and brought into God&rsquo;s eternal glory. That is the ultimate issue of God&rsquo;s dispensing of life.</p><h2 class="head1">IN THE MINISTRY OF JUDE</h2>
<p>Jude was surely a brother under God&rsquo;s dispensing. In Jude there is the matter of building up ourselves in the most holy faith (v. 20). What is faith? It is just the impartation of Christ into us. This is our faith. We all have to be built up in this faith. This is to be built up in the divine life dispensing. Then we can pray in the Holy Spirit and keep ourselves in the love of God as we await the mercy of our Lord (v. 20b-21). Here is the Trinity of the Godhead: the Holy Spirit, God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ. In the holy faith we have the Trinity for our enjoyment. This enjoyment of the Trinity is just to partake of the divine dispensing of life. Eventually this is unto eternal life and will set us before His glory without blemish in exultation (v. 24). To be built up in the faith, to pray in the Holy Spirit, to keep ourselves in the love of God, to await the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, is altogether unto eternal life so that we may be set before God&rsquo;s glory. This indicates clearly that to get involved with the Trinity is to enjoy the dispensing of life which results unto eternal life and the divine glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE MINISTRY OF JAMES</h2>
<p>James also has a few good points. He said that every good and perfect gift comes from the Father of lights (1:17). He also said that the Father of lights is the One who begot us by the Word of truth (v. 18) according to His own will that we should be a kind of firstfruit of His creatures. The firstfruit is surely something of life. Among all the creatures we believers are the first ones to receive and enjoy divine life. Because God has begotten us and we have the eternal life, we are the firstfruits of life among all the created items. We have to respect and thank James because he told us something about God&rsquo;s life dispensing. To beget is to dispense life. When our human father begot us, he dispensed his life into us. When the Father of lights begot us, He dispensed His life into our being to make us a kind of firstfruit among His creatures. This is the begetting for life dispensing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S DISPENSING<br />
IN THE MINISTRY OF JOHN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 1 John 1:1; Rev. 19:13; John 1:18; 3:15-16; 1:34; 20:31; 1 John 1:2; John 11:25; 14:6; 3:34; 1:51; Rev. 1:13; John 1:29; Rev. 5:6; 13:8; 22:1-2; 1 John 2:1-2; Rev. 2:8; 22:13; 3:14; 1:18; 3:7; John 3:36; 1 John 5:12-13, 20; 1:3-7; 2:6, 20, 27; 3:9; 2:29; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 16-21; Rev. 1:9-12, 20; 14:1-5, 15-16; John 3:29; Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2-3, 9, 11, 18-21; 22:14, 17</h1>
<p>In this message we come to the last ministry in the New Testament, the ministry of John. All his writings are so divine and so mysterious. They begin from God in eternity past, and consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity future. So, his writings cover a long span, from eternity past to eternity future.</p>
<p>The subject of John&rsquo;s writings is the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people as the life and life supply to make them all divine to express Him in full for eternity. This is the central message of all the writings of John. The divine reality in the whole universe is revealed in John&rsquo;s writings. The reality, the center, and the content of the entire universe is just that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;wants to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their life and life supply to make them divine to express Him in full and for eternity. This should also be our center, our reality, and our content.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST MINISTERED BY JOHN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">As God in the Beginning</h2>
<p>First of all Christ was ministered by John as God in the beginning (John 1:1). Both Paul and Peter also ministered in this way, pointing out that Christ, the Son of God, is God Himself (Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:8; 2 Pet. 1:1). At the beginning of John&rsquo;s writings, in chapter one of his Gospel he says that Christ is God in the beginning. The beginning means the source. This God is the very source of life. He is also the eternal life (John 3:36). This eternal life is for dispensing. Then, at the end of John&rsquo;s writings, in chapter twenty-two of Revelation, you can see that eternal life is flowing as the river of water of life (22:1). That flowing of life is just the dispensing of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Eternal Logos</h2>
<p>According to John, Christ is the eternal Logos (John 1:1; 1 John 1:1; Rev. 19:13). This is a wonderful term! It means the Word. The Word defines, explains, and expresses God. Who is this One who is the eternal Logos? This is the wonderful Christ, the Second of the Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Only Begotten Son of God</h2>
<p>Christ is the only begotten Son of God (John 1:18; 3:16; 1:34; 20:31). God in eternity is for dispensing life; the eternal Logos is for dispensing life, and the only begotten Son of God, who declared God, is also for dispensing life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>In John&rsquo;s writings Christ is the eternal life (1 John 1:2; John 11:25; 14:6). This is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is not only timewise everlasting, but eternal and divine in nature. Eternal life is just for life dispensing. Life flows, and life dispenses itself. This is the eternal life, so it means an eternal dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Giver of the Spirit</h2>
<p>Christ is also the Giver of the Spirit (John 3:34). The Spirit is the Triune God reaching us. When the Triune God stays in the unapproachable light, He is the Father (1 Tim. 6:16). When He reaches us, He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). The Spirit is just the Triune God reaching us, and Christ is the Giver of such a reaching Spirit. The reaching is the dispensing. When the Triune God reaches us, God dispenses Himself into us. The reaching and dispensing is by the Spirit given to us by Christ the Son.</p><h2 class="head2">As the Son of Man</h2>
<p>Our Christ is the Son of Man (John 1:51; Rev. 1:13). Christ is not only the Son of God with the divine nature, but also the Son of Man with the human nature. He is the Son of Man for redemption, to take away our sin and solve the problems between us and God, that God might be dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Lamb of God</h2>
<p>John ministered Christ as the Lamb of God (John 1:29; Rev. 5:6; 13:8; 22:1). The Lamb of God was not the Son of God, but the Son of Man. God does not have blood to shed for our redemption, nor does the Son of God have blood, but the Lamb, the Son of Man, has blood. This is not the blood of goats or oxen, but the genuine blood of a genuine man which is able to redeem us. Men need a man&rsquo;s blood to redeem them. This redeeming is for the dispensing of God as life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As a Propitiation Concerning Our Sins</h2>
<p>As the Lamb, Christ is the propitiation concerning our sins (1 John 2:2). A propitiation is a kind of appeasing. Because of our sins there was a turmoil, a storm, a problem between God and us. There was no peace. Christ as the Son of Man who was the Lamb of God died on the cross to be our propitiation. He calmed down the storm and the turmoil. He solved the problem. So He is our propitiation. He calmed the turmoil, and He appeased God. So now there is a kind of peaceful condition between God and us. This is for life dispensing. If there is not such a peaceful condition, there is no way to dispense life. When you are going to eat, you must stop any fighting. You cannot eat well if you are quarreling with your wife or with the brothers. If you are quarreling and fighting there is no life dispensing. Eating and life dispensing need a peaceful situation. The Lord Jesus became the propitiation concerning our sins between us and God to create a peaceful situation for the life dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As an Advocate with the Father</h2>
<p>Christ is our Advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1). This means He is our Attorney. He takes our case legally. Satan, the enemy of God and our subtle enemy, is very subtly legal. The Bible tells us that he accuses us before our God day and night (Rev. 12:10). His accusation is somewhat subtly legal. He would say, &ldquo;God, You are righteous. Look at all the children You love. Not one of them is righteous. And You are so holy. But look at Your children; every one is dirty.&rdquo; This kind of accusation is somewhat legal. But God the Father would say, &ldquo;Satan, look at Jesus Christ the righteous One. My children have a good Attorney.&rdquo; Then our Attorney, Jesus Christ, would turn to Satan and say, &ldquo;Satan, don&rsquo;t you see My blood? Satan, shut up! Don&rsquo;t say anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not just my teaching. This is the word in Revelation chapter twelve. According to revelation 12:10 and 11 Satan is accusing God&rsquo;s children day and night. But they can over come him by the blood of the Lamb. Once we realize that we are unclean, unholy, and unrighteous, we are defeated and the life dispensing stops. But we have the blood of Jesus! He is our Advocate, our Attorney. We have to tell Satan, &ldquo;Shut up! Don&rsquo;t say anything!&rdquo; Then we need to praise the Lamb! Hallelujah to the Lamb! Hallelujah for the blood! When we shout Hallelujah! life is dispensed into us once more. Christ, our Advocate, is taking care of our case so that life dispensing can keep going on all the time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Alpha and the Omega</h2>
<p>Our Christ is the Alpha and the Omega (Rev. 22:13a). In the Greek alphabet Christ is the first letter, Alpha, the last letter, Omega, and all the letters in between. He is every letter. In ourselves we are no letter, but we are in Christ. As He is an Alpha, so we are an alpha. As He is an Omega, so we are an omega. He is every letter of the alphabet for the dispensing of life. He is inexhaustible, and His dispensing of life is inexhaustible. He is the Alpha, the Omega, and all the alphabet.</p><h2 class="head2">As the First and the Last</h2>
<p>In John&rsquo;s writing he touches the divine things. With the divine things there is no beginning and no ending because whatever is divine is eternal, having no beginning and no ending. I believe that John purposely wrote his books using these kinds of expressions. He had an intention to show us that whatever he ministered to us is eternal, with no beginning and no ending. So he told us that Christ is the eternal One. He is the first and He is the last (Rev. 2:8; 22:13b). Because He is the first, no one and nothing is before Him. Because He is the last, no one and nothing is after Him. This indicates that He is everything. Christ as the eternal One may be illustrated by a circle which has no beginning and no ending. Christ occupies everything and every place. He does not give you any position. You are nothing, and He is everything. Hallelujah! He is the first and the last. This is also for life dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Beginning and the End</h2>
<p>Christ is not only the first and the last, but also the beginning and the end (Rev. 22:13c). You may be the first, and yet not be the origination. You may be the last, and yet not be the completion. The Lord Jesus is not only the first, but also the beginning, the origination. He is not only the last, but also the end, the completion, leaving nothing to anyone. He occupies the entire universe. In time, in space, and in every thing He is everything. Hallelujah! He is the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, the Origination and the Completion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Beginning of God&rsquo;s Creation</h2>
<p>Christ is also the beginning of God&rsquo;s creation (Rev. 3:14). You have to realize that God&rsquo;s dispensing is to dispense His life into His creature. Who originated the creature? He did! This indicates that the entire creation is under His control, His headship. He is the Beginning, the Origination of God&rsquo;s entire creation, so the entire creation is under His direction for the purpose of dispensing God into His chosen creatures. When you get into the Bible and see all the items of Christ&rsquo;s being, you can see they are just for the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Living One</h2>
<p>In Revelation 1:18 Christ said, &ldquo;I am...the living One, and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.&rdquo; For Christ to dispense life, He must be the living One. A dead person can never dispense life to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Holy One and the True One</h2>
<p>In Revelation 3:7 Christ is revealed as the holy One and the true One. In order to dispense life to others, He must be holy and He must be true. If you are not holy and you are not true, you can never dispense life to others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Faithful and True Witness</h2>
<p>Christ is the faithful and true Witness (Rev. 3:14b). He is the true Witness, and He is faithful and true in testifying. He never tells a lie in His testimony. This also is for dispensing. A liar, a false witness, can never give life to others. If you are going to give life to others, you must be faithful, and you must be true. You must have no falsehood. Then you will be qualified to give life to others. Because He is living and holy and faithful and true, He is qualified to impart life into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Amen</h2>
<p>Revelation 3:14a says that Christ is the Amen. What does amen mean? This is the unique, heavenly, and divine language. I believe when we get into the New Jerusalem we will still speak this kind of language. These two words, hallelujah and amen, are universal. The confusion at Babel destroyed the universal language, but two words were not destroyed, hallelujah and amen. Amen simply means &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; When you say amen you mean &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Oh, the divine dispensation is so wonderful. That&rsquo;s it! Oh, the Triune God dispenses Himself into me. That&rsquo;s it! I am so happy I am in the church life. Amen! That&rsquo;s it! The glorious church life! That&rsquo;s it! It is real, it is yes forever. Amen is a kind of eternal yes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&rdquo; is just Christ Himself. Christ has a name and His name is called Amen&mdash;That&rsquo;s It! This is also for life dispensing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN OF GOD BROUGHT FORTH</h2>
<p>Out of such a Christ ministered, the children of God have been brought forth. The issue of Christ ministered is that many have been born of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Have Eternal Life</h2>
<p>These children first of all have the eternal life (John 3:15, 16, 36; 1 John 1:2; 5:12-13, 20). To have the eternal life simply means to have some living dispensing. Because you have the eternal life, it flows within you. This flowing within you is just the dispensing of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Partake of the Fellowship of the Eternal Life by Abiding in the Lord and<br />
Walking in the Light</h2>
<p>We are partakers of the fellowship of the eternal life by abiding in the Lord and walking in the light (1 John 1:3-7; 2:6). The fellowship is just the flowing. There is a life that flows between God and us. Even between the members of His Body there is such a flow. This flow reaches all of us and even God Himself. So this is a kind of fellowship. Electricity is a good illustration. Within the lamps in a house and within the power plant itself there is the flow of electricity. That flow is the fellowship between all the lamps. The current brings every lamp into the fellowship with the plant. The power plant may be far away from the lamps in the house, but in the current of the electricity, the power plant and the lamps are in one fellowship.</p>
<p>Within us there is a flow. That flow is the eternal life, and that is the fellowship. We all are partaking of such a fellowship. To partake of such a fellowship may not be so substantial as partaking of the divine nature which Peter mentions (2 Pet. 1:4). But this fellowship is more enjoyable. For example, there are two ways to eat chicken: one is to eat the solid chicken, and the other is to eat soup made of chicken. When you are weak or sick, chicken soup is better than chicken. We may use the chicken to illustrate the divine nature, and chicken soup to illustrate the fellowship of the divine life. Which do you prefer? If you are a strong person you may like solid chicken. This is good, but it is more tasteful to eat the chicken soup. Don&rsquo;t forget, the chicken soup comes from chicken. Without a solid chicken, you could not have chicken soup. Likewise, without the divine nature, you could not have the fellowship of the eternal life. The divine nature is the solid thing, the substance. And the fellowship of the divine life is the fellowship of this substance. This is for the life dispensing. The way to partake of the fellowship of the eternal life is to abide in the Lord and walk in the light.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Be Taught by the Divine Anointing</h2>
<p>When you enjoy the fellowship of the eternal life by abiding in the Lord and walking in the light, you are under the teaching of the divine anointing (1 John 2:20, 27). The children of God are also brought forth to be taught by the divine anointing. The anointing may be considered as a kind of oiling. Many machines need to be oiled. If they are not oiled, they do not run smoothly. Instead they make a lot of noise. Sometimes we Christians make a lot of noise, either to our wife, or to our husband, or to the elders, or to the brothers. This means we are short of anointing. We need to get oiled. Hallelujah! We have a source of oil because the anointing is within us. All the time it anoints us. This again is life dispensing. This anointing teaches us, oils us, and regulates us all the time. If we are not regulated by the teaching of the anointing, we are not smooth. The holy anointment oils us, teaches us, and makes us so smooth. This is life dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Enjoy the Virtues of the Divine Birth<br />
with the Divine Seed</h2>
<p>We all have been born of God. We were born not just by our parents but also by God with a divine seed (1 John 3:9). This divine seed is just God&rsquo;s eternal life. There are virtues coming out of this birth and out of this seed. By the virtues of this birth and seed we can practice the divine righteousness (1 John 2:29), we can practice the divine love (1 John 4:7; 5:1), and we can overcome the world, death, sin, the Devil, and idols (1 John 5:4, 16-21). We can overcome everything because we have the virtues of the divine birth with the divine seed. In the spiritual language, virtue means life energy and even life energizing. Within us there is a kind of energy that energizes. This energizing is of the divine life, and the divine life comes from the divine birth. So the life energy, the life energizing, is a virtue. We can overcome the negative things because we have the energizing life. This energizing is just the dispensing of life.</p><h2 class="head2">To Be the Testimony of Jesus&mdash;<br />
The Lampstands as the Expression<br />
of the Triune God</h2>
<p>Then we become the testimony of Jesus. This is the lampstands as the expression of the Triune God (Rev. 1:9-12, 20). The lampstand is just the embodiment of the Triune God. It is made of pure gold, signifying the nature of God the Father. Its shape or form signifies God the Son as the very embodiment of God the Father. It is not a formless piece of gold, but gold in a certain shape or form. The seven lamps shining signify the seven Spirits of God for expression. So the lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God, with God the Father&rsquo;s nature, God the Son&rsquo;s form, and God the Spirit&rsquo;s expression.</p>
<p>Every proper local church is composed with God the Father&rsquo;s nature, God the Son&rsquo;s form, and God the Spirit&rsquo;s expression. This is the golden lampstand, God&rsquo;s embodiment, for God&rsquo;s expression. What a marvelous word concerning the church! Paul&rsquo;s words concerning the church were not this high. Paul told us that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The highest expression Paul used concerning the church is that the church is the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13) and the fullness of God (Eph. 1:23). But John told us that the church is a golden lampstand as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. How we need to see that the church is just the embodiment of the Triune God with the Father&rsquo;s nature, with the Son&rsquo;s form, and the Spirit&rsquo;s expression. If we could see such a vision, it would solve many problems.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Be the Harvest with the Firstfruit<br />
as the Expression of Life</h2>
<p>The church is also a harvest with the firstfruit as the expression of life (Rev. 14:1-5, 15-16). A harvest is just a gathering of all the living produce of the farm. This signifies the maturity of life and the riches of life by life&rsquo;s dispensing. As the church we should be the golden lampstand, and we should also be the harvest with the firstfruit as the expression of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Be the Bride of the Lamb<br />
as His Increase and Satisfaction</h2>
<p>As a golden lampstand and as the harvest with the firstfruit, we also become the Bride of the Lamb as His increase and satisfaction (John 3:29; Rev. 19:7-9). In John 3 Christ is the Bridegroom, and the church is the Bride as His increase. In Revelation 19 the church as the wife, has made herself ready for the marriage of the Lamb for His satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ultimate Consummation of the Dispensing<br />
of the Triune God into Man</h2>
<p>Eventually, there will be the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Triune God into man. This will be the New Jerusalem, the holy city, the tabernacle of God, the Bride, and the wife of the Lamb as the consummate expression of the Triune God (Rev. 21:2-3, 9). When I come to these points I cannot avoid being excited. Hallelujah! Oh, the New Jerusalem! The holy city! The tabernacle! The Bride! The wife!</p>
<p>Such a corporate entity is built with God the Father&rsquo;s nature, signified by the gold, by God the Son&rsquo;s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, signified by the pearls, and by God the Spirit&rsquo;s work of transformation, signified by the precious stones (Rev. 21:11, 18-21).</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem as a consummate expression of the Triune God is supplied and nourished by the Triune God (Rev. 22:1-2, 14, 17). God as the Father is the source, the Spirit as the water of life is the flow, and the Son as the tree of life is the life supply. In Revelation 22 a river of living water flows from the throne of God. Within this river grows the tree of life. This is a clear view of the Triune God in His dispensing. The Father as the source is on the throne with the Lamb because He is the redeeming God, the Lamb-God. There is only one throne, but two are sitting on the one throne. How can two sit on one throne? God the Father as the light is within the Son as the lamp (Rev. 21:23; 22:5). The Father is in the Son, so God is in the Lamb. And the Lamb is the lamp containing God as the light. This is the Lamb-God, the redeeming God. Out of this redeeming God flows the river, signifying the Spirit. In the flow of the river of water of life, the Lamb becomes the tree of life. The Lamb is for redeeming, and the tree is for nourishing. The life-dispensing river circles the entire city as it flows downward from the throne of the Lamb-God in a spiral flowing. This flowing is just the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people as life and life supply in fullness for eternity. This is a city built with the Triune God as the materials and supplied and nourished also by the Triune God as the life supply.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DISPENSING OF THE FATHER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 7:29; 16:27b; 5:24, 30, 36-38, 43; 4:34; 13:20; 14:24; 1:29; 3:14; Rom. 8:3; 1 John 4:10, 9; John 16:32; 8:29; 6:46; 17:8; 14:10-11; 16:15a; Col. 2:9; John 3:16; 14:23; 1 John 3:24; 4:13</h1>
<p>The Gospel of John is a divine writing, and because it is divine, it is mysterious. When we read the Gospel of John, it is easy to pick up many shallow things, things on the surface, but it is not easy to get into the depths to reach the divine reality. There is no religion revealed in this book. Rather, religion is condemned. Nor is there any natural thought or even ethics. What then is revealed in this book? It is hard to say because the things revealed are altogether of the Triune God Himself. No other book in the Bible reveals the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;so clearly and so much in detail as the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>In chapter one, verse 1 God is revealed: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; After chapter one it begins to reveal God the Father. No other book in the Bible uses this term, the Father, so many times as the Gospel of John. First, it reveals the Father, and then it reveals the Son. The Son comes after the Father. Following this it reveals the Spirit. In chapter fourteen the Father is revealed in the Son, and the Son is revealed as one with the Father (vv. 9-10). After this another Comforter is revealed as the Spirit of reality (vv. 16-17).</p>
<p>At the end of the Gospel of John, there is the holy <em>pneuma.</em> After resurrection and in resurrection the Son of God, who went through death and entered into resurrection, came back to His disciples as the <em>pneuma,</em> as the Spirit. He breathed upon His disciples and charged them to receive Him as the <em>pneuma,</em> the Spirit (John 20:22). It is no wonder that some of the great teachers who were studying the Person of Christ picked up a term, the pneumatic Christ, to refer to the very Christ who has become the holy <em>pneuma.</em></p>
<p>So this Gospel presents us a clear picture of the Triune God&mdash;God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Eventually the holy <em>pneuma,</em> the Holy Spirit, reaches us not objectively, but subjectively by entering into our very being. He enters into us as the Spirit. After He entered into the disciples in John 20, He never left them. This is why there is no official ascension of Christ in the Gospel of John. Both Mark and Luke record the visible ascension of Christ (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:51). In both of these Gospels the disciples saw Christ ascending to the heavens. That was His visible and official ascension. But the Gospel of John does not record such an ascension. Where did the resurrected Christ go? He went into the disciples. Even now He is still in His believers.</p>
<p>This Gospel also does not have a conclusion. There is no ending because the resurrected Christ still lives on this earth in His believers. Today the Gospel of John has many more chapters in it, and the chapters are still going on. This is because the wonderful One who is God and the Father and the Son and the Spirit, and who is now the pneumatic Christ, lives within us. His living from the day of resurrection has never stopped. It is still going on today; He is with us and even within us.</p>
<p>This is too divine! And because it is too divine, it is also too mysterious! Although His living within us is divine and mysterious, it is a reality. The word reality is a translation of the Greek word <em>aletheia.</em> It has been translated by most versions of the Bible into &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; Actually, in John it should not be rendered truth because the word truth is ambiguous. It may mean reality, or it may mean a fact, or it may mean true doctrine. But in the Gospel of John it surely does not mean true doctrine. John 1:17 says, &ldquo;For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; If the word truth simply refers to true doctrine, then the verse would read that the law was given through Moses; grace and true doctrine came through Jesus Christ. This rendering, of course, does not give the proper meaning. In the Gospel of John this word means reality.</p>
<p>We were made as vessels to contain God (Rom. 9:21, 23). If we don&rsquo;t have the Triune God as our content, we are just an empty container, an empty shell. Without God, even the entire universe, including the heavens and the earth, becomes an empty, universal shell. Without God nothing is real; everything is vanity. It is no wonder that the wise King Solomon said that under the sun there was nothing but vanity (Eccl. 1:14). The reality, the real content, and the real meaning of the entire universe is God. God is also the real content and the real meaning of our being. If we do not have God within us as our content, we do not have the reality. According to the Bible, God is reality, the Son of God is reality, the Spirit of God is reality, the Word of God is reality, the entire Bible in its content is reality, and even our belief which we hold is a reality.</p>
<p>Now I would like to call your full attention to this word dispensing. This is not a new word in the dictionary, but it may be a new word to Christian ears. Before you came to the recovery, you probably had never heard a message using this word dispensing concerning the Divine Trinity. But you probably had heard another word, dispensation, which is very similar to dispensing. What is the difference between dispensing and dispensation? First of all, the word dispensation is the noun form of the verb dispense. The first connotation of the word dispensation is that it equals dispensing. But in theology the word dispensation has not been used in this meaning. Second, dispensation means God&rsquo;s way of dealing with people. Third, dispensation is a kind of plan or arrangement. In this connotation dispensation becomes an equivalent to the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which is anglicized into the English word economy. This refers to God&rsquo;s plan, arrangement, household administration, and household management. The first part of the word, <em>oikos,</em> means house or household. The last part of the word, <em>nomia,</em> means a law to regulate the house. So it means the household administration, the household management. This is an administration, an arrangement, a plan to work out a certain project. This is the right meaning of the word dispensation used in theological teachings. It is used to denote the different ways by which God deals with mankind.</p>
<p>We may consider that from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 there are seven ways for God to deal with human beings. The first dispensation is that of innocence, from the creation of man until the fall of man. The second is that of conscience, from the fall of man until the time in Genesis 9. The third is the dispensation of human government which was instituted at Noah&rsquo;s time. The fourth is the dispensation of promise which was from the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob until the law. Following this is the dispensation of the law, which was from Moses until Christ. After this comes the dispensation of grace, which is during the church age. Eventually there is the dispensation of the kingdom, the thousand years of the millennium. These are the seven ways or the seven aspects of God&rsquo;s dealing with man. This is the meaning of the word dispensation.</p>
<p>We do not use the word dispensation, because it may be misunderstood. We use the word dispensing. Dispensing means to distribute. God dispenses Himself to you just as you may dispense food to your guests. Many readers of the Bible have realized that in the Gospel of John the Father is revealed, the Son is revealed, and the Spirit is revealed. But not many have realized that in the Gospel of John the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is revealed for the dispensing of Himself into us first as life, then as life supply, and then as everything. I did not realize this matter of God dispensing Himself into us until about twenty years ago. From that time onward I have used this word dispense very much. God dispenses Himself into His children. It is not too hard to understand.</p>
<p>Chapter one of John says, &ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God&rdquo; (vv. 12-13). These children of God were born of God. When a child is born of a father, what does it indicate? It indicates that the father has dispensed his life into the child. At the very beginning there was only one man, Adam, yet today there are millions of human beings on the earth. Through all the generations Adam&rsquo;s life has been dispensed into his descendants. This is a proper understanding of the word dispensing.</p>
<p>In this message we will cover the dispensing of the Father, and in the following messages we will cover the dispensing of the Son, the dispensing of the Spirit, and the consummation of the divine dispensing. I would beg you to dive into all the Scripture reading. Apparently some of the verses are small verses. For example, John 7:29 says, &ldquo;I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.&rdquo; Apparently this verse is not as big as John 3:16, which says that God so loved the world. But actually this kind of expression&mdash;I am from Him, and He sent Me&mdash;is too great! Just consider, who is the I in this verse? This is Christ, but who is Christ? By going back to chapter one of this Gospel we can find out that Christ is God.</p>
<p>Consider also where Christ came from. He said that He was from the Father (John 6:46) and that the Father sent Him (John 5:36). Not many Christians are clear that Christ, the Son of God, came from the Father. According to people&rsquo;s natural mentality, Christ came from heaven. Have you ever thought that Christ came from the Father? His source was the Father.</p><h2 class="head1">AS THE SOURCE, THE INITIATOR</h2>
<p>The Father is the very source, the initiator, because the Son came out from Him (John 7:29; 16:27b). In John 16:27 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God.&rdquo; It does not only say that I came <em>from</em> Him, but that I came <em>out from</em> Him. The Son came out of a source, and that source was the Father. So the Father is the source, and He is the initiator. He is even the initiation, the origination. The entire universe was initiated in this initiation, who is a divine Person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SENDING THE SON</h2>
<p>This source, this initiator, sent the Son (John 5:24, 30, 36-38; 13:20; 14:24). There are two Greek words used for the English word sent, one of which means to be sent with a special commission. This indicates that the source, the Father, sent the Son as an envoy with a special commission. The Son was sent by the Father with a particular commission to do three main categories of things.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Condemn Sin in the Likeness<br />
of the Flesh of Sin</h2>
<p>First of all, the Father sent the Son to take away sin, to condemn sin. And in order to do this, according to 2 Corinthians 5:21, the Son, who knew no sin, even became sin. Actually, He became only the likeness of the flesh of sin. He did not have the sinful nature. This is clearly illustrated by the brass serpent in John 3:14. The brass serpent did bear the form and appearance and likeness of a real serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent.</p>
<p>Romans 8:3 says that the law was impossible in that it was weak through the flesh, so God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. This is just like the brass serpent being in the likeness of a poisonous serpent. The Son was sent in the likeness of the flesh of sin to condemn sin. Sin has been condemned. Sin is something which is in the universe among the human race, but it has been condemned. The divine government has condemned sin. You don&rsquo;t need to be bothered by sin. When the law became a failure, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin to condemn sin. This is the meaning of John 1:29: &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; Sin in this verse is in the singular number, and the world here means mankind. The Son of God was sent by the Father to accomplish such a commission, that is, to solve the problem of sin, to take away sin, to condemn sin through His death on the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Be a Propitiation Concerning Our Sins</h2>
<p>Not only do we have sin in our nature, but we also have a lot of sins in our conduct. So God sent His Son to be a propitiation for our sins (1 John 4:10). He has condemned sin in our nature; He has become the propitiation to deal with all our sins, offenses, and trespasses. Every sin, every offense, and every trespass makes a problem between us and God. So between us and God there is a lot of turmoil. But the dear Son of God died on the cross for our sins and became the propitiation to calm down every turmoil. To propitiate simply means to make peace. You have a problem with God, and you have no way to make peace, but the Son of God became the propitiation to appease God and calm every turmoil between you and God. So He has condemned sin and calmed down the turmoil caused by our sins. Now we have peace with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Impart the Divine Life into Us</h2>
<p>The Son of God was also sent by the Father to impart life into us (1 John 4:9). In his one Gospel, John uses three illustrations concerning the death of Christ: the Lamb of God (1:29), the brass serpent (3:14), and a grain of wheat (12:24). The Lamb of God and the brass serpent are for dealing with sin and our sinful nature, but the grain of wheat is for life imparting. The grain of wheat dies in order to produce many grains. It dies to impart its life into many grains. The Son has been sent by the Father with such a threefold commission: to take away our sin, to propitiate concerning our sins, and then to impart the divine life into all His believers that they may be born of God.</p><h2 class="head1">COMING WITH THE SON</h2>
<p>The Father sent the Son, and He came with the Son (John 17:8 and note 2). We do not have the ability to explain this. As a rule when I send you, and you go for me, I stay home. But when the Father sent the Son, it was not like this. When He sent the Son, He came with the Son. The Greek preposition <em>para</em> means not only &ldquo;from&rdquo; but &ldquo;from with.&rdquo; In his note on John 6:46, J. N. Darby says that <em>para</em> means from with. This indicates that when the Son came, He came with the Father. The Father sent the Son, and He came with the Son. In John 16:32 the Lord said, &ldquo;Behold, an hour is coming and has come, when you shall be scattered each to his own, and shall leave Me alone; and I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.&rdquo; Here the Lord told us clearly that He was not alone, but the Father who sent Him was with Him. The Lord had previously spoken the same kind of word in 8:29: &ldquo;And He Who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING AND WORKING IN THE SON</h2>
<p>The Father not only comes with the Son, but after the Son comes to live and work on the earth, the Father lives with Him and works with Him. When He lives, the Father lives. When He works, the Father works. The Gospel of John tells us clearly that while the Son speaks, the Father works (14:10-11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING ALL THAT HE HAS TO THE SON,<br />
THUS EMBODIED IN THE SON</h2>
<p>Before the Lord Jesus went to the cross to die, He spoke to His disciples in this way: &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you&rdquo; (John 16:15). This verse indicates that whatever the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s. The Son does not come in His own name; He comes in the Father&rsquo;s name (John 5:43). The Son does not seek His own will, but seeks the Father&rsquo;s will (John 5:30). He does not speak His own word; He speaks the Father&rsquo;s word (John 14:24), and He does the Father&rsquo;s work (John 4:34), not His own work. Who is He? He is the Son with the Father. The Father was with the Son, and the Father gave everything to the Son. Thus, the Father was embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING THE SON TO US</h2>
<p>After the Father gave all that He had to the Son and was thus embodied in the Son, He gave the Son to us (John 3:16). We have been given not only the Son, but the Son with the Father. The Father is with the Son, and the Father has given Himself to the Son. So when the Father gives the Son to us, we have both.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DWELLING IN US WITH THE SON BY THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The consummation of the dispensing of the Father is that the Father abides in us with the Son by the Spirit (John 14:23; 1 John 3:24; 4:13). The Father can never abide in us just by Himself. He abides in us with the Son and by the Spirit. When One comes, we have all Three. This is the Father in the Son by the Spirit. We all need a vision to see this! God&rsquo;s economy is to reveal Himself as the Father with the Son by the Spirit as a living Person. This divine Person has become a gift to you. This divine gift can never be exhausted. He is in you, He is abiding in you, He is dwelling in you to be your life, your life supply, and your everything.</p>
<p>You do not need any religious teaching. Life does not need any teaching. There is no need to educate a peach tree so that it will not bring forth bananas. As the peach tree grows it will bring forth peaches, not bananas. The Gospel of John does not teach us how to behave ourselves. In this Gospel we are charged first to believe in Him, and then to love Him. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo; (John 14:23). This is to dwell in us to be our life.</p>
<p>Regardless of how many life-messages you have studied and how many conferences you have attended, I am afraid that, unconsciously, you have a natural religious thought still remaining in you. You still want to improve yourself, to do better, to adjust yourself, to correct yourself. This is the leaven we have inherited from our background. My burden is to unload you from all this leaven. May the Lord enlighten your inner man that you may see. He does not want to correct you. He wants to regenerate you. He wants to transform you. He wants to live in you as your life, as your life supply, and as your everything.</p>
<p>First, the Father comes with the Son, and then He abides in you with the Son by the Spirit. When He abides in you, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;abide in you to be your life, your life supply, and your everything. You don&rsquo;t need to adjust yourself. You don&rsquo;t need to improve yourself. You need the Father abiding in you with the Son by the Spirit. Hallelujah! We have the Father, and we have the Son and the Spirit. We have the Triune God abiding in us! May we all see such a vision. This is the Father&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>All the points covered in this message&mdash;the source, the sending, the coming with the Son, the living and working in the Son, the giving of all that the Father has to the Son, the giving the Son to us, and the dwelling in us with the Son by the Spirit&mdash;are for the dispensing of the Father Himself into our being. Hallelujah! We have such a dispensing within us. The Father abides in us with the Son by the Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<p>The Gospel of John is particular in the divine dispensation. In it we cannot find that the Lord had any intention merely to teach us what to do or what not to do. Rather, the Lord discloses that the Trinity of the Godhead wants to dispense Himself into our being. Humanly speaking, we don&rsquo;t have such a concept. We have the concept of culture, religion, ethics, or good character. Even we have the concept of how to worship God and please Him. But this book shows us that all these concepts are obstacles to the divine revelation.</p>
<p>The story of the Samaritan woman in chapter four shows that even our worship to God may veil us from knowing and seeing the real God. In her conversation with the Lord Jesus, she turned the subject to the worship of God. Then He showed her that the genuine worship is in our spirit and by the reality (4:24). Reality is just Christ Himself as the very means by which we worship God. If in our worship to God, there is no element of Christ, that worship is vanity and even becomes a veil to keep us from seeing the real worship. How we need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to drop all the things we have picked up in our past! All those items have become veils to us, keeping us from seeing God, from seeing Christ, from seeing the Spirit, and from seeing the divine reality.</p>
<p>On the positive side, this book shows us the divine revelation concerning the Triune God being dispensed into our being. On the negative side, it shows us the veils&mdash;religion, human thought, natural concepts, and even concepts concerning the worship of God. Surely the revelation of such a book demands that we drop everything. Don&rsquo;t leave any veils on your eyes or in your mentality. You have to say, &ldquo;Lord, unload me and rescue me. I want to drop all the old things.&rdquo; We need an empty spirit to receive something new, something fresh, something up-to-date, something that is the genuine revelation in the holy Word.</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of John at least three things frustrate the dispensing of the Son. First is religion. We have been born into religion, and religion is in our blood. We cannot stay away from religion because religion is within us. The second frustration is ethics. We cannot stay away from the thought of being a good person. The husbands want to be the best husbands. The wives want to be the best wives. The mothers want to be the best mothers. Third, we cannot stay away from our natural thinking. We all have our natural thinking. Philosophy is just the development of our natural thinking. Some people are small in their natural thinking, and others are great. The philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Confucius were great in their natural thinking. The development of their natural thinking produced a philosophy. Not one person is without philosophy. Philosophy is just a kind of logic. Even a small child has his logic. That is his philosophy. Why do the little children sometimes reason and argue? It is because they have their philosophy. It is really hard for us to stay away from these three things: religion, ethics, and natural thinking. Yet we must realize these are hindrances, coverings, veils, to us.</p>
<p>All three of these matters are covered in the Gospel of John. In chapter eleven Martha was full of natural thinking. Natural thinking is just the expression of yourself. She expressed a lot of herself. That was a big hindrance to the resurrection life. In this chapter religion and the expression of self in the natural thinking were a strong frustration to the vitality of the resurrection life. She told the Lord, &ldquo;If you were here, my brother would not have died&rdquo; (John 11:21). In verse 25 Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus Himself is the resurrection and the life. It is not a matter of time and space. But Martha expounded the Lord&rsquo;s word from the present time to the resurrection in the last day. Martha&rsquo;s problem was her natural concept. This was Martha. What about yourself? If you would not prepare yourself by dropping your religion, ethics, and natural thinking, you will be unable to get much from this message. Rather, your situation will still be a thick veil upon you.</p>
<p>The revelation of God&rsquo;s divine economy is this: the Divine Trinity wants to work Himself into your being. For this reason, God created us as vessels (Rom. 9:21, 23). We were made in the image of God so that we might contain God. The form of a container is always according to what is to be contained. If something is square, its container also needs to be in the form of a square. If something is round, its container needs to be round. For God to create us in His image means that He created us in His form. This was a preparation so that God could be contained in His created man.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s image is the expression of what He is. God is love, God is light, God is holy, and God is righteous. Although the Ten Commandments are ten laws, actually they are a testimony of God. They testify what kind of God He is. God gave the Ten Commandments according to what He is. He is love, He is light, He is holy, and He is righteous.</p>
<p>Man was made according to God, in the image of God, so in man&rsquo;s created nature there is the element of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Even after we have fallen, these elements are still within us as the very constituent of our ethical thinking. Just as a glove is made in the form of a hand to contain a hand, so our human ethical elements, such as love, holiness, and righteousness, are containers to contain the divine love, holiness, and righteousness.</p>
<p>Because of the fall, however, man became independent of God. Ethical teachings help you to develop your human virtues without God. Whenever you try to be ethical, this is independence from God. When you, by yourself, try to be a good husband or wife, that means you are being independent from God. You try to be a good wife or husband without God. We must admit we are still very ethical.</p>
<p>In the past few years, though, my confession to the Lord has not been concerning the matter of ethics. My confession was because I didn&rsquo;t live Christ. I may not have made any mistake for the whole day; I may not have offended anyone; I may not have had any trespass. But for the whole day I lived Christ very little. We must see that what the Lord wants in us is not merely ethics. What the Lord wants is for Him to live in us and for us to live Him.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John has a particular character and touches a particular thing: the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is endeavoring to work Himself into the very being of His chosen people, that all of His chosen people may live a life, not of religion, nor of ethics, but of the Triune God. Of course, the Triune God is much higher than any kind of ethics. The highest ethics is God Himself. He wants us to have a life that lives the Triune God as life. We must be able to say that our life and living is the Triune God. If you still hold on to a religious concept, an ethical concept, or some concept of your natural thinking, you cannot fully enter into the Gospel of John. You must pray, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me! Take away my religious concepts, my ethical concepts, my natural thinking. Remove all the coverings.&rdquo; Then you are ready to see something. Now let us come to the dispensing of the Son.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPRESSION, THE ACCOMPLISHER</h2>
<p>The Father is the source, and the Son is the expression, the accomplisher (John 1:18; Heb. 1:3). The source and the expression are not two things, but one thing with two aspects. It has the aspect of the source and the aspect of the expression. The Father as the source is the initiator. He initiated all things, including the planning. The Son, as the expression, is the accomplisher. Whatever the Father planned, the Son accomplished. So the Son is the accomplisher.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING IN THE FATHER&rsquo;S NAME</h2>
<p>The Son was sent by the Father, and He came in the Father&rsquo;s name (John 5:43). By reading the Gospel of John you could see that the Lord Jesus never did anything in His own name. He always did everything in the Father&rsquo;s name. This point is marvelous! But it is not easy to understand. Let me illustrate it in this way: as a husband, you like to be a good husband. Surely you have made up your mind to be a good husband. But let me ask: When you made up your mind to be a good husband, did you do it in the name of Christ? In whose name did you make up your mind? Probably you would have to say in your own name. Although we have been redeemed, and regenerated, and even though we may love the Lord very much, yet we do nearly everything in our own name. We do very few things in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Sometimes at the end of our prayer we may say, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus.&rdquo; Some have said that we are not qualified to pray, so we should not sign our name at the end of our prayer. They say this is like putting your signature on a check, but having no deposit in the bank under this name. So the check can never be honored. You had better put the signature of Jesus. When the heavenly bank sees this check, it will honor it right away. So at the end of every prayer, we should say, &ldquo;In the name of Jesus.&rdquo; No, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that. What does it mean? Paul said, &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20). This means Paul lived in the name of Christ. This is like Christ not coming in His own name, but in the Father&rsquo;s name. He was the Son, yet He came not in the Son&rsquo;s name, but in the Father&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The name Christian was given by outsiders in ancient times as a kind of nickname because the early saints lived, not in their own name, but in the name of Christ. In other words, they did not live themselves. They lived Christ. So in the eyes of the outsiders, they were Christ. They were Christ-men. Christian simply means a Christ-man, a man who lives Christ.</p>
<p>When the Son came He did not simply represent the Father. When He came, the Father came (John 6:46). He came in the Father&rsquo;s name; He lived the Father. This is just for the Father&rsquo;s dispensing in the Son and through the Son. When you have the Son, you have the Father, because the Father came in the Son&rsquo;s coming. When the Son brought the Father to His believers, it was for the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO TABERNACLE AMONG THE DISCIPLES</h2>
<p>This wonderful One came to tabernacle among men (John 1:14; 16:4b). The tabernacle, of course, is a figure of speech, and to understand it, you have to study the tabernacle in Exodus. In Exodus there was a tabernacle which typified God incarnated in humanity. The building elements in the tabernacle&mdash;acacia wood overlaid with gold&mdash;show humanity and divinity. Wood signifies humanity, and gold signifies divinity. In the tabernacle divinity is joined to humanity, and humanity is overlaid with divinity. The tabernacle signifies God in humanity.</p>
<p>This very God as the tabernacle is enterable. When God remains in His divinity, He is not approachable. In His divinity, He dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). But He became incarnated in the flesh, and this incarnate God in the flesh becomes the enterable tabernacle. In the ancient days, the priests could enter into the tabernacle, which was a type of God incarnated. So the incarnated God, the very divinity in humanity, now becomes enterable. His redeemed people, His priests, His serving ones, can enter into Him and dwell in Him and enjoy Him. The Son of God came not just to dwell among us, but to tabernacle. If He had come only to dwell among us, we could never enter into Him to dwell in Him. But He came to tabernacle among us. He becomes our dwelling place. We can enter into Him.</p>
<p>What, or who, is the tabernacle? Chapter one of John says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (vv. 1, 14). Here is one entity, the tabernacle, that signifies the Word, the Triune God, and the Triune God in the flesh. How wonderful! This One is full of grace and reality. This is the dispensing of the Trinity, first in the Father, and then in the Son. The tabernacle signifies not only the Son, but also the very Triune God in the flesh.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, but they are not separate. Why are they not separate? It is because the Son, when He was sent by the Father, came with the Father (John 6:46). He not only came with the Father, but He also said that He was in the Father, and the Father was in Him (John 14:10-11). The Father sent the Son, and the Son came with the Father. Otherwise, the Son could never have been the tabernacle. The Son had to be all-inclusive so that He could be the tabernacle, the enterable God. I know that this kind of expression, the enterable God, is new to you. You have heard of the almighty God and the omnipresent God, but you probably have never heard of the enterable God. Just to know that He is almighty and omnipresent does not mean so much, but to know that He is enterable means a lot. By tabernacling among us, our God became enterable.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT ONLY COEXISTING, BUT ALSO<br />
COINHERING WITH THE FATHER</h2>
<p>Christ the Son not only coexists, but also coinheres with the Father. In the Gospel of John we are told that in eternity past the Son and the Father coexisted, because the Word was with God (John 1:1). When the Son came, He said that He was not alone, that the Father was with Him (John 8:16, 29). So while He was on earth, He and the Father were existing together. But on the other hand, the Lord said that He was in the Father, and the Father was in Him (John 14:10a, 11a; 17:21). Some have said that the Son and the Father are separate, and that the Son just represents the Father. But the Lord said if you have seen Me, you have seen the Father (John 14:9). This is not a matter of representation; this is a matter of embodiment. The Father is totally embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9). When you see the Son, you see the Father, because the Son is the embodiment of the Father. You cannot separate them because the First is embodied in the Second, and the Second is the very embodiment of the First. So the Second is in the First, and the First is in the Second. The two are one.</p>
<p>This is not for doctrine, but for experience on our side and for dispensing on His side. When we called on the Lord and were saved, right away we had the realization that Someone had come into our being. Who was that? Was it the Father, or the Son, or the Spirit? It is hard to say. First, it seems the Son is in us; later it seems the Father is also in us; eventually it seems the Spirit is in us as well. As long as we have the Spirit, we also have the Son and the Father. When we have one, we have three, because the Three are one. This is the dispensing of the Triune God, and this is for our experience.</p>
<p>The Triune God has been dispensed into us. This very Triune God now has to be our very living. We need to forget about so many other things. Our life and our living should not be religion or ethics, but the Triune God. We must live the Triune God. Today this Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is within us as our life.</p>
<p>Christians today may talk about the Trinity, but after talking, they forget about it and live in their own name. They don&rsquo;t live in the name they talk about. We must live in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Spirit. We should not live in our own name. As long as we live in the name of the Triune God, our living will be marvelous! It will be holy and righteous and even divine. This is much more than being religious or ethical. This is living the Triune God. &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21), not religion, not ethics, and not even the so-called Pentecostal power. Some Christians claim to have the Pentecostal power, but Paul claimed to have the One who empowered him (Phil. 4:13).</p>
<p>Our Christian life should not be religion or ethics or power, but the Triune God. It should be no more I, but Christ lives in me (Gal. 2:20). Some of the brothers in this country have listened to me since 1963. They can testify that I have never changed my tune, because this is the unique thing that the Lord is going to recover today. And this is the unique thing that we need as Christians who love the Lord. We need to see such a vision that in God&rsquo;s economy He doesn&rsquo;t want something else; He only wants to work Himself into our being. Christ the Son coexists and coinheres with the Father so that He with the Father might be dispensed into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE WITH THE FATHER</h2>
<p>As the Son and the Father are coinhering, they are one (John 10:30; 17:22). The Son is one with the Father. This is a mystery which I cannot explain. They are just one. Because they are one, when you see the First, you see the Second.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING BECAUSE OF THE FATHER</h2>
<p>In John 6:57, Christ the Son said that He lived because of the Father. The King James Version reads that He lived through the Father. These are two different translations of the Greek preposition <em>dia.</em> But according to the grammatical structure, it should read because of, not through. This is more meaningful. The Son lived on earth not just by the Father or through the Father, but because of the Father. His living had a cause. That cause was the Father. The Father was the cause of the Son&rsquo;s living on earth; the Father was not just an instrument through or by which the Son lived.</p>
<p>Today this very Son should be the cause of our daily living. We should live not only by Him and through Him, but because of Him. He should be the cause of our living on earth. Otherwise, our living would be meaningless. Without the Father as His cause, the Son&rsquo;s living on earth for thirty-three and a half years would have been altogether vain. But it was not in vain, because the Son&rsquo;s living had a cause, and this cause was the Father.</p><h2 class="head1">WORKING IN THE FATHER&rsquo;S NAME<br />
AND WITH THE FATHER</h2>
<p>The Son was working in the Father&rsquo;s name (John 10:25) and with the Father (John 5:17, 19). This means when the Son was working, He was working with the Father as one. He and the Father were not working separately. In John 14:10b He said, &ldquo;The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works.&rdquo; While the Son was speaking, the Father was working. This is not two working on the same thing at the same time separately, but two working as one. When the Son spoke the word, the Father was doing the work. The Son&rsquo;s speaking was the Father&rsquo;s working.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING THE FATHER&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>The Lord told us in John 6:38 that He came down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father who sent Him. In John 5:30 He said that He did not seek His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him. These words indicate that the Lord as the Son did not carry out His own will but the Father&rsquo;s.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE FATHER&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>In John 3:34a; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50, the Lord made clear to us that when He, as the Son, came He did not speak His own word, but the word of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEKING THE FATHER&rsquo;S GLORY</h2>
<p>The Son was also seeking the Father&rsquo;s glory (John 7:18). The Son came in the Father&rsquo;s name, He did the Father&rsquo;s will, He spoke the Father&rsquo;s word, and He sought the Father&rsquo;s glory. It seems that the Son had nothing for Himself, but everything for the Father. Then who is He? He is the wonderful Son who is the embodiment of the Father. The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Col. 2:9). He is the embodiment of the Godhead. This is for the dispensing of Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPRESSING THE FATHER</h2>
<p>The Son who came in the Father&rsquo;s name, who did the Father&rsquo;s will, who spoke the Father&rsquo;s word, and who sought the Father&rsquo;s glory also expressed the Father (John 14:7-9). He did not express Himself. He only expressed the Father. He was the Son, yet He expressed the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SENDING THE SPIRIT FROM WITH THE FATHER</h2>
<p>As the expression of the Father, the Son sent the Spirit from with the Father (John 15:26 and note; 16:7). Why did the Son send the Spirit from with the Father? This is the Trinity! The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and He sent the Spirit from with the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING THE SPIRIT TO US</h2>
<p>John 3:34 tells us that the Son gives the Spirit to us. After sending the Spirit, the Son gives the Spirit to us without measure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING THE SPIRIT THROUGH<br />
DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Eventually, through death and resurrection, the Son became the Spirit (John 20:19-23). First, the Son sent the Spirit; then He gave the Spirit; and eventually He became the Spirit. As the last Adam, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Hence, the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This is for the dispensing of Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN US AS THE SPIRIT WITH THE FATHER</h2>
<p>Finally, the Son is abiding in us as the Spirit with the Father. In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said that the Father and He would come to the lover of Him and make their abode with him. This means that the Father and the Son come together to abide in the believers. By the foregoing verses, verses 16-20, we can see that the Son would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality. When this Spirit of reality would come, He would not only be with the believers, but also in the believers. Eventually the Lord indicated in verse 18 that the coming One, the Spirit of reality, is actually just Himself. Finally, He said in verse 20, in that day, the day of resurrection, they would know that He was in the Father, and they were in Him, and He was in them. Not only would the Spirit of reality be in them, but even He would be in them. This indicates that He and the Spirit are actually one. Then in chapter seventeen in His prayer to the Father, the Lord Jesus said twice, &ldquo;I in them&rdquo; (vv. 23, 26). What is all this? All this is God the Father dispensing Himself into us through God the Son and in God the Son and by God the Spirit. So the entire Godhead&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is now abiding in us to be one with us. Now in the divine life and in the divine nature He is making us His expression. As genuine Christians we should live a life that lives the Triune God. This is not a life that has anything to do with religion or that expresses ethics. It is a life that purely lives the Triune God and expresses Him. This is the dispensing of the Triune God into us to produce many children of God and many brothers of Christ, so that the Father may have a house, that Christ may have a Body, and that the Spirit may have an organism to express the Triune God. It has nothing to do with religion, with human ethics, or with man&rsquo;s natural concept and philosophy. It is altogether the dispensing of the Triune God into us for His expression.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DISPENSING OF THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:17; 20:22; 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:14-15; 14:23; Rom. 8:9-11; John 7:38-39</h1>
<p>The first two verses of the Gospel of John mention God, but they do not mention the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in clear words. Then in the following chapters the mystery of the Father is gradually disclosed. The Father is really a mystery! Why is God called the Father? Whose Father is He? If you say that He is the Father of the Son, this brings in a deeper mystery. In chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen, the Father is mentioned again and again. The Son is also mentioned (14:13), and the Son said that He would pray to the Father, asking the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality. So the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all are mysterious.</p>
<p>The Lord talked to His disciples in John 14:16-20, indicating that the Comforter who would come was just Himself in another form. In verse 17 the Lord said that the Spirit of reality abides with them and shall be in them. Then in verse 18 He said, &ldquo;I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.&rdquo; This indicates that when the Comforter comes, it is the coming of the Son. In verse 17 He said that the Spirit of reality shall be in them, and in verse 20 He said, &ldquo;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; According to these verses, it would seem that there are two in us, the Spirit of reality and the Lord Jesus Himself. But according to our experience there are not two, but one.</p>
<p>John 14:17 tells us that the Spirit is in us. Verse 20 tells us that Christ the Son is in us, and verse 23 tells us that both the Son and the Father will come to us and make an abode with us. Ephesians 4:6 says there is &ldquo;one God and Father of all, Who is over all and through all and in all.&rdquo; So the Spirit is in us, the Son is in us, and the Father also is in us. Then how many are in us, three or one? The wisest way to answer is that the Triune God is in us. Triune simply means three-one. Of course, in our human mathematics we do not have such a number. We have three, and we have one, but we don&rsquo;t have three-one. But in the divine mathematics there is such a number. We don&rsquo;t have three in us; we have three-one in us.</p>
<p>This same principle can be found in the book of Revelation. There the Spirit of God who, no doubt, is the one unique Spirit of God, is called the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 3:1). Is God&rsquo;s Spirit one or seven? You have to answer that God&rsquo;s Spirit is seven-one. Of course, we do not understand such divine mathematics. If we understood, we would be God. Our God is three-one, and His Spirit is seven-one.</p>
<p>The very God upon whom the entire universe is focused is not a single God; He is triune. Both the Old and New Testaments use plural pronouns in referring to the Triune God. In Genesis 1:26 God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&rdquo; Here the plural pronouns, us and our, are used. Then in John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; Who are the We? The Father and the Son. So our God is triune. The entire universe is focused on God, and He is triune: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</p>
<p>Some Christian teachers, in their teaching concerning the Trinity, separate the Father from the Son, and they separate both the Father and the Son from the Spirit. In their teaching they say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three persons, not only distinct but also separate. Many Christians realize the Trinity in this way: the Father is sitting on the throne in heaven, and the Son is sitting on the Father&rsquo;s right hand. So both the Father and the Son are in heaven, and the Spirit has come down to the earth. This means in their concept one-third of the Godhead is on the earth, and two-thirds of the Godhead are in heaven. I am afraid that you also may still have this kind of concept. This wrong teaching is a leavened truth. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;the Triune God&mdash;is a truth in the Bible, but it has been leavened. Leaven is added to wheat flour to make the bread soft and edible. In like manner, leaven has been added to the truth in the Bible to make it easier to understand and to take. Don&rsquo;t hold the concept that the Trinity of the Godhead could be divided into three separate persons. This is leaven. Although God is triune, He is one. The Father is not separate from the Son, nor from the Spirit. The Spirit is not separate from the Son, nor from the Father. The Three have never been separated. The Three coexist and coinhere all the time. When One is here, all Three are here. When One is in heaven, all are in heaven. The Three are always one. There is no separation. This is a mystery as revealed in the Scriptures for dispensing the Triune God into us.</p>
<p>Suppose the Bible only revealed God as the unique God, God the Creator, not the Triune God. If there were no Father and no Son and no Spirit, how could God dispense Himself into us? For God to dispense Himself into us is not a small thing, nor is it so simple. We are fallen, and we have the problems of sin, the world, and Satan. How could these things be taken away? There is the need of someone to condemn sin, to judge the world, and to cast out Satan. In the divine dispensing this someone is the Son. The Son was sent by the Father to condemn sin, to judge the world, and to cast out Satan through His death on the cross. In order to die on the cross, He needed to put on humanity. How could God without blood and flesh be crucified on the cross to shed blood for the forgiveness of sins? It would be impossible. So the Son had to put on blood and flesh so that He could go to the cross and die in a physical way (Heb. 2:14). He put on humanity so that He could shed human blood to wash away our sins. He judged the world and He cast out Satan (John 12:31).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if God were only God, how could He enter into us? In order to enter into us, God must be the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit is the holy breath for us to take in (John 20:22).</p>
<p>These illustrations may help you to realize that the matter of the Triune God is not merely for teaching, but is for dispensing. Doctrinally we may not fully understand the Triune God, but in experience we can testify that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us. This is for experience on our side, and this is for dispensing on His side.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ENTERING IN, THE APPLIER</h2>
<p>The Father is the source, the initiator, the Son is the expression, the accomplisher, and the Spirit is the entering in, the applier (John 14:17). The Father sent the Son (John 8:29), and the Son came with the Father (John 16:32). The Son sent the Spirit (John 16:7), and the Spirit came from with the Father (John 15:26) in the name of the Son (John 14:26). By this you can see that the Father by Himself cannot reach us, nor can the Son by Himself enter into us. The Father is unapproachable (1 Tim. 6:16), but the Son came to tabernacle among us (John 1:14). But still He was not able to enter into us because He was blood and flesh. As a man with a physical body He was able to be among His disciples, but not within them. So He told His disciples that He had to die and to be raised up. By His death and resurrection His form was changed from a physical form into a spiritual form. He became the pneumatic Christ who was able to enter into His disciples (John 20:22). This is the reaching of the Triune God.</p>
<p>When the Triune God reaches His redeemed people, He is the Spirit. For example, with electricity there is both the power plant and the installation in your house. Just to have the power plant is not practical. It is only when the power is installed into your house that the electricity becomes practical in your daily life. You are a building and God is the source, the power plant, in the heavens. The Spirit, the reaching of the Triune God, has been installed into your being. When the Spirit enters into your being, He does not leave the Father and the Son far away in the heavens. That is a wrong concept. When the Spirit comes into you, He comes with both the Son and the Father. If you have the Spirit, you have the Son. If you have the Son, you also have the Father. You have all Three. In the Father you taste love, in the Son you enjoy grace, and in the Spirit you participate in the communion, the fellowship, the flow, of the divine life. Love is the source, grace is the enjoyment, and the Spirit is the communion (2 Cor. 13:14). This is the dispensing of the Triune God.</p>
<p>When I was young I taught people that to be a Christian is, first of all, to fear God. You must have a holy fear toward God. Second, you must love the Lord Jesus. Third, you must endeavor to improve yourself to be good&mdash;a good husband, a good wife, a good child, a good father, a good mother, a good neighbor, a good student, etc. But now I want to tell you that a Christian is one who lives a life of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is not one who lives a life of good behavior. A Christian is one who lives a life of the Triune God. Today the very reaching of this Triune God into you is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). When the Spirit comes, He comes in the Son&rsquo;s name, and He comes with the Son and with the Father. So when you have this reaching Spirit, you have the Son. And when the Son comes to you, He comes in the name of the Father, and He comes with the Father. When you have the Son, you have the Father. Now you have all Three living in you as one to be your life, your life supply, your everything. As a Christian you don&rsquo;t need to take care of good behavior. Forget about that! You have to thoroughly and absolutely take care of the Triune God within you. He is so real.</p>
<p>When you call &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t you have a deep sensation of comfort, of light, of happiness, of peace, of consolation, of so many pleasant feelings? If you were to call on Abraham Lincoln or George Washington, nothing happens. But when you call &ldquo;Lord Jesus! I love You!&rdquo; you have the deep sensation that He loves you also and that He is living in you. This is not a superstition; this is a fact. The Spirit is the reality of the Triune God. When this reaching Spirit is in you, the entire God is in you.</p>
<p>A bonafide Christian is simply one who lives a life of this reality, a life of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. To live a life of the Triune God simply means to be one with the Triune God. As He moves, you move. As He speaks, you speak. As He stays, you stay. It is not a matter of ethics or of trying to overcome sin and the world. You just need to take care of Him. You just live a life of the Triune God. If you live such a life, the world will be judged, the Devil will flee, and all sinful things will be overcome. The Triune God becomes your life, your living, your victory, your holiness, your righteousness, your love, your life, and your light. This is a bonafide Christian with the divine ethics, much higher than the human. You need to live a life of the Triune God. The Spirit is the entering in and the applier of the Triune God. Our God is not only the source and not only the expression, but also the entering in. He has entered into our being.</p><h2 class="head1">ANOTHER PARACLETE</h2>
<p>The Spirit is another Paraclete (John 14:16). Paraclete is the anglicized form of the Greek word <em>paracletos.</em> This is a very inclusive word. It means one who serves you, who is called to your side to help you in everything. It also denotes one who is taking care of your case like an attorney, or who intercedes for you like an intercessor. It also denotes a kind of patron. Further, it denotes consoling and comforting, which is why the King James Version renders it comforter.</p>
<p>The Spirit, the Third of the Trinity, is the total consummation of the Triune God. He is not just one third of the Godhead; He is the totality of the Godhead. Such a One is your helper, your patron, your counselor, your comforter who takes care of your needs in your daily life. The same word is used concerning the Lord Jesus in 1 John 2:1 where it is translated advocate. These are not two; these are one. As our advocate He is with the Father, and as our paraclete He is within us. We have such a One within us taking care of all our need. If you need a helper, He is such a helper. If you need an attorney, He is such an attorney. If you need someone to pray for you, He is such an intercessor. This is the Paraclete. The first part of the word, <em>para,</em> is a prefix which means alongside or along with you. Someone is alongside of you, along with you, all the time. He is like a nurse taking care of a sick person. He is like an attorney taking care of your case in the heavenly court. He is everything to you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVEN BY THE FATHER IN ANSWERING<br />
THE SON&rsquo;S REQUEST</h2>
<p>The Spirit is given by the Father in answering the Son&rsquo;s request (John 14:16). Even now I cannot fully understand this point. The Son requested the Father to give the Spirit. This one act involved the Three of the Godhead. The Second requested the First to give the Third. What is this? I don&rsquo;t know, but I do know the Three of the Godhead are working together to give us the Spirit, as revealed in John 14:16.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SENT BY THE FATHER IN THE SON&rsquo;S NAME</h2>
<p>The Spirit was sent by the Father in the Son&rsquo;s name (John 14:26). John 14:26 is not easy to interpret. Does it mean that the Father does something in the Son&rsquo;s name? Or does it mean that the Spirit is sent in the Son&rsquo;s name? Regardless of which way we interpret it, the result is the same. Whether the Father sent the Spirit in the Son&rsquo;s name, or whether the Father sent the Spirit and the Spirit came in the Son&rsquo;s name, the coming is the same. This indicates that the Three have never been separated. When One moves, the other Two are with the One. One is sent, and the other Two join the coming. When the Son comes, He comes in the Father&rsquo;s name, and He comes as the Father. When the Spirit is sent, He is sent in the Son&rsquo;s name. That means He is sent as the Son. So the Son comes as the Father, and the Spirit is sent as the Son. This simply means that the Three are one. You cannot separate them. The First sent the Second, and the Second comes in the name of the First as the First; then the Second sent the Third, and the Third comes in the name of the Second. This is marvelous! Among the Three there is a definite distinction, but there is no separation at all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROCEEDING FROM WITH THE FATHER</h2>
<p>The Spirit proceeds from with the Father (John 15:26). The Spirit does not come by Himself alone. He comes from the Father, and He comes with the Father. In other words, His coming brings the Father with Him. So when He comes, the Father comes also. The Two, He and the Father, are one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING ALL THAT IS OF THE SON,<br />
THUS BECOMING<br />
THE SON&rsquo;S TRANSFIGURATION</h2>
<p>The Spirit receives all that is of the Son (John 16:14-15). Whatever the Son is and has, has been disclosed, passed on, to the Spirit. The Spirit then discloses everything He has received to us. So actually He is the transfiguration of the Son. Whatever the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s, making the Son the very embodiment of the Father (Col. 2:9). Whatever the Son has, has been passed on to the Spirit, making the Spirit the transfiguration of the Son. So the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son.</p>
<p>Many Christians today would not use these two terms: embodiment and transfiguration. Instead they would use the word representative. They would say that the Holy Spirit within us is the representative of Christ who is in heaven. This word representative is a leaven; it leavens the truth. In the Triune God there is no representation, but there is the embodiment and the transfiguration. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is transfigured into the Spirit. There is no thought of representation. The Son does not represent the Father, nor does the Spirit represent the Son. No! The Son embodies the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. Representation would indicate that the Father is separate from the Son. This would also indicate that the Son is separate from the Spirit. This would indicate a separation between the Three, between the One who represents and the One who is represented. But embodiment indicates union, oneness, and identification. In principle transfiguration does the same thing.</p>
<p>Most of the truths in the Bible have been leavened. This is a subtlety of the enemy. He has leavened the truths, depriving them of their riches and weight. This is why we need the recovery. The Lord wants to recover all the leavened truths. Don&rsquo;t use the word representative, and don&rsquo;t bring in the thought of representation concerning the Triune God. We should use the words embodied and transfigured, or embodiment and transfiguration.</p><h2 class="head1">TO ABIDE WITH THE SON AND<br />
THE FATHER IN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The Spirit abides with the Son and the Father in the believers (John 14:17, 23; Rom. 8:9-11). In Romans 8:9-11 three divine titles are used interchangeably: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ. This indicates that Christ is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God. These three divine titles are used interchangeably to describe the dispensing of the Trinity into our three parts to mingle Himself fully with our being. The Trinity is mingled with our three parts. This is really wonderful! This is the abiding of the Triune God in His ultimate consummation, which is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Why must we spend so much time on this? It is because the leavened truth still remains in our concept. This leavening element is universally common among Christians. Christians have a subconscious understanding that the Three of the Trinity are divided and separated. They think that today they have only the Holy Spirit in them; they don&rsquo;t have the Father, and they don&rsquo;t have the Son. This is why in our study of the holy Word concerning the Trinity we have picked up point after point which give us a clear view that first, the Son comes in the Father&rsquo;s name, and the Spirit is sent in the Son&rsquo;s name and second, that the Son comes with the Father, and the Spirit comes with the Father and the Son. These two points prove that the Triune God is uniquely one. Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are distinct, they are one, inseparable, indivisible, and undivided. When you have one, you have all Three.</p>
<p>But the Father never comes first. The one who comes first is always the Spirit. When you have the Spirit, the Son is with you; when you have the Son, you also have the Father. First John 2:23 says, &ldquo;He who confesses the Son has the Father also.&rdquo; So when you have the Son, you have both the Son and the Father. Because the Son comes as the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), He is the pneumatic Christ.</p>
<p>This is what the New Testament calls eternal life (1 John 5:20). Eternal life is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, who come to us in the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. This Triune God is the reality of eternal life. When we Christians say that we should grow in life, we mean that we should grow with the element and essence of the Triune God. When we say life, we mean the Triune God. We don&rsquo;t mean something apart from the Triune God. Life in our Christian experience is just the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Life is the Triune God, and this life is within us. What a wonder! What a blessing! The Triune God is within us as our life.</p>
<p>Before the death and resurrection of Christ, the Spirit was not yet (John 7:39), because Christ had not completed the process which He had to go through. He had been incarnated, but He had not yet passed through death and entered into resurrection. One day He went into death, passed through death, and entered into resurrection, and then He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet. That means that the process for the Spirit of God to be the life-giving Spirit was not completed, because Jesus was not yet glorified, that is, He had not yet gone through death into resurrection. But after He went through death and entered into resurrection, He was glorified, and the process for the bringing forth of the life-giving Spirit was completed.</p>
<p>After His resurrection He disclosed the title of the Trinity clearly to the disciples. In Matthew 28:19, after His resurrection and in His resurrection, He came back to His disciples and charged them to disciple the nations and baptize the believing ones into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Not until He had passed through all the necessary processes was the Divine Trinity, as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, clearly revealed in the Scriptures. After and in His resurrection, man can be baptized into the fully processed Trinity that he may have an organic union with the dispensing Triune God. Now we, the believing and baptized people, are one with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We participate in the Triune God and enjoy His dispensing of Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO TESTIFY CONCERNING THE SON AND GLORIFY HIM</h2>
<p>The Spirit of the resurrected Christ comes to testify concerning the Son and to glorify Him (John 15:26; 16:14). As the transfiguration of the Son, He makes the Son real in the believers&rsquo; experience. This is to testify concerning the Son. Without the Spirit, the Son would be objective to the believers and could not be subjective to them in their experiences of Him.</p>
<p>When the Spirit discloses what the Son is to the believers and makes Him real to them in their life, the Son is glorified. By this the Son becomes the believers&rsquo; life within and their expression without. This is to glorify the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO OVERFLOW FROM WITHIN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Eventually, this Spirit will fill up the believers and overflow from within them as rivers of living water in many aspects of their Christian life (John 7:38-39). This is for the believers in Christ to experience and enjoy the Triune God to the uttermost. This is the ultimate consummation of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into God&rsquo;s chosen people.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE CONSUMMATION<br />
OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:2; Heb. 1:8; Acts 5:3-4; John 4:24; Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 19:7-9; 21:2, 9, 11, 18-21; 22:1-2, 14, 17</h1>
<p>In this message we come to the consummation of the divine dispensing. The writings of the Apostle John are the last books of the divine revelation. His Gospel, his Epistles, and his book of Revelation were written about A.D. 90. If we would get into his writings, we would surely realize that they are on the Triune God. In his Gospel we see the dispensing of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Son came in the name of the Father, and He did everything to work out the Father&rsquo;s will. He worked in the Father&rsquo;s name, and He worked with the Father. He also spoke the Father&rsquo;s word and sought the Father&rsquo;s glory. From these points it is clear that the Son does nothing by Himself nor is He for Himself. He lives and works altogether with the Father, and for the Father. This indicates that He is the embodiment of the Father.</p>
<p>After the death and resurrection of the Son, the Spirit came in the Son&rsquo;s name to testify concerning the Son and to glorify the Son. The Spirit is not for Himself; He is altogether for the Son. The Son is for the Father, and the Spirit is for the Son. They Three are really one. The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is transfigured into the Spirit. This is for God in His divine economy, the divine household management and administration, to dispense Himself into His redeemed people to make them one with Him. This is clearly revealed in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>The consummation of the divine dispensing is in John&rsquo;s last book, the book of Revelation, which is also the last book of the New Testament and even of the entire Bible. In Revelation we can see the consummation, the issue, of the divine dispensing. This consummation is not only the consummation of the divine dispensing, but also the consummation of God&rsquo;s entire plan and economy.</p>
<p>Between the Gospel of John and the book of Revelation are John&rsquo;s Epistles, which cover the fellowship of the divine life. This fellowship is nothing less than the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God. In the Gospel of John we can see how the Triune God has been dispensed into us. In the Epistles of John we enjoy the Triune God by the fellowship of the divine life, which is the real experience and enjoyment of the Triune God who has been dispensed into us in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>This dispensing will issue in the book of Revelation. The consummation of the divine dispensing in the book of Revelation is mainly in the first three chapters and the last two. In the first three chapters there are the seven churches signified by the seven lampstands. In the last two chapters there is the wife of the Lamb signified by the New Jerusalem. Both the lampstands in this age and the New Jerusalem in eternity are the marvelous issue and consummation of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>Dear saints, we all need a clear view to see what the Triune God is doing today. He is doing the divine dispensing, dispensing Himself into all of us day and night. You may say that you do not see such a dispensing, but God sees it. To you it may not seem so prevailing, powerful, or evident, but to God and His enemy Satan, it is very evident. This dispensing began when Jesus came to earth, and it has been going on for nearly twenty centuries. We like to see things that are evident on the surface, but God does not care so much for things which are superficially evident. He cares for the reality and its result. Today on this earth underneath so many currents, there is a real current. What is the current? It is the Triune God dispensing Himself into all of His redeemed ones. How foolish it is if we are busy doing other works and do not care for this current, the Triune God dispensing Himself into us!</p>
<p>You may say that you do not feel much of God&rsquo;s dispensing, or that you have only a little of God&rsquo;s dispensing. As long as you have a little, that is good. For example, with a large amount of sand, there may be only a few grains of gold. God&rsquo;s dispensing is like this: a little bit in you and a little bit in me, on and on. To Him there is no time element. With the Lord a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). To us this dispensing has been going on over nineteen hundred years, but to Him it is less than two days. Many Christians like to say that the Lord Jesus will come soon. Some in the past even predicted when the Lord would come. But His delay has disappointed those who predicted. Didn&rsquo;t the Lord Jesus say that He was coming quickly (Rev. 22:12)? Yes, He did. But to us it is two thousand years; to Him it is just two days. His coming may be delayed for quite a period of time because He wants His dispensing to be fully completed. This dispensing is still going on and on. One day it will have a consummation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT<br />
BEING THE ONE GOD</h2>
<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God. First Peter 1:2 tells us that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8 tells us that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4 tells us that the Spirit is God. If you read the Bible in a superficial way, you may believe that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate persons. But if you read even only the Gospel of John carefully, getting into the depth of the truth, you will see that the Son came in the Father&rsquo;s name, He worked out the Father&rsquo;s will, He worked the Father&rsquo;s work with the Father and in the Father&rsquo;s name, He spoke the Father&rsquo;s word, and He sought the Father&rsquo;s glory. If you touch the depth in the verses that cover these points, you will realize that the Son and the Father are one. You cannot separate them.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Spirit is not separate from the Son. From these two titles it seems They are two separate persons. But when you get into the depth of the details in the verses that cover this matter, you see that the Spirit comes in the name of the Son, He comes to testify concerning the Son, and He glorifies the Son. Furthermore, the Son has given everything He is and has to the Spirit. These points indicate that the Spirit and the Son are one. If the Spirit and the Son were not one, how could the Spirit come in the Son&rsquo;s name? How could He come to reveal the Son? How could He come to glorify the Son? How could the Son give everything to Him? Eventually you have to admit They are one. This realization that the Son and the Father are one and that the Spirit and the Son are also one is according to the clear revelation in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>All these matters added together show you a crucial point: these Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are the one God; They can never be separate. The Second comes in the name of the First and with the First, and the Third was sent by the First in the name of the Second and came with the First and the Second. And They all are coinherent, as the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son (John 14:10-11). They are mingled with one another. How could They be separated? The Three are one. The Third is the transfiguration of the Second, and the Second is the embodiment of the First. The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. Such expressions actually mean that They are one. If the Son were not one with the Father, how could He be the Father&rsquo;s embodiment? If the Spirit were not one with the Son, how could He be the Son&rsquo;s transfiguration?</p>
<p>This matter of the Trinity is very mysterious; we cannot explain it thoroughly. It forces us to pick up terminology such as embodiment and transfiguration. We don&rsquo;t like to use the word representation, because we do not believe there is any kind of representation between the Father and the Son and between the Son and the Spirit. We believe that the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son. They cannot be separated from one another; neither are They represented by one another.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENTIRE GOD BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;God&rdquo; here surely denotes the entire God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The entire God, not only the Spirit, but the Spirit and the Father and the Son, is Spirit. Hence, we cannot say that only the Spirit is Spirit and that the Father is not Spirit or that the Son is not Spirit. As the Three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are all Spirit, so They all are one. The Father is Spirit, the Son is Spirit, and the Spirit is Spirit. The entire God is Spirit. As the Spirit, all the divine Three are one.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN SPIRITS BEING<br />
THE SEVEN EYES OF THE SON</h2>
<p>In the Gospel of John it may seem that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate persons. But when you come to the book of Revelation, John mixes up the divine Three of the Godhead. Revelation 1:4 speaks of the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and 4:5 speaks of the seven Spirits of God. Revelation 5:6 says that the seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb. Of course, the Lamb is the Son, the Second of the Godhead. So in Revelation the Third of the Godhead is the eyes of the Second. Is this one person or two?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Revelation 21:23-24a says that the Lamb is the lamp. God the Son, the Second of the Trinity, is the lamp, and God the Father, the First of the Trinity, is the light, the glory, within the lamp. Are the lamp and the light two separate persons? Some teachers say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate persons. But John in his Revelation says that the Third is the eyes of the Second, and that the Second is the lamp with the First within as the light. These teachers separate the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as three persons. But the Bible, in the book of Revelation, reveals that the divine Three are inseparable and not separate. The Third is the eyes of the Second, and the Second is the lamp to contain the First as the light. Furthermore, this third One is also seven lamps. The second One is the unique lamp to contain the First as the light, and the third One is the seven lamps to express the Second. The seven lamps are the seven eyes of the Second of the Trinity, who is the unique lamp. This is the way the last book of the Bible talks about the Trinity.</p>
<p>What does it mean that the Third is the seven lamps as the seven eyes of the Second, who is the unique lamp to contain the First? It means the Third expresses the Second and the Second expresses the First. We express ourselves very much by our eyes. Whether we like someone or not can be seen by the expression in the eyes. So the seven eyes of the Second mean the expression of the Second. The Third is the eyes of the Second, the Second is the lamp, the expression, of the First, and the Third is also the seven lamps, the expression, of the Second. The First is contained and expressed in the Second, and the Second is expressed in the Third.</p>
<p>Revelation continues the Gospel of John to show us that in the Divine Trinity the Third is the eyes of the Second and the Second is the lamp to contain the First as the light. Furthermore, the Third is the seven lamps to express the Second, and the Second is the unique lamp to express the First. The First is expressed through the Second, and the Second is expressed through the Third in a sevenfold way. So the Three are one, not three separate persons. This is for the consummation of the divine dispensation.</p>
<p>Today both the Catholic Church and some of the Protestant denominations appreciate the Nicene Creed. They say this is the base of their faith. But at the time the Nicene Council was held in A.D. 325, seven books of the New Testament, including Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation, were not recognized as books of the Holy Scripture. The Nicene Creed says nothing about the seven Spirits of God, so it is not complete. These seven books, including the book of Revelation, were recognized seventy-two years later, in A.D. 397 in the Council of Carthage in North Africa. So we cannot accept the Nicene Creed as a complete revelation of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE CONSUMMATION<br />
OF THE TRIUNE GOD, REACHING HIS REDEEMED</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, reaching His redeemed people and expressed in the lampstands, which signify the churches in this age (Rev. 1:11-12, 20; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). The lampstand itself is the embodiment of the Divine Trinity dispensed into the members of Christ. What is the church? It is the expression of the Divine Trinity dispensed into God&rsquo;s children. The definition of the church in Revelation is very high and deep. The church is not just a group of Christians, nor is it simply an organization of Christian believers, but it is the blending of the Divine Trinity who has been dispensed into all the believers.</p>
<p>In the lampstand you can see the Father, you can see the Son, and you can see the Spirit. The substance of the lampstand is gold. Gold in typology signifies the nature of God the Father. With the lampstand there is also a certain form. The lampstand is not just a piece of gold without a proper shape; it is a piece of gold shaped into a certain form. This means the gold is embodied into a shape, and the shape is God the Son. The substance is the Father, and the form is the Son. Furthermore, the lampstand has seven lamps for expression. The seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God (Rev. 4:5). So the substance is God the Father, the shape and form is God the Son, and the expression is God the Spirit. Such a lampstand is the church. This is not religion, nor is it any kind of &ldquo;-anity.&rdquo; This is not a matter of ethics or morality or natural thought or philosophy.</p>
<p>The church is the embodiment of the Triune God dispensed into us and blended within us. It is the Triune God dispensed into humanity and blended in humanity as one single entity (Rev. 22:17a). There is no separation. This is the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God, reaching His redeemed, and this is the consummation of the divine dispensing in this age.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING ONE WITH THE BRIDE&mdash;<br />
THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEEMED</h2>
<p>Eventually this consummation will come to the ultimate stage, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a single entity which is considered the wife of the Lamb, the bride (Rev. 22:17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Universal Marriage</h2>
<p>The consummation of the divine dispensing will be a universal marriage (Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9). The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God dispensed into His redeemed people will be there as the Bridegroom; and God&rsquo;s redeemed people as the consummation of the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed humanity will be there as the bride. We know this because Revelation 22:17 reads, &ldquo;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!&rdquo; In this verse the Spirit and the bride together as a couple say &ldquo;come.&rdquo; The husband is the Spirit, and the wife is the bride.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mingling of the Trinity with His Redeemed</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a composition of the Divine Trinity with God&rsquo;s redeemed people. First of all it is composed of God the Father&rsquo;s nature, signified by the gold. The city and its street are made of pure gold (21:18, 21b), denoting God the Father in His nature. The twelve gates of the New Jerusalem, which are twelve pearls (21:21a), signify God the Son&rsquo;s overcoming death and His life-imparting resurrection. An oyster is a small animal which lives in the death waters. It has a life which overcomes the death waters, and by secreting a life element, it produces pearls. Christ&rsquo;s overcoming death plus His life-imparting resurrection secretes the &ldquo;juice&rdquo; of the divine life to form us into pearls. So in the pearl we can see the Son in His death and resurrection. The pearl signifies God&rsquo;s redeemed and regenerated people. According to John 3, regeneration is the entry into the kingdom. You cannot enter into the kingdom of God unless you are born of the Spirit (John 3:5). Regeneration is the entry, the gate, into the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The precious stones signify the transforming work of God the Spirit (Rev. 21:11, 18-20). After regeneration, the Spirit continues to transform the regenerated people of God to make every one of them a precious stone. By this you can see that the New Jerusalem is a composition of the Father as the substance, of the Son as the entry, and of the Spirit as the transformation. It is a building of the Trinity with redeemed, regenerated, and transformed humanity.</p>
<p>The entire New Jerusalem is saturated with God the Spirit as the river of living water which flows out of the throne of God the Father and of the Lamb, God the Son. In the river the tree of life grows (Rev. 22:1-2). The life water, God the Spirit, quenches thirst, and the life tree, God the Son, nourishes. The entire city, which is a composition of the Trinity with His redeemed people, is watered, nourished, and saturated with the divine life, which is nothing less than the Triune God (Rev. 22:1-2, 14, 17), dispensing Himself to saturate His redeemed people. What a picture this is! This is a blending of the Triune God with His redeemed people. The nature of the Father is the substance. The redemption of the Son, including His death and resurrection, is the entry. And the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation is the work to make us divine and precious. Such a composition is the New Jerusalem. It is saturated by the eternal life, which is the Triune God Himself. This is the consummation of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>I look to the Lord that through these messages you may see a vision of God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s goal, and what God is doing to reach His goal. What God is doing is dispensing Himself as the Father, the source, as the Son, the expression, and as the Spirit, the very entering in, into you and me. Day and night He is working on this one thing. He is working toward this one goal, that we all would be a lampstand in this age to express the Triune God, and eventually that we would be that bride in eternity, a composition of redeemed and regenerated humanity saturated with the Triune God as life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Express God Fully for Eternity</h2>
<p>Such a composition of the Triune God with His redeemed people will express God fully for eternity (Rev. 21:11a). So at the end of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Now we can see why John says that the Son comes in the Father&rsquo;s name, and the Spirit comes in the Son&rsquo;s name. In his Gospel John prepares the way to show us that these three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are not separate. These Three actually are one. The source, the expression, and the entering in become the consummation. The Spirit is not separated from the Son nor from the Father. The Spirit is the consummation of the entire Triune God. The Spirit as the Bridegroom is the totality and consummation of the Triune God. He is qualified to be such a husband to marry the wife, who is the consummation of all the redeemed and regenerated people of God. This is a universal couple with divinity marrying humanity.</p>
<p>Here are two consummations. Divinity has gone through a process&mdash;through incarnation, through crucifixion, through resurrection, and through ascension&mdash;to become the Spirit, the totality, the consummation, of the Triune God to be the Bridegroom. Humanity also has gone through a process&mdash;through redemption, through regeneration, and through transformation&mdash;to become the consummation of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. The consummation of the Triune God and the consummation of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people become one in a universal marriage. The processed man will match the processed God forever for His full expression and satisfaction.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE CHURCH&mdash;THE BODY OF CHRIST,<br />
THE FULLNESS OF THE ONE<br />
WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:1-23</h1>
<p>The crucial focus of the book of Ephesians is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into all the believers. In other messages we have pointed out that this book is structured with the Trinity. For example, a meeting hall may be structured mainly with steel, wood, and stone. In like manner, the entire book of Ephesians is structured with the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Now let us come to Ephesians chapter one. As the title of this message indicates, the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Ephesians issues in the church. This means that the divine dispensing produces the church. Without the dispensing the church cannot be produced. Chapter one tells us that the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, is the issue of God&rsquo;s dispensing Himself into His believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE DIVINE GRACE AND PEACE</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:2 says, &ldquo;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Most Christians, including myself, have simply read this verse and taken for granted that they understand it. Although I had read this verse for many years, I did not realize what grace and peace are. Now I see that grace in the New Testament is nothing less than God dispensed into our being for our enjoyment (John 1:14, 17; Rom. 5:17, 21; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 12:9; 13:14; Gal. 6:18; 1 Pet. 4:10; 5:10). Grace is a Person, the very God Himself, dispensed into our spirit to be our life and life supply so that we may enjoy Him. If you read the New Testament with this understanding, the word grace will be much more meaningful. Grace denotes God as our enjoyment.</p>
<p>What is peace? Peace surely does not refer simply to a calm situation in our environment. Peace is not something outward, but something inward. Peace within us is the result of the enjoyment of grace. When we enjoy God as grace, the result is peace. Peace is the issue, the result, the fruit, of our enjoyment of the very God within us, the One who has been dispensed into us.</p>
<p>According to my experience, such a peace implies five matters. First, it implies rest. If you do not have rest, you cannot have peace. Peace also implies comfort, enjoyment, satisfaction, and joy. When I enjoy God as my inward portion, I have rest, comfort, enjoyment, satisfaction, and joy. This is peace. Outwardly I may have problems, yet inwardly I have the enjoyment of God, and I am a happy person. This is peace as the issue of the enjoyment of God as our grace. This enjoyment of the divine grace and peace is to the saints and the faithful in Christ Jesus, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (vv. 1-2).</p>
<h2 class="head1">BY THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<p>How can we have the enjoyment of God that results in peace? We can have this by the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. If you read chapter one of Ephesians again with this kind of understanding, it will be a new chapter to you.</p>
<p>We all need to have our mind renewed when we come to the Bible. This means we need to drop our understanding from the past. The old understanding which we have picked up in the past has become a thick veil upon our eyes. I hope that all the layers of the veils will be taken away from our eyes. Then we shall be able to take the Bible purely as it is and see the pure Word. The pure Word indicates that grace and peace may be to us by the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>The first item is the Father&rsquo;s dispensing. The Father, our God, is wonderful. He is one unique God, yet He is triune. He is one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. I cannot tell you how this can be, nor can I explain it. Martin Luther said that if we fully understood the Trinity, we must be God. Only God knows this. It is too mysterious. We cannot understand how the one unique God can be triune. Even the more, no one can explain it. Through nearly twenty centuries of Christian history, teachers and theologians have tried to explain the Trinity. But in doing so they have made mistakes and caused problems. We have learned a lesson from them and received a warning, so that we do not like to explain too much. We prefer to speak according to what the pure Word reveals.</p><h2 class="head2">The Father&rsquo;s Selection and Predestination&mdash;<br />
God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>For the dispensing of the Divine Trinity the Father first selected us. We were selected not only before we were born, but even before the foundation of the world (v. 4). In eternity, before time began, God the Father selected us. Then He predestinated us, determining a destiny for us (v. 5). He determined this destiny beforehand; hence, it is a predestination. Following His selection, God predestinated us unto sonship (v. 5). This means He destined beforehand that we may be His sons.</p>
<p>Sonship is a matter of life-dispensing. If a father has many sons, this means he has dispensed much life. God created only one man, Adam, as the forefather of the human race. But Adam&rsquo;s descendants number in the billions. This is the result of life-dispensing. As human beings, we are here by life-dispensing. Likewise, as members of Christ, we are here by God&rsquo;s life-dispensing.</p>
<p>Some may say that the term &ldquo;life-dispensing&rdquo; is not found in the Bible. That is correct. The word Trinity also is not in the Bible. Nevertheless, in the Bible there is the fact of the Trinity. In order to speak of the fact, we need terminology. Therefore, the word Trinity was coined to denote the Triune Godhead of the unique God. Likewise, when we read the Bible and see that God has predestined us before the foundation of the world unto sonship, we need a proper definition of sonship. We have seen that sonship involves life-dispensing. We have a great Father who is rich in life. His capacity is universally great, and He has much life to dispense. No one can tell how many millions of sons God has begotten. In all this begetting He has dispensed His life into His sons. We have a great Father who has dispensed much life.</p>
<p>Now you can understand why I say that Ephesians 1 has the divine dispensing. It has the dispensing because it has the sonship. Sonship is a great matter. Our destiny is sonship. Praise the Lord that we have been predestined unto sonship! Our predestination unto sonship is through Jesus Christ and according to the good pleasure of His will (v. 5).</p>
<p>Sonship results in &ldquo;the praise of the glory of His grace&rdquo; (v. 6). God&rsquo;s grace has a glory, and glory means expression. For example, when electricity is hidden, there is no light. When the electricity shines, it is expressed, and this shining is the glory of electricity. Likewise, God&rsquo;s grace has a glory, and this glory is the sonship. Do you realize that the entire globe is full of the divine sonship, with the many sons of God?</p>
<p>Recently I bought two maps for my living room, and I put pins in every place where there is a church. What a glorious sight! What are the churches? They are the totality, the aggregate, of all the sons of God. This is the sonship, and the sonship is the glory. Therefore, the sonship is to the praise of the glory of God&rsquo;s grace. This is the glory of the sonship.</p>
<p>At one time we all were sinners and were scattered. But now we have been gathered together through the life-dispensing. Our Father has begotten us, dispensing His life into all of us. Now we all have the divine life dispensed into us by our one Father. This dispensed divine life is the factor that unites us. We all are in the sonship, and this is a glory to His grace. This is the dispensing of the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Son&rsquo;s Redemption&mdash;the Accomplishment<br />
of God&rsquo;s Eternal Purpose</h2>
<p>The Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination are for God&rsquo;s purpose. Now we come to the Son&rsquo;s redemption, which is for the accomplishment of the Father&rsquo;s purpose. According to traditional theology, the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit, as three distinct and separate persons. If this were the case, when the Son came, the Father would have remained in heaven. But by reading the Gospel of John carefully, we can see that when the Son came, He came with the Father (John 8:29; 16:32). The Son came not in His own name, but in the Father&rsquo;s name (John 5:43), and in Isaiah 9:6 is even called the everlasting Father. The Son did the Father&rsquo;s work (John 5:17, 19), He did the Father&rsquo;s will (John 5:30; 6:38), He spoke the Father&rsquo;s word (John 3:34a; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50), He sought the Father&rsquo;s glory (John 7:18), and He expressed the Father (John 14:7-9). From these verses we can see that nothing was of the Son; everything was of the Father. This means that when the Son came, the Father came. The Son and the Father are one (John 10:30; 17:22). The Son was in the Father, and the Father was in Him (John 14:10-11; 17:21). When the Son spoke, the Father worked. The Son accomplished redemption through His blood and according to the riches of God&rsquo;s grace (Eph. 1:7-9a).</p>
<p>The Son&rsquo;s redemption for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is &ldquo;unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 1:9b-10). What does it mean for all things to be headed up in the Son? We may use the human body as an illustration. As long as we are alive, all of our members, including our feet, legs, and hands, are headed up. But if we die, the members will become detached. This indicates that the heading up depends on the uniting of life. The life in our body is the means by which all the members are headed up. When the life goes, there is no longer any heading up.</p>
<p>After God created Adam, He put him before the tree of life. But Adam partook of the other tree, the tree of death (Gen. 3:6). At that time death came into man. Because man was the representative of the whole creation, his death caused all of creation to lose the heading up and become scattered.</p>
<p>Through the Son&rsquo;s redemption, the divine life has been dispensed into His believers. This life that has been dispensed into them unites all of them. Christ as the Head with this uniting life thus heads up all the believers. This heading up is the church life. However, because many believers still live in the old creation, they are detached. They have no oneness, no uniting, which means they have no heading up. We must learn how to live by the divine life. As long as we live by this divine life, we are united. This uniting life is used by Christ the Head to head us up into one church life. This heading up of the church will spread until the time of the new heaven and the new earth. At that time there will be the New Jerusalem, which will be the center of God&rsquo;s ultimate heading up. Then there will be the dispensation of the fullness of time. Dispensation here means arrangement or management. In eternity all things in heaven and on earth will be headed up in Christ through the church.</p>
<p>Many Christians today are not headed up because they are short of the dispensing of the divine life. This is the reason it is our burden today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery not to teach mere doctrines, but to dispense the divine life. Through this life-dispensing, saints from many countries around the globe become one. What has brought about this oneness? It is the life-dispensing. Life-dispensing heads us up. This is the result of Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Christ&rsquo;s redemption takes away our sin so that death may be swallowed and that all the members may be headed up through the life-dispensing.</p>
<p>In Christ we also were made an inheritance (Eph. 1:11). Furthermore, the Son&rsquo;s redemption for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is unto the praise of God&rsquo;s glory (v. 12). After the Father&rsquo;s dispensing in verse 6, Paul says, &ldquo;To the praise of the glory of His grace.&rdquo; Then after the Son&rsquo;s dispensing, Paul says, &ldquo;To the praise of His glory.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">The Spirit&rsquo;s Sealing and Pledging&mdash;<br />
The Application of God&rsquo;s Accomplished Purpose</h2>
<p>The Spirit&rsquo;s dispensing is His sealing &ldquo;unto the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of His glory&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). The seal of the Holy Spirit is living, and it works within us to permeate and transform us with God&rsquo;s element until we are matured in God&rsquo;s life and eventually fully redeemed even in our body.</p>
<p>God seals us with the Spirit. We may illustrate this sealing with a rubber stamp and a piece of blank paper. By stamping the blank piece of paper, we dispense the ink onto the paper. If we stamp the paper again and again, eventually it will be saturated and soaked with the ink.</p>
<p>Not only is sonship a matter of life-dispensing, but the sealing of the Spirit also involves life-dispensing. Day after day, the Spirit is sealing us. When you were a sinner, you were like an unclean sheet of paper. But one day you repented to God and called on the Lord&rsquo;s name. His blood washed you, cleansed you, and made you like a piece of clean blank paper. At that time the Spirit sealed you.</p>
<p>We need to know who the Spirit is who sealed us. When the Son came, He came with the Father, and when the Spirit came, He came with the Son and the Father. Therefore, the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. The Spirit is actually the application of the Son and the Father to us. The rubber stamp is the application of the ink to the paper. When you put the stamp on the paper, the ink is added to the paper. The Spirit is the consummation and the reaching of the Triune God to us. When He seals us, the entire Triune God reaches us. The Spirit not only reaches us; He is also attached to us (2 Cor. 1:21). The reaching is His attaching, and the attaching is also His dispensing. The Triune God has been dispensed into us. He has reached us, and He has been attached to us. The divine sealing, the life-dispensing of the Triune God, is taking place within us all the time.</p>
<p>The sealing of the Spirit is unto the redemption of the acquired possession (1:13b, 14b). Some versions say &ldquo;until&rdquo;, but &ldquo;unto&rdquo; is more meaningful because it means resulting in. We were acquired by God as His possession. From the day He acquired us, He began the sealing in order to saturate us with the Triune God. It is too objective simply to say that we have God&rsquo;s seal upon us as a mark. We not only have a seal but also have a sealing to saturate our entire being with God&rsquo;s element. Our body has not yet been redeemed; it still is a natural being. But we have a sealing, the saturating, of the Holy Spirit, within us, and this sealing will continue until the day our body is fully saturated. That will be the redemption of our body, the redemption of God&rsquo;s acquired possession. Now, as God&rsquo;s acquired possession, we are still under the sealing.</p>
<p>The Spirit is also a pledge, a foretaste, of our divine inheritance, guaranteeing the full taste of God as our eternal inheritance (v. 14a). This word &ldquo;pledge&rdquo; is very meaningful. It means earnest, security, guarantee, and also foretaste. According to an ancient practice, when someone bought a piece of land, the seller would give him a bag of soil as a sample for a pledge. That soil was a guarantee that the purchaser would get the land with the same soil. This is an illustration of the fact that the sealing Spirit, after sealing us, remains within us to be our foretaste of God as our inheritance.</p>
<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, two things happened. First, we became God&rsquo;s inheritance, God&rsquo;s possession, with His seal upon us. God sealed us with the Spirit as a sign that we belong to Him as His possession. At the same time God became our possession. He became our portion and enjoyment. The sealing Spirit is a sign that we are His possession, and the sealing Spirit also becomes a pledge, a foretaste, of the very God who is our inheritance. This foretaste is a guarantee, security, that one day we shall enjoy the full taste.</p>
<p>Both the sealing and the pledging are life-dispensing. Every day the Spirit is sealing us and pledging Himself into our being as our foretaste. This foretaste of the pledging is a guarantee of the full taste. The Triune God is sealing us and pledging Himself into our being. This is the dispensing of the Spirit.</p>
<p>At the end of verse 14 we have once again the phrase, &ldquo;To the praise of His glory.&rdquo; This phrase is used three times: first, for the Father&rsquo;s dispensing in verse 6; second, for the Son&rsquo;s dispensing in verse 12; and third, for the Spirit&rsquo;s dispensing in verse 14. This threefold mentioning of the praise of God&rsquo;s glory signifies the threefold dispensing of the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>The issue of the threefold dispensing of the Triune God is through our spirit of revelation (v. 17) and by the exceeding greatness of His power toward us (v. 19). This great power is according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead (v. 20), that is, in resurrection; in seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies far above all (vv. 20b-21), that is, in ascension; in subjecting all things under His feet (v. 22a), that is, making Him above everything; and in giving Him to be Head over all things to the church (v. 22b). Such a power has been applied to us, and the application of this power is the life-dispensing. It is by the life-dispensing of the Triune God that such a power, even a power of surpassing greatness, has been applied to all of us.</p>
<p>The result, or issue, of this dispensing is the church, the Body of Christ. How can sinners become the Body of Christ? This is only by the divine life-dispensing. When the Triune God dispenses Himself into us, this life-dispensing saturates our entire being and causes us to become regenerated, transformed, and even transparent members of Christ. Therefore, we are now the Body of Christ, which is an organism, not an organization. We may say that a chair is organized of many pieces of wood. In contrast, a man is an organism because he is organic. When the Triune God dispenses Himself into our being, this life-dispensing makes us organic. Together all of us are an organism, and this organism is the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is not a social organization. It is something organic, an entity saturated by the life-dispensing of the Triune God. The so-called churches are for the most part organizations instead of an organism. The church must be an organism that is fully organic. The church must be full of life-dispensing, saturated with the Triune God in every part. This is the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is the fullness of the universal Christ. The fullness of a person is his body. If a person had only a head and no body, he would not have any fullness. But with a body, there is the fullness. The Body of Christ, which is the church, is the fullness of this great, universal Christ who fills all in all (v. 23). How can this be? It can be only by the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Thus Ephesians 1 reveals the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</p>
<p>The Body comes into being not by organizing, but only by life-dispensing. It comes into being only by the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;dispensing Himself as life and life supply into all His believers, saturating them and thereby making them the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE HOLY TEMPLE IN THE LORD&mdash;<br />
THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:1-22</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we saw the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Ephesians chapter one. Ephesians 1 reveals that God selected us and predestinated us with a view to dispense Himself into us as life and life supply by sonship, that is, by life-dispensing, and by the sealing of the Spirit. Sealing of the Spirit indicates not only dispensing, but also saturating. God wants to saturate us with His life-dispensing so that we may be an organism, the Body of Christ, as the enlargement, the fullness, of the One who fills all in all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ORIGINAL CONDITION</h2>
<p>Chapter two of Ephesians tells us that the chosen ones of God became fallen. Before God began to dispense Himself into His chosen ones, we became fallen not only into sin, but also into death (v. 1). Within the realm of death in offenses and sins we walked first according to the age of this world, that is, according to the current, the tide, of the world (v. 2). It is not difficult to understand what is the current, the tide, of the age. The age of the world simply means the modern style of the world. As fallen people in the sphere of death we walked according to the trend of this age. Second, we walked according to the spirit who operates in the sons of disobedience (v. 2). This is not just one demon, nor one fallen angel, but an aggregate of the evil spiritual power. This is the spirit in the air who operates within unbelievers. Such an aggregate of the evil spiritual power is both above them and within them. Therefore, unbelievers walk in death according to the age of the world and according to the spiritual power in the air and within them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, fallen people have the lusts of the flesh, which cooperate with the world and with the spirit in the air (2:3a). This is the condition of fallen mankind.</p>
<p>Before God began to infuse Himself into man, man became fallen and became the flesh, walking according to the age of the world and according to Satan, the power in the air and the evil one operating in fallen mankind by the lusts of the flesh.</p>
<p>Because we were dead in offenses and sins, because we walked according to the age of this world and according to the ruler of the authority of the air, and because we behaved ourselves in the lusts of the flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts, we were by nature the children of wrath (2:3b).</p>
<p>Because the descendants of Adam had become fallen, God came in to call out Abraham with all his descendants to form the commonwealth of Israel (Gen. 12). In God&rsquo;s creation mankind had certain rights, but these were lost by man&rsquo;s fall. Therefore, God called out a people, Israel, and gave them rights as a commonwealth. A commonwealth denotes a people with certain civil rights. When God called out Israel, He recovered the lost rights and made Israel a commonwealth with the proper rights to enjoy God&rsquo;s blessing. For that commonwealth God gave them certain promises: that God would rule over them, that God would bless them, and that God would be their enjoyment. These promises were put into a legal form and became a covenant to the people of Israel. Thus, the entire Old Testament was a covenant with promises that had been put into a legal form. Such a commonwealth excluded the Gentiles.</p>
<p>When God called Israel to be His commonwealth to receive all the promises and to enjoy all the rights, He told them to circumcise themselves (Gen. 17:10-14). Because the people God called out were part of the fallen human race, walking in the flesh according to the age of the world, according to the spiritual evil power in the air and within them, and walking by the lusts of their flesh, they had to cut off their flesh. This cutting off of the flesh was signified by circumcision. Circumcision then became an ordinance that separated the Jews from the Gentiles. The Jews were called the circumcision, and the Gentiles were called the uncircumcision. The circumcision, or the circumcised people, were accepted by God to enjoy the rights of the commonwealth of God&rsquo;s people and to receive all the blessings. But the uncircumcised Gentiles were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenant. Hence, they were without God in the world and had no hope (Eph. 2:12).</p>
<p>Up to this point Christ was altogether related to the commonwealth of Israel. God was the God of the commonwealth of Israel, and all the blessings were within God&rsquo;s covenant. As long as you were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, you were alienated from God&rsquo;s commonwealth, from Christ, from God&rsquo;s covenant, from God&rsquo;s blessing, from any hope, and even from God Himself. You were in the world, not in the commonwealth of Israel. This is the condition of fallen mankind, and this was our condition before we were saved.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Father&rsquo;s Rich Mercy and Great Love</h2>
<p>Because God loved His chosen people with a noble, high, and great love, He would not give them up. Within His love there are the riches of His mercy. Love may maintain a high standard, but there is no need of any standard for mercy. Mercy can reach you in any situation. Love does not reach as far as mercy does. You do not love a pitiful person; you love a person who matches you. But within your love there may be mercy that reaches farther to people&rsquo;s pitiful condition to bring love to them.</p>
<p>God, in His great love, came to make us alive (2:5). Have you noticed that Ephesians 2 is different from the first section of Romans? In the first section of Romans it was sin and sins which were taken care of in order that we could be justified. But death is taken care of in Ephesians 2. According to Ephesians 2 we were not merely sinners&mdash;we were dead people. Dead people need more than justification; they need to be enlivened. Therefore, in His great love, God first enlivened us. When He resurrected Christ from the dead, He enlivened us. He did not enliven you at one time and me at another time. He enlivened us all at the same time in the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>In the Greek language the predicate used in 2:5 for enlivened or made alive has the prefix <em>sun.</em> This prefix means together, with, or co. God enlivened us together. This includes the apostles and all of us, even the last one to be saved in this age. All of us were enlivened together. Just as the children of Israel passed through the Red Sea together, so God enlivened all of us together. God also raised us up from among the dead (v. 6). Furthermore, He exalted us and seated us in the heavenlies (v. 6). This is the salvation revealed in Ephesians 2.</p>
<p>This salvation is not a salvation merely of forgiveness of sins or hope of going to heaven. We do not need to wait for a future day to go to heaven. We have already been seated in the heavenlies. This is neither a salvation merely of justification or reconciliation. This is a salvation of being enlivened, being raised up from the dead, and being seated in the heavens. This is to be saved by grace.</p>
<p>What a wonderful threefold salvation we have! In our salvation God has made us alive, He has raised us up together, and He has seated us with Christ in the heavenlies. This is the salvation revealed in Ephesians, salvation by life-dispensing.</p>
<p>A dead person can be made alive only by the dispensing of life into him. Forgiveness alone cannot make a dead person alive. Neither can washing cause a dead person to be enlivened. A person who is dead needs life-dispensing. Once life is dispensed into a dead person, he can jump up. He may still be dirty, but he can stand and walk. It is life-dispensing that enlivens him and raises him from among the dead.</p>
<p>To be saved by grace is much higher than to receive forgiveness of sins or justification or reconciliation. It is salvation that imparts life to us to make us alive, that raises us up from the dead, and that exalts us to the heavens and seats us there.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that Ephesians 2:10 indicates that such a salvation produces God&rsquo;s masterpiece. Verse 10 says that we are God&rsquo;s workmanship. The Greek word for workmanship may also be translated masterpiece. The Greek word here is <em>poiema,</em> a word that has been anglicized into the English word poem. We are God&rsquo;s poem. A poem often displays the wisdom of the writer. It expresses his skill, art, and design. We are poems written by the threefold life-dispensing of the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow. This threefold life-dispensing makes us a poem. We are the masterpiece of our Triune God by His threefold life-dispensing.</p><h2 class="head2">The Son&rsquo;s Accomplishment</h2>
<p>We were fallen into sin and into death and even were walking in the realm of sin and death, but God came to enliven us, to raise us up from the dead, and to exalt us and seat us in the heavens. But God did not do this directly. Have you noticed that thus far in Ephesians 2 the Father is not mentioned? The verses only mention God. God made us alive together with Christ. Without Christ there is no way for God to enliven us. He raised us up with Christ, and He seated us in the heavens with Christ. Christ is the means, the element, the sphere, for God to enliven us, to raise us up, and to seat us in the heavens. Outside of Christ God has no way to work out these three matters. God did it, but He did it through a channel, through Christ.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s channel, Christ did many things, but all He did can be summed up in the matter of His blood (2:13). The blood is the sign of Christ&rsquo;s marvelous death. The redemption through His blood has made us near to God and to all His blessings (v. 13). At one time we were far off from God, from God&rsquo;s commonwealth, Israel, from God&rsquo;s covenant, from Christ, from all the blessings. We were kept far off by our fall into sin and death. We could be made near only through Christ&rsquo;s blood that signifies Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive death. By His death on the cross He took away our sin and our sins.</p>
<p>Furthermore, through His death Christ made peace by breaking down the middle wall of partition, abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances, and creating the two in Himself into one new man (vv. 14-15). To say that He abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances does not mean that He abolished the Ten Commandments. Here the law of commandments refers to the law of the ritual commandments, not to the laws of morality, such as those dealing with the honoring of parents, or forbidding murder and adultery. These laws have never been abolished. Likewise, the laws prohibiting idolatry have not been abolished. The ethical, moral laws have never been abolished. But the ritual ordinances such as those related to food, holy days, and circumcision have been abolished. The rituals and commandments in ordinances eventually became a high wall separating the Jews and the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Not many Christians realize that when Christ died on the cross, He nailed all these ordinances to the cross. By His death on the cross Christ not only crucified our old man, our flesh, and destroyed Satan, the power of death; He also crucified all the ordinances, including circumcision, Sabbath-keeping, and ordinances concerning eating. He abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, the middle wall that separated the Jews from the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross released His divine life that was confined within Him, even as the life of a seed is confined within its shell. His crucifixion on the cross broke the shell and released the life confined within Him to produce the church.</p>
<p>By His all-inclusive and wonderful death, Christ created both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into one new man (2:15). This one new man is not an organization, but is an organism full of life. Today we have a number of Jewish saints in the churches. But because Christ has abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, and because we all have the dispensing of the divine life, we are one. We all have had the divine life dispensed into us. The dispensing of life not only changes us&mdash;it transforms us. The church is the issue of the divine dispensing of life. We are being transformed by God&rsquo;s dispensing. We all must be transformed persons, not reeducated persons. We must be transformed by the divine dispensing of the divine life of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>On the cross Christ did a marvelous job. His death was all-inclusive. Through the cross He took away sin and sins, He destroyed Satan, He judged the world, and He abolished all the ritual laws contained in the ordinances. Finally, He released His divine life into God&rsquo;s chosen people and created them into one new man as an organism constituted of the divine element by the dispensing of the divine life. Now both Jews and Gentiles are reconciled in one Body to God through the cross (v. 16).</p>
<p>After Christ accomplished all this by His all-inclusive death, He came to preach the gospel (2:17). How could He preach the gospel to us after He was crucified and buried? The answer is that He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit to indwell us (1 Cor. 15:45b). We need to realize that when we preach the gospel to others, Jesus also is preaching. After He died and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to be within us to preach the highest gospel, the gospel of the new man, the gospel of life-dispensing to make peace.</p><h2 class="head2">The Spirit&rsquo;s Access</h2>
<p>When Christ preaches such a gospel by Himself as the life-giving Spirit, and when we hear and accept such a gospel, what do we receive? The main thing we receive is the life-giving Spirit. Most Christians do not realize this. Do not think when we receive the gospel we mainly receive forgiveness of sins or justification. The main thing we receive by accepting such a gospel is the Spirit. Suppose an unbeliever says, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, thank You. You are my Savior, and I accept You. Lord, come into my heart.&rdquo; Immediately, Christ the Preacher, as the Spirit, will enter into that one, and he will receive the Spirit. Therefore, verse 18 speaks concerning the Spirit: &ldquo;For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo; Now we have the Spirit and are in the Spirit, and the Spirit brings us to the Father, the source.</p>
<p>Chapter two of Ephesians tells us that God loved us, enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies to make us His poem, His masterpiece. The God who did this is the Father as the source, acting through a channel, Christ the Son. In the foregoing message we pointed out that when the Son came; He came in the Father&rsquo;s name (John 5:43); He came with the Father (John 8:29; 16:32); the Son was even called the Father (Isa. 9:6). The Father is the source who planned all things, and the Son is the means, the course, who accomplished the Father&rsquo;s purpose. Christ became the channel in which and the means by which God enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2 reveals God as the Father and Christ as the Son. After His death and resurrection, Christ the Son came as the Spirit to preach the gospel. When the Spirit came, He came with the Father (John 15:26 and note 26<sup>1</sup>) in the Son&rsquo;s name (John 14:26). That means when the Spirit came, the Son came. Therefore, when the Son comes to preach the gospel to us, the Spirit also comes. When we receive the Son in His preaching, we receive the Spirit. The Spirit then brings us back to the Father through the Son. This is marvelous! The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father through the Son. Through this wonderful two-way traffic we enjoy the threefold dispensing of life by the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>The first issue of the divine dispensing is that we are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God (v. 19). Also, the Gentile believers are being built together with the Jewish believers upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ as the cornerstone (v. 20). Such a building has the wonderful Christ as the joining cornerstone. This building is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, a holy dwelling place of God (v. 21). This indicates that the holy temple is a living building, for a physical building does not grow. In order to enlarge a material structure we need to build something further. But the church as God&rsquo;s building grows because it is organic. The church grows by life-dispensing. The threefold God&mdash;God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is dispensing Himself into us as life and as our life supply. As long as He is dispensing Himself into us, we are nourished and we grow. He dispenses, and we grow. This is the building of the church into a temple.</p>
<p>Actually, the word &ldquo;temple&rdquo; here should be translated sanctuary, meaning the central part of the temple in the Lord. Such a sanctuary is God&rsquo;s dwelling place in our spirit (v. 22). The church life today is in our spirit. Practically speaking, when you are out of your spirit, you are out of the church. If you are not in your spirit, although you may be in the meeting, you are not in the church in a practical way. The church life is in our human spirit. We must always turn to our spirt, exercise our spirit, and walk according to our spirit. We should not be out of our spirit nor have our being apart from our spirit. We must walk, live, act, and have our being in our spirit. When we exercise our spirit in this way, we are in the church. This is for God&rsquo;s dispensing of Himself into us as life so that we may grow in the church. Both God&rsquo;s dispensing and our growing are in the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:1-21</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISPENSATION OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the first message of this series we saw that chapter one of Ephesians reveals the plan of God the Father. In the second message we saw that chapter two reveals mainly the Son&rsquo;s accomplishment to dispense the Trinity into our being so that we may grow into the dwelling place of God. In this message we come to chapter three where we have the dispensation of God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>The word dispensation used in chapter three is an equivalent of the Greek word <em>oikonomia</em> which is composed of two words: <em>oikos,</em> which means house, and <em>nomos,</em> which means law. <em>Oikonomia</em> denotes household regulations or household management. Because this word refers to a household administration and arrangement, it implies a plan. Some Bible teachers have pointed out that there are seven dispensations for God&rsquo;s dealing with man. In Ephesians 3 the word dispensation means a plan, an arrangement, a system, or an order.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Dispensation or the Stewardship<br />
of the Grace of God</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 3 the word <em>oikonomia</em> is used twice, in verses 2 and 9. In verse 2 it is better to translate it as stewardship, and in verse 9, as dispensation. In English a stewardship refers to the duty, office, or responsibility of one who is carrying out the dispensation. A steward is a servant who carries out the household management and administration. The stewardship is even a part of the dispensation. This is why Paul used the word <em>oikonomia</em> to denote both the dispensation and the duty of the steward to carry out the dispensation.</p>
<p>The church is God&rsquo;s house, and in His house, He has a plan, an arrangement, a household administration, to distribute the riches of Christ into all the members of this household. Paul and the other apostles were not the only stewards to carry out this dispensation. Peter in his First Epistle says that we all should minister the gift we have received &ldquo;as good stewards of the varied grace of God&rdquo; (1 Pet. 4:10b). The word &ldquo;stewards&rdquo; in 1 Peter 4:10 does not refer to the duty or responsibility of the servant; it refers to the steward himself, the one who carries out the household management. Every one of us should be a good steward of the varied grace of God to distribute the riches of Christ to nourish all the saints in the church.</p>
<p>When we use the word dispensation, we mean God&rsquo;s household management, God&rsquo;s plan. We do not mean dispensing. Nevertheless, in God&rsquo;s dispensation the crucial matter is the dispensing of Himself into us. In God&rsquo;s dispensation there is the dispensing. Paul may be considered the leading steward to carry out God&rsquo;s divine dispensation, that is, to carry out God&rsquo;s divine, eternal plan to dispense and distribute all the riches of Christ. Paul was commissioned with such a responsibility, such a service. This may be considered a stewardship. It also may be considered a dispensation. Paul had been committed with God&rsquo;s plan, His dispensation, to distribute the grace of God. Such a plan to distribute the grace of God is called the dispensation of the grace of God. Paul was commissioned and committed by God with this plan to carry out God&rsquo;s dispensing of His riches as grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Dispensation of the Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>In the dispensation, the plan, of the mystery of Christ there are three main items. The first is to make the nations joint-heirs, a joint Body, and joint-partakers of the promise in Christ (v. 6). God&rsquo;s plan, His household administration, is to make the Jewish and Gentile believers joint-heirs of God. All these joint-heirs are in the one joint Body, which is the Body of Christ, the church. Furthermore, the joint-heirs are joint-partakers of the promise in Christ, that is, joint-partakers of all the riches in Christ.</p>
<p>Second, God desires to distribute the unsearchable riches of Christ to the nations (v. 8). How can the Gentiles be made joint-heirs of God? This can only be through the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>Paul was a dispenser. We may compare him to Joseph in the Old Testament. Joseph was the steward in Pharaoh&rsquo;s rich house (Gen. 41:41). The king of Egypt had a great house full of food supply, and he needed a household administration to distribute this supply. Joseph was appointed to be a steward with the commission to distribute food. We may consider Paul a New Testament Joseph to distribute all the rich food in Christ to God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>The dispensing of the rich food of God&rsquo;s household is to make the nations, the Gentiles, joint-heirs of God with the Jewish believers. This cannot be done by education or organization. It can only be done by life-dispensing. Paul did not use organization to dispense the riches. In chapter three he told us that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ (v. 8). Here the word &ldquo;preach&rdquo; actually means to distribute or dispense. Paul&rsquo;s ministry was to dispense the unsearchable riches of Christ to the nations. Even today I regard Paul as my Joseph. Whenever I come to his Epistles, I receive a rich supply of food. Paul&rsquo;s distribution of the unsearchable riches of Christ was to make the nations joint-heirs with the Jews.</p>
<p>Third, the dispensation of the mystery of Christ is to bring forth the church for the manifestation of the multifarious wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose made by God in Christ (vv. 9-11). Out of the distribution and dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ, the church is produced to exhibit God&rsquo;s manifold or multifarious wisdom. God exhibits this wisdom not mainly to man, but to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, that is, to the evil angels, the followers of Satan. God has set up an exhibition to let the fallen angels see how much wisdom He has. To those on earth the church is a poem, a masterpiece, but to the fallen angels in the air the church is a great exhibition. Through the church they can see God&rsquo;s wisdom. This is God&rsquo;s plan, which is the dispensation of God&rsquo;s grace.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s plan, His dispensation, the main thing is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The dispensing in chapter three of Ephesians is deeper and more intimate than that in chapter one. In Ephesians 1 we have a sketch of the dispensing. But in chapter three the dispensing of the Trinity is deeper, more particular, and more intimate. We can realize this because of Paul&rsquo;s prayer in this chapter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Father Strengthening<br />
with Power according to the Riches<br />
of His Glory</h2>
<p>Paul, the leading steward, prayed for the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. First, he said that he bowed his knees to the Father (v. 14). This means that he appealed to the source. He bowed his knees to the Father that He would strengthen the believers with power according to the riches of His glory through the Spirit into their inner man (v. 16). Our inner man is our spirit regenerated by and mingled with the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Spirit</h2>
<p>The Spirit through whom the Father strengthens us is in our spirit. Not only is He dwelling in our spirit; He is even mingled with our spirit. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; is very significant. The Spirit is with our spirit. This indicates mingling. Our inner man is a wonderful mingled spirit. This corresponds to 1 Corinthians 6:17: &ldquo;But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; How can we be one spirit with the Lord? It is only by the Lord as the Spirit mingling Himself with our spirit. The divine Spirit has mingled with our human spirit to become one spirit. This is wonderful! The Father strengthens us through the Spirit into our inner man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Into Our Inner Man&mdash;<br />
Our Regenerated and Mingled Spirit</h2>
<p>What does it mean to be strengthened through the Spirit with power according to the riches of God&rsquo;s glory into our inner man? Let us consider our experience. Many times we Christians became bothered, puzzled, or even disappointed. The more we look at the environment and the more we consider our situation, the more we feel that we are poor and that we cannot go on. We may feel that we would not go to a meeting until something great happens to revive us. The more we think this way, the more we are weakened. The more we think this way, the more we remain in our subtle, deceiving, and even deceived mentality.</p>
<p>Suppose, when you come home from work on Friday evening, you are depressed and disappointed. It has been a poor day; nothing has gone well. When you come home, you are unhappy with your wife and children. Even your room does not seem pleasant to you. The more you consider your situation, the worse it seems. At such a time you need to remember Paul&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you...to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.&rdquo; Then you should declare, &ldquo;Satan, get away from me! I will enter into my inner man.&rdquo; If you turn to your inner man, you will be stirred up and strengthened. If you go on to pray for a few minutes, you will be strengthened even more. This strengthening even swallows up your physical weakness and tiredness.</p>
<p>I encourage you to practice in this way. Never say that you are weak, or that you are tired, no matter how you feel. Sisters, when your husband comes home from work saying that he is tired, you should charge him not to say that he is tired, but to bow his knees to the Father that he would be strengthened with power into his inner man. When you say you are tired, you are in your old man, your outer man, your mentality. You need to be strengthened into the inner man. Do not remain in the outer man. You may be tired, but He is not tired. He who lives within you is much stronger than you. He is never tired. He would strengthen you into the inner man.</p>
<p>In the phrase &ldquo;into the inner man,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;into&rdquo; is very significant. To say that we need to be strengthened into the inner man indicates that we are not in the inner man, that we live mostly in the outer man. When a brother tells his wife that he is tired, he is in the outer man, in the mind, living according to his physical tiredness. Therefore, he seeks pity from his wife. Sisters, do not sympathize with your husband. When he says that he is tired, encourage him to bow his knees to the Father that the Father would strengthen him with power through the Spirit into his inner man.</p>
<p>When you say that you are tired, you are outside of the inner man. You have an inner man. Why not stay there? Why stay in your tiredness? You need to practice bowing your knees to the Father that He would strengthen you into your inner man from your tiredness. Even when we are sick, we need to pray that the Father would strengthen us from our sickness into our inner man.</p>
<p>We may also use married life as an illustration. Many times married life is not sweet; instead, it may be somewhat bitter. Our married life can be sweet and happy only when we are strengthened into the inner man. Sometimes after her husband has gone to work, a sister may begin to consider how he has been treating her. Perhaps last night he was unhappy with her, and this morning he said she was wrong in certain things. Then she may begin to consider whether she is wrong or right. The more she thinks about these things, the more darkness she will have within her. This indicates that she is in the outer man, in her mentality. The only thing that can help in this kind of situation is to be strengthened into the inner man. She should not stay in her mentality, her mind, her thinking. If we are in such a situation, we need to be strengthened from our thinking into our inner man and turn to our spirit and pray. If we practice this in every situation, we shall be strong Christians. Through this practice the divine dispensing has a way to infuse us with all the riches of the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ the Son Making His Home</h2>
<p>When we are strengthened into our inner man, Christ can make His home in our heart (vv. 16-17). For Christ to make His home in our heart is a great matter. This is to have Himself fully settled in our inner being. Our heart is composed of four parts: the emotion, the will, the mind, and the conscience. For Christ to make His home in our heart means that He must settle Himself in our emotion, will, mind, and conscience. This means that Christ needs to occupy every part of our being.</p>
<p>We may compare our heart to an apartment with many rooms. One room is the mind and other rooms are the will, the emotion, and the conscience. We have believed in the Lord, and we have Him within us, but he still needs to make His home in our heart. Paul prayed for the Ephesians that Christ would have a way to make His home in their hearts. We have Christ in us in a general way, but we may not have Christ in us in a particular way, saturating our mind, emotion, will, and conscience.</p>
<p>I travel frequently, and many times I am placed in a room as a guest. Often the host will encourage me to feel at home. But as a guest receiving hospitality I never have the feeling that I am at home. I am just staying there temporarily. I cannot be settled in that place because it is not my home.</p>
<p>Christ desires to make His home in our heart, to occupy every part of our heart. He wants to occupy every part of our inner being. Our inner being must be saturated, possessed, occupied, and filled with Christ. If Christ has made His home in our heart, if He has occupied every room of our heart, we shall not be weak. On the contrary, we shall be those with a holy and even spiritual living. Too many times, however, we do not feel that we are strong in our spiritual life. The reason is that we have Christ in us in a very general way. Perhaps you have received Christ only into a corner of your &ldquo;living room.&rdquo; You have not given Him the liberty to move into another part. The result is that you are weak. You have Christ, but you are still weak because you are not saturated with Christ. You are short of the life-dispensing into your mind, emotion, will, and conscience to saturate your entire being. But if you have been thoroughly saturated by Christ through the life-dispensing in every part of your inward being&mdash;in your mind, emotion, will, and conscience&mdash;you will be strong. You will truly be one with the Lord. This was Paul&rsquo;s goal as a leading steward and distributor of God&rsquo;s grace. He desired that all the saints under his ministry would be saturated with the divine dispensing of life so they would be fully occupied by Christ in their inward parts. For this reason he bowed his knees to the Father that they would be strengthened with power according to the riches of His glory through the Spirit, that Christ may make His home in their hearts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Be Filled unto All the Fullness of God</h2>
<p>When Christ makes His home in our heart, we shall be filled not <em>with</em> all the fullness of God, but <em>unto</em> all the fullness of God (3:19). If we let Christ make His home in our heart, we shall be filled with the Godhead, the Trinity, to such an extent that we shall become His full expression.</p>
<p>The fullness here does not mean the riches; it denotes the expression, the manifestation, of the riches. For example, when you fill a cup with water, it is not until the water fills the cup to the brim and overflows that you can see the fullness of the water. The overflow is the fullness of the water. That overflow as the fullness of the water is the expression of the water. But if only a small amount of water is contained in the cup, no one can see the water. In a similar way, we must be strengthened through the Spirit so that Christ may make His home in our heart to fill us to the brim and even overflow from our inner being. When we are filled up to such an extent that Christ overflows from within our being, we become the fullness of God, the expression of God. Then others will be able to see that God is overflowing from within us. This overflowing is God&rsquo;s full expression. This thought is higher, deeper, richer, and more profound than what is mentioned in chapter one. Chapter one speaks of the fullness of Christ (v. 23), but chapter three speaks of the fullness of God, which is wider and richer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">By Him Who Is Able to Do According<br />
to His Power Which Operates in Us</h2>
<p>For us to be filled unto all the fullness of God is something worked out by Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to His power which operates in us (v. 20).</p>
<h2 class="head2">For His Glory in the Church<br />
and in Christ Jesus unto Eternity</h2>
<p>Eventually, our being filled unto all the fullness of God and His working in us according to His power operating in us will be for His glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto eternity (v. 21).</p>
<p>The crucial point in Ephesians 3 is that we need the Father&rsquo;s strengthening through the Spirit so that the Son may have a free course to make His home in our heart to occupy our entire being, that we may have an overflow of the riches of Christ to be the full expression of God. This is worked out by the life-dispensing, the dispensing of the Triune God to make us His full expression.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
INTO A FULL-GROWN MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-32</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE GIVEN ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE<br />
OF THE GIFT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4 is a long chapter containing many &ldquo;diamonds.&rdquo; The first of these diamonds is the grace revealed in this chapter. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;But to each one of us was given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.&rdquo; Here grace is given according to the gift, but in Romans 12:6 the gifts differ according to grace. Grace is the divine life that both produces and supplies the gifts. In Romans 12 grace produces the gifts, and therefore the gifts are according to grace. But in Ephesians 4 grace supplies the gifts, and therefore grace is according to the measure of the gift. First the divine life produces the gift, and then it supplies the gift. Such a producing and supplying life is grace, which is given according to the measure of the gift.</p>
<p>The measure of the gift of Christ refers to the size of a particular member of His Body. This measure can be compared to the way blood is supplied to the members of our physical body according to their size. A shoulder, being a large member, receives a large volume of blood, whereas a finger, being a small member, receives a small amount of blood. The supply of blood is according to the size of the members of our body. In the Lord&rsquo;s Body, the Body of Christ, certain members are large. These members include the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Paul, Peter, and John were large members of the Body, and much grace and divine life were supplied to them.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 4:7, grace is something high and profound. Grace is actually the divine life dispensed into our being to supply us as gifts in the Lord&rsquo;s Body.</p>
<p>Grace is also mentioned in verse 29: &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; Grace is Christ as our enjoyment and supply, and our word should convey this grace to others. The word that builds up others always ministers grace to those who hear. In verses 7 and 29 grace refers to Christ as the divine life dispensed into our being for our enjoyment and supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH IN JESUS</h2>
<p>Another diamond in Ephesians 4 is truth: &ldquo;Since indeed you have heard Him and been taught in Him as the truth is in Jesus&rdquo; (v. 21). The truth in Jesus is the real situation of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity. But in the godly life of Jesus there is truth, reality. Jesus lived a life of doing everything in God, with God, and for God. God was in His life, and He was one with God. This is the truth in Jesus. We, the believers, regenerated with Christ as life and taught in Him, learn from Him as the truth is in Jesus. The truth in Jesus is God Himself. According to the Gospels, Jesus lived a life not merely of morality or ethics, but of God. His life expressed God. God is the reality of His life, and this reality is truth. Therefore, instead of saying &ldquo;as the truth is in Jesus,&rdquo; we may say &ldquo;as God is in Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning truth, verse 24 says, &ldquo;And have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.&rdquo; The definite article before truth in this verse is emphatic. As the deceit in verse 22 related to the old man is the personification of Satan, so the truth here related to the new man is God&rsquo;s personification. As mentioned in verse 21, this truth was exhibited in the life of Jesus. In the life of Jesus righteousness and holiness of truth were always manifested. In the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, the new man was created.</p><h2 class="head1">A DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Both grace and truth are covered in chapter four of Ephesians. In chapter one of the Gospel of John grace and truth are also mentioned. The Word was God, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth (John 1:1, 14). The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ (John 1:17). Ephesians 4 is a full definition of the grace and truth found in John 1. If you would understand the grace and truth revealed in John 1, you need to study Ephesians 4.</p>
<p>Grace and truth are the elements of which chapter four of Ephesians is constituted. Ephesians 1 is structured with the Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination, the Son&rsquo;s redemption, and the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging. In Ephesians 4 we have not only the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, but also grace and truth. This indicates development and progress.</p>
<p>In both John 1 and Ephesians 4 there is a development of the Triune God. John 1:14 says that the Word, which was God, became flesh. The word &ldquo;became&rdquo; indicates development. This One who became flesh and tabernacled among us was full of grace and truth. This is a further development. As God, He was developed to become a man in the flesh. As God incarnate, He was further developed to become grace and truth to us. In Ephesians 1 we see the Triune God, but we do not have the full development of grace and truth. If we would see this development, we need to come to Ephesians 4.</p>
<p>The book of Ephesians is profound. This book cannot be understood by merely reading it according to the letters. We need revelation. This was the reason Paul prayed that the Father would grant the believers a spirit of wisdom and revelation (Eph. 1:17). Natural intelligence or cleverness will not help us to understand such a deep book. We need divine wisdom and revelation.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 1 there is the dispensing of the Triune God to produce the church, the Body of Christ. In this chapter there is little development. But in chapters two and three there is a development that issues in the Body. The topic of Ephesians 4 is the Body; the topic of this chapter is not the Triune God. However, the Body has much to do with the Triune God. In chapter one there is the indication that the Body would be produced. But in chapter four we actually have the Body.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4 Paul first speaks of the one Body and then of the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God, the Father. This indicates that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;has been developed in the Body. This corresponds to John 1, where the eternal God became flesh and experienced a development in the flesh. In Ephesians 4 the Triune God has been developed not merely in the flesh, but in the Body of Christ. Furthermore, in John 1 there is the development of God in the flesh issuing in grace and truth. In Ephesians 4 there is also the development of the Triune God issuing in grace and truth. In John the eternal God was developed in the flesh and issued in grace and truth, and in Ephesians the Triune God was developed in the Body and issued in grace and truth. In order to understand Ephesians 4 we need to see this development.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Another diamond in Ephesians 4 is the life of God found in verse 18: &ldquo;Being darkened in their understanding, estranged from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart.&rdquo; The Gentiles, who walk in vanity, have been estranged from the life of God and excluded from it because of the ignorance which is in them and because of the hardness of their heart. They have ceased from feeling and have given themselves over to sinful things. The life of God in Ephesians 4:18 corresponds to the life in John 1:4, a verse which says, &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; In John 1 we have grace, truth, and the life of God. In Ephesians 4 we also have these three matters. The difference is that in John 1 there is the flesh, but in Ephesians 4 there is the Body. In John 1 the flesh is the sphere, the element, for God&rsquo;s development. In Ephesians 4 the mystical Body, the church, is the sphere, the element, for the development of the Triune God. However, in both cases the issue is the same&mdash;grace and truth of life. Both grace and truth are of life, and life is actually God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY MINGLED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4 is on the Body of Christ as the development of the Triune God. The Body is mingled with the Triune God because with the Body the Trinity is mentioned in a detailed way. In Ephesians 4:4-6 we have one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God, the Father. Therefore, the Triune God is closely related to the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">One God and Father of All</h2>
<p>When Paul speaks of the one God and Father of all in verse 6, he says that the Father is over all, through all, and in all. This points to a mingling of the Triune God with the Body. How is it possible for God the Father to be in three positions, above all, through all, and in all? This is possible because God is triune. Even God the Father is triune. The Father&rsquo;s position is above all, the Son&rsquo;s position is through all, and the Spirit&rsquo;s position is in all. Therefore, God the Father possesses all the positions of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is above all as the Father, He is through all as the Son, and He is in all as the Spirit. Hence, the church as the mystical Body is mingled with the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">One Body, One Spirit, One Hope</h2>
<p>With the one Body and the one Spirit, there is one hope (v. 4). At present our body is still in the physical life; it has not yet been transfigured. However, there is the hope that one day our physical body will be transfigured, that is, glorified. On that day the indwelling Christ will be manifested in glory. This glory is a hope to the Body with the Spirit. Thus, we have one Body and one Spirit with one hope. The mystical Body of Christ is wonderful, and the Spirit mingled with this mystical Body is also wonderful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">One Lord</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 4:5 Paul goes on to speak of the one Lord. As long as the Body is mingled with the Spirit, the Body is joined to the Lord. Actually, the Spirit is the Lord (2 Cor. 3:17). We cannot separate the Spirit from the Lord. As we pointed out in a foregoing message, when the Son comes, the Father comes also, and when the Spirit comes, both the Son and the Father come with Him. Now the Body is mingled with the Spirit, and the Spirit cannot be separated from the Son and the Father. We have the Spirit, the Son, and the Father. Therefore, because the Body is mingled with the Spirit, we also have the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">One Faith and One Baptism</h2>
<p>With the Lord we have one faith and one baptism. Faith joins us to the Lord. When we believe in the Lord, we enter into an organic union with Him. In this life-union we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Faith joins us to the Lord because we have believed into Him.</p>
<p>Baptism has two aspects. On the one hand, we have been baptized into Christ; on the other hand, we have been terminated from Adam. We were born in Adam, but by baptism we were transferred out of Adam into Christ. Therefore, negatively, baptism signifies termination, and positively, it signifies union. By faith and baptism we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. Now we have an organic union with Christ the Lord.</p>
<p>Because we have the Spirit, we have the Lord and also the Father, who is above all, through all, and in all. This is the issue of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>The Trinity revealed in Ephesians 1 has been dispensed into all the believers, and this dispensing issues in the Body. In Ephesians 4 we see that the Body is mingled with the Triune God who dispenses Himself into us. The Triune God is dispensing Himself into the believers in order to make them an organic Body, which is mingled with the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN REALITY</h2>
<p>As members of the Body we should no longer walk as the nations walk, in the vanity of their mind (v. 17). Instead, we should walk in reality; we should walk as the truth is in Jesus. According to the four Gospels, when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He never walked in vanity. He always walked in God, who is the reality. Now we should walk in the same God, in the One who has been dispensed into us as grace for our enjoyment and as truth for our reality. Today it is possible for us to have such a life, such a walk, full of enjoyment and reality. Grace and truth are the issue of the dispensing of the Trinity. The enjoyment is God as our grace, and reality is God as our truth. Hence, we may walk in enjoyment and reality. We may enjoy and experience God as grace and reality. If we do this, we shall live in reality, not in vanity. This results from the dispensing of the Trinity into us as life.</p>
<p>Grace and reality, or grace and truth, are both of life. Life is the essence of grace. The divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life of God, is also the essence of reality. This life is God Himself. This means that the being of the Triune God is life. The Lord Jesus clearly said that He is life (John 11:25; 14:6). Also, God is life. Speaking of God, John 1:4 says that in Him was life. Furthermore, the Spirit is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Therefore, life is the being of the Triune God. In contrast, Satan is death. The being of our God is life, but the being of Satan is death.</p>
<p>When God dispenses Himself into us, we have life. On the one hand, this life is our grace for enjoyment; on the other hand, this life is our reality for us to live a real life. Our daily life should not be vain. We should not live in vanity or emptiness, but live in reality, in truth. This truth is the Triune God dispensed into us as our life.</p><h2 class="head1">A MINGLING IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Although chapter four of Ephesians covers many matters, the crucial matters revealed in this chapter are the Body, the mingling with the Triune God, life, grace, and truth or reality. This chapter reveals that the Body is mingled with the Divine Trinity. This mingling is a matter of life. To say that the Body is mingled with the Divine Trinity means that the Body is saturated with life, permeated with life, and soaked with life. This life is nothing less than the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In our daily walk, this life is our enjoyment. This is grace. Furthermore, this life is also our reality so that we may have a real living. Therefore, we should not live in vanity; we should live in reality. In the divine life, which is actually the Triune God mingled with the church, we have grace, enjoyment. This life is also our reality. The experience of the divine life as grace and reality is due to the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWTH, THE CONTINUATION OF LIFE-DISPENSING</h2>
<p>Another diamond in Ephesians 4 is indicated by the word &ldquo;grow.&rdquo; The verb form is found in verse 15; the noun form, growth, in verse 16; and the participle form, full-grown, in verse 13. The sonship in Ephesians 1 is a matter of life-dispensing. What is growth? Growth is the continuation of life-dispensing. Life-dispensing began in the new birth, and it continues with growth. This life-dispensing never ceases. When the life-dispensing first reached us, it caused us to have a new birth. Now the life-dispensing continues daily, and as it continues we grow. I am happy to see the saints growing in the churches. This is the growth in life by grace and reality. With the saints in the local churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there are the enjoyment of grace and also the reality of the truth. Grace supplies, and truth shines. We are under this supplying and shining, and this causes us to grow.</p>
<p>Do not expect to grow in a fast way. If you make artificial flowers, you can produce many overnight. But you cannot produce real flowers overnight. You need to be patient and let these flowers grow. In the churches we should care for genuine growth. I am happy to see that the churches are growing through the dispensing of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR MIND</h2>
<p>The growing by the dispensing of life is also the renewing. Verses 23 and 24 say, &ldquo;And are being renewed in the spirit of your mind, and have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.&rdquo; In these verses there seems to be a contradiction. On the one hand, we are told that we have put on the new man; on the other hand, we are told that we are being renewed. Since we have already put on the new man, why must we be renewed? It is because of the situation in our soul and body that we need to be renewed. Our spirit has been renewed already but our soul and body have not. Therefore, as far as our physical being is concerned, there is the need for renewing.</p>
<p>Where does this renewing take place? Paul tells us clearly that the renewing is in the spirit of our mind. Our mind is the main part of our soul. This indicates that our spirit must spread into the mind of our soul until it becomes the spirit of our mind. Our mind needs to be saturated with the spirit, and it needs to be under the control and direction of the spirit. Our mind should not be the main factor ruling over us; rather, the spirit of our mind should be the main factor ruling, reigning, and directing us in all things.</p>
<p>Since birth, we have behaved ourselves according to our mind. Verse 17 says that the nations walk in the vanity of their mind. As those who love Christ, we should not have vanity in our mind. Instead, we should have the spirit in our mind. Our mind should no longer be full of vanity, but should be saturated with the spirit.</p>
<p>You should never belittle your spirit. When you believed in the Lord Jesus, He as the life-giving Spirit entered your spirit and regenerated you with Himself as life. Your regenerated spirit, therefore, is very significant. Because you have not only a human spirit but a regenerated spirit born of God, with the indwelling Christ as your life, you have become a person who is weighty and who has a high standard. We all have a wonderful mingled spirit. This mingled spirit is our inner man. In Ephesians 3 Paul says that we need to be strengthened by God the Father into this inner man (3:16). Now in Ephesians 4 we see that this inner man should spread from our spirit into our mind.</p>
<p>We need to be continually renewed in the spirit that is saturating our mind. This means that we should not think anything without being controlled by the spirit. We must have a mind that is filled and saturated with the spirit. When our mind is saturated with the regenerated spirit it is saturated with the Triune God, who is in our regenerated spirit. This means that our mind is filled with the spirit, which in turn is filled with the Triune God. In this way we are being renewed.</p>
<p>Renewing is equal to growth. Daily we are growing and are being renewed. Both the renewing and the growing are by the life-dispensing of the Triune God. Therefore, we need to contact Him, pray to Him, call upon Him, and have fellowship with Him. We also need to read His Word. By doing these things we stay with Him, and we keep ourselves open to His life-dispensing. While the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us as our life, we enjoy grace and reality, we are being renewed, and we grow.</p><h2 class="head1">MINISTERING GRACE</h2>
<p>Every member of the Body, whether small or large, has received something of the Triune God as supply, as grace ministered to that member. Large members, such as Peter and Paul, could minister the riches of Christ into all the churches. But even small members can receive grace and minister this grace to others. For example, at home you may minister grace to your wife or husband through your speaking, and this grace will build them up. This is the ministry of life. Do not think that you are too small a member to minister grace to others. Every member of the Body is able to minister grace.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 speaks of the operation in measure of each one part. According to the measure of every part, the Body enjoys the supply by which it grows. Of course, there are the joints of supply, which are large members such as Paul. Such members are life-joints full of supply. But even we who are small members have a measure, and according to the measure of every part, the Body is supplied to grow. This is the life-dispensing of the Triune God for the building up of the Body.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I have seen many brothers and sisters, who are small members of the Body, minister grace as life supply to others. Because they are under the dispensing of the Triune God, enjoying grace and realizing reality, spontaneously they speak to their fellow members. This speaking conveys grace to the other members so that they may be nourished and grow. All the members in the local churches may be life suppliers. Whether we speak to others in a message or speak to them in our daily living, we may minister grace because we are under the life-dispensing of the Triune God. Both in the meetings and in our daily life the principle is the same&mdash;it is a matter of ministering grace through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:1&mdash;6:9</h1>
<p>The revelation in the book of Ephesians is progressive. According to this principle we would expect chapter five to be more advanced than the previous four chapters. In chapter one there is a sketch with a plan. Then in chapter two this plan is carried out, it advances in chapter three, and it comes to its development in chapter four. In this message we shall consider the progress in chapter five.</p>
<p>It is not easy to understand the book of Ephesians, because it was written in a very deep way. When we read this book, we need to dig into its depths in order to discover the basic elements.</p>
<p>Another principle is that a writer always has a basic thought within him before he writes something. This principle applies to Paul&rsquo;s writing in Ephesians 5. Chapter five of Ephesians must have certain basic elements or factors. If we can find these basic factors, we shall have the key to understanding this chapter.</p>
<p>In the foregoing message we saw that in chapter four of Ephesians there were certain basic factors: the Body, the Body mingled with the Divine Trinity, the development in life and grace and truth. One point I did not emphasize in the previous message is that the Body mingled with the Trinity in the development of life and grace and truth is altogether for the new man. The concept of the church as the Body is found in chapter one. The issue of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:23). Hence, the first concept concerning the church in Ephesians is that of the Body. In chapter two the Body is mentioned again, and the thought of the new man is brought in. In His death on the cross, Christ abolished all of the commandments in ordinances to create a new man out of the Jews and the Gentiles (2:15). This new man in chapter two is the Body. In chapter one the thought of the Body is introduced, and in chapter two the thought of the new man is introduced. However, in chapter one the Body is not developed, and in chapter two the new man is not developed. In Ephesians 4 there is the development of the Body. In chapter four we see that the Body is mingled with the Trinity in life, grace, and truth. Eventually, in its development the Body is the new man. Therefore, the development of the Body in its being mingled with the Divine Trinity in life, grace, and truth is for the new man.</p>
<p>Now let us come to chapter five of Ephesians. According to the principle of progression, this chapter should be another step of advancement.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR LAYERS OF VEILS</h2>
<p>It is not easy for us to see what is in Ephesians 5 because we have layer upon layer of veils covering our spiritual eyes. No matter what our background may be, we may say that we Christians all have four layers of veils that hinder our sight. Because of these veils, we may read the Word and yet not see anything. The first veil is related to the fact that we are natural. Every living creature has a certain kind of nature. A dog has a dog&rsquo;s nature, and a cat has a cat&rsquo;s nature. Of course, as human beings, we have a nature that is higher than that of a dog or a cat. The human nature created by God includes an ethical element. This means that by nature we are ethical. It is according to our created human nature to do good and to be good. Even little children have in their nature the inclination or tendency to be good. When they are right, they are proud and want you to see them, but when they are wrong, they want to stay away from you. They do not want others to see that they are wrong or know that they are wrong. This indicates that by nature human beings are ethical. This comes from God&rsquo;s creation. The first veil is this ethical element in our created human nature.</p>
<p>The second veil is culture. Every race of mankind has its culture. It is extremely difficult for us to forget our culture. Culture is a thick veil that keeps us from seeing the truth in the Bible.</p>
<p>The third veil is religion. Very few people have no religion at all. Christianity is a religion with many different beliefs. In a sense, every belief is a religion.</p>
<p>The fourth veil is also related to ethics, but to ethics that come from education and training, not to the ethics that are in man&rsquo;s nature by creation. For example, the ethical teachings of Confucius have influenced people of different nationalities in the Far East. In the West people are influenced by ethics that are according to the teachings of Christianity.</p>
<p>Everyone has these four layers of veils: the natural makeup with its ethical element, culture, religion, and the ethics acquired through teaching or training. These four matters have become part of our constitution. This means that our being is constituted of our nature, culture, religion, and ethics.</p>
<p>If you are still under these four layers of veils as you read Ephesians 5, you will not be able to understand this chapter properly. You will not understand such matters as being imitators of God as beloved children or walking in love. However, if you are a wife, you may be happy to learn that Ephesians 5:25 commands husbands to love their wives. Suppose a sister has been bothered by her husband and feels that he has been rather cold toward her. While she is thinking this way about her husband, she reads chapter five of Ephesians. Although she may not understand any other verse, she may pay attention to the verse regarding husbands loving their wives. Actually, she does not receive anything from the Scriptures. Instead, she inserts her own thought into the Bible.</p>
<p>A brother who is a husband may do the same thing with the verse that says that wives should be subject to their own husbands. He may not pay attention to Paul&rsquo;s word about husbands loving their wives, but he may be happy to read that Paul tells the wives to be subject to their own husbands.</p>
<p>These two illustrations show us our problem when we come to the Word. Whenever we come to the Bible, we come with our thought, concept, desire, aspiration, attitude, opinion, or understanding. All these things have their source in our nature, culture, religion, and ethics. It is difficult to find a Christian who comes to the Bible free from the influence of these four things. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 5:3). If we are truly poor in spirit, we shall not be occupied by our nature, culture, religion, or ethics. Then we shall come to the Word with an empty spirit, a pure heart, and a sober mind.</p><h2 class="head1">IMITATORS OF GOD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5 opens with these words: &ldquo;Become therefore imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in love...&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). Then in the following verses Paul goes on to say that we need to walk as children of light (vv. 2-14) who understand the will of the Lord (vv. 15-17). In chapter four we saw two striking matters&mdash;grace and truth. In chapter five there are also two striking matters&mdash;love and light. Verse 2 says that we should walk in love, and verse 8 says that we should walk as children of light. In the divine reality grace and truth are a pair, and love and light also are a pair.</p>
<p>In his Gospel, the Apostle John emphasized grace and truth. He said that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth (John 1:14). But in his first Epistle John does not emphasize grace and truth; instead, he emphasizes love and light. In 4:8 he says that God is love and in 1:5 that God is light. He does not say that God has love or light; he says that God is love and light. Love and light, therefore, are actually God Himself. They are God&rsquo;s being, His essence.</p>
<p>Although the Bible tells us that God is love and light, there is no verse which says that God is grace. Rather, we are told that grace and truth came (John 1:17). The word &ldquo;came&rdquo; is significant in what it indicates. This word indicates that grace has a source, that grace came from somewhere. When Christ was incarnated, He came with grace and truth. We know, of course, that the source of the Lord Jesus was God, for He came from God the Father. No doubt, grace and truth also came from God the Father. Therefore, God is the source of grace and truth. God the Father is love and light. Love is the source of grace, and light is the source of truth.</p>
<p>This understanding is confirmed by 2 Corinthians 13:14: &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; In this verse the love of God is the source, the grace of Christ is what proceeds from that source, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the transmission, that which passes on this grace to us. Likewise, love is a source, and grace is the outcome. Light is a source, and truth is the outcome. Grace and truth come out of God the Father, but love and light are God the Father. Once we receive grace and truth, we may go back to God to contact Him and have fellowship with Him. When we go back to God in this way, we reach love and light. This means we touch the source of grace and truth. First we believe in the Lord Jesus and receive grace and truth. Then by enjoying grace and truth we are brought back to the source of grace and truth, God the Father as love and light. By staying in such a fellowship we become a beloved child of God walking in love.</p>
<p>What is revealed in chapter five concerning love and light is deeper than what is revealed in chapter four concerning grace and truth. In chapter four we walk in grace, but in chapter five we walk in love. By walking in love we become a child of light, not just a person of truth. It is in this way that we can become an imitator of God, the One who is love and light. This is a great advancement and progression, an advancement from grace to love and from truth to light. We who seek Christ and love God should be children of light walking in love. Because both light and love are God, this means we are children of God walking in God. To be children of light walking in love actually means that we are children of God walking in God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BY THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<p>How can we be the children of light walking in love? This is possible only by the Father dispensing Himself into us in the Son through the Spirit. When the Triune God is dispensed into us, we become in a practical way the children of God, who is light. Then as children of light, not only do we live by grace, but we live directly in God, who is light and love. Therefore, the dispensing of the Divine Trinity constitutes us children of light walking in love, or we may say children of God walking in God.</p>
<p>Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity we all need to be filled in our spirit with the Spirit as the divine wine (v. 18). If we are filled in our spirit in this way, then we shall speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs (v. 19a), we shall be singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord (v. 19b), and we shall be giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father (v. 20). When we have the Triune God dispensed into us thoroughly to make us children of light walking in love, we shall be able to declare, &ldquo;This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long.&rdquo; We shall praise Him with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Psalms are long poems, hymns are of medium length, and spiritual songs are short verses.</p>
<p>According to verse 18, we should not be drunk with wine, but we should be filled in spirit. We should be filled with God, even &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; with Him, not drunk with wine. God&rsquo;s love is better than wine. Song of Songs 1:2 says, &ldquo;Thy love is better than wine.&rdquo; We do not care to drink wine, but we desire to drink God&rsquo;s love, which is better than wine. We want to soak in His love, to bathe in it. We want to be those who are permeated and saturated with God&rsquo;s love and even drunk with His love.</p>
<p>One who is a child of light, walking in love, will be beside himself with God. This means that a child of light should be drunk with God. A proper Christian is one who is beside himself with the enjoyment of the Lord. If you are always silent, you are not a typical Christian. A typical Christian should be drunk with the love of the Lord. We all need to be drunk with God as our love and light. Then we shall truly be children of light walking in love.</p>
<p>If we are drunk with God and walk in Him as love and light, we shall have genuine holiness. Real holiness is not a matter of following certain regulations. True holiness is the very God whose children we are and in whom we walk. Hallelujah, we have been born of God, and we are children of light walking in love! We should go on to be filled with God, saturated and permeated with Him, and soaked in Him. This is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.</p>
<p>A real Christian is one who experiences such a dispensing, and the aggregate of all such Christians is the church. The church should be composed of those who are drunk with God, composed of those who are children of light walking daily, hourly, and even moment by moment in love. This is the proper church life. The proper church life is not composed of people who are sober in a natural way. On the contrary, the church is a group of people who are drunk with God. However, although these believers are drunk with the Lord, they are not foolish. Instead, they are wise.</p>
<p>If we are drunk with God through His dispensing, we shall be happy, and we shall rejoice and exult. In this way we shall have the real enjoyment of the processed God in His Divine Trinity in our daily life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>The issue of the divine dispensing is that we can be in subjection to one another in the fear of Christ (v. 21) for the proper Christian life. Verse 21 says, &ldquo;Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.&rdquo; This is a continuation of the preceding verses, which speak of being filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord, and giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and our Father. It is only when we are drunk with God that we are willing to subject ourselves to others. When we are sober, we are clear where others are wrong. We should not be sober in such a way, but we should be drunk with God in our spirit. We should be filled in our spirit with the Triune God. Instead of being filled with wrath, anger, or indignation, we should be filled with all that God is, filled even to the fullness of God. When our spirit is filled with the Triune God who has been dispensed into us, we shall be drunken, not in our body, but in our spirit, not in our outward man, but in our inward man. This kind of drunkenness makes us soft, meek, flexible, and sympathetic. As a result, we are willing to subject ourselves to others.</p>
<p>As long as we have such a subjection among us in the church life, there will not be any problems. The wives will subject themselves to their husbands, even as the church is subject to Christ (vv. 22-24). The husbands will love their wives as Christ loves the church (vv. 25-33). The children will obey their parents in the Lord and honor them (6:1-3). The fathers will not provoke the children but will nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord (6:4). The slaves will obey their masters (6:5-8), and the masters will not threaten the slaves (6:9). How can such a subjection be produced? This subjection is possible only when we are drunk with God. We can be drunk with God only by opening ourselves to the divine dispensing. Let the living water come in to flood you, saturate you, permeate you, and even carry you away. This will cause you to be drunk with the Lord, and it will make you submissive in every situation and to everyone.</p>
<p>Although chapter five is quite long, the extract of this chapter is short and simple. In this extract we have children of light walking in love and filled with the Triune God. Therefore, these children of light are speaking, singing, psalming, thanking, and living a life of subjection to one another.</p>
<p>Eventually, these believers will become the Bride of Christ. In chapter four we have the new man for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose. The new man needs grace and truth. But in chapter five we have a loving Bride for the satisfaction of the Husband. The Bride needs love and light. Hence, grace and truth are for the new man to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, but love and light are for the Bride to satisfy Christ as the Husband.</p>
<p>If we have this view of Ephesians 5, we shall see where the church should be and what the church should be like. The church should be a group of children of light walking in love. Eventually, such a people will become the Bride for the satisfaction of Christ the Husband. All this is through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our being.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
FIGHTING THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:10-24</h1>
<p>In chapter one of Ephesians the divine dispensing issues in the Body of Christ. Eventually, the Body is developed into the full-grown man in chapter four. This full-grown man is the new man with grace and truth for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s purpose. In chapter five the new man is developed into the Bride with love and light. Therefore, by the time we come to chapter five, Christ is expressed through His Body, God&rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled through the new man, and Christ is satisfied with the Bride.</p>
<p>The Body, the new man, and the Bride are all concerned with matters on the positive side. But there is still something on the negative side, a problem that must be dealt with&mdash;God&rsquo;s enemy in this universe. Therefore, in chapter six we have a further development, and the church is seen as a fighter, a warrior. As a warrior, the church is commissioned to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. Eventually, the church will have a full development to be such a warrior.</p>
<p>We have seen that for the new man in chapter four we need grace and truth, and that for the Bride in chapter five we need love and light. In chapter six two further basic elements are introduced in relation to the church as the warrior. These elements are power and the armor of God (6:10-11, 13). Power is inward, and the armor is outward. Inwardly, we are filled with the divine power, the divine dynamo or divine electricity, and outwardly we are clothed with the divine armor. This strengthens and equips us to fight the spiritual warfare for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>The whole book of Ephesians is concerned with divine dispensing for the producing of the Body. Beginning in chapter one, the Body advances, develops, until it attains full growth and becomes the new man to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose and the Bride to satisfy Christ. At this point, all that remains is for the church to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. The church as the warrior must bear the burden to defeat God&rsquo;s enemy by being empowered inwardly and clothed with the armor outwardly. For this reason, in chapter six we have the power and the armor. If we have the power inwardly and the armor outwardly, we shall be strengthened and equipped to fight the battle for God.</p>
<p>Many Christians today do not have the full realization that God needs a warrior, that He needs an army. In his marvelous book, <em>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,</em> John Bunyan likens the individual Christian to a warrior, as revealed in Ephesians 6. This understanding, however, is not accurate. When Bunyan wrote this book three hundred years ago, he did not have the light to see that Ephesians 6 speaks not of an individual warrior, but of a corporate warrior.</p>
<p>Actually, the book of Ephesians is not mainly concerned with individual Christians, but with the corporate church. The Body of Christ is corporate. The new man also is corporate, for it is composed of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. Furthermore, the Bride is a corporate entity, not an individual. In the same principle, the warrior in chapter six must also be corporate. Hence, in Ephesians we have a corporate Body, a corporate new man, a corporate Bride, and a corporate warrior.</p>
<p>We all need to stand in the Body and not stand as individuals. If we stand as individuals, we shall be defeated. If we are detached from the Body, we shall be defeated. My hand is very useful because it is attached to my body. But if it were cut off, detached, it would become useless. This is an illustration of the situation of many Christians today: they are detached from the Body. The vast majority of Christians are detached.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel 37 we have a vision of dry, detached bones in a valley. This is a picture not only of ancient Israel; it is also a picture of the actual situation of today&rsquo;s Christians. Because so many Christians are like dry, detached bones, the Lord needs a recovery. The purpose of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not merely to recover doctrines, but to recover us through life, through the divine breath. We need the divine breath to make us alive. Then in this life we shall be joined, attached, and become one. The main substance we receive through the divine dispensing is life. In the divine life received through the divine dispensing, we are one. Praise the Lord that in His recovery most of the saints are truly attached to one another in the Body. It is a shame for Christians in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to be individualistic. If anyone remains individualistic, his situation will be pitiful. The warrior in Ephesians 6 is altogether a corporate entity.</p><h2 class="head1">EMPOWERED IN THE LORD<br />
AND IN THE MIGHT OF HIS STRENGTH</h2>
<p>In order to fight the battle for God&rsquo;s kingdom and defeat His enemy, we need power. We need divine power, not human power. In Ephesians 6:10 Paul says, &ldquo;Be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may say that this power is a divine dynamo energizing us from within. We may use electricity as an illustration of this power. It would be very foolish for us to turn off the electricity in our homes and try to make electrical appliances operate through our own effort. Since the electricity has already been installed, we simply need to turn on the switch, and then these appliances will be empowered. In a similar way, we should not try to fight the enemy in ourselves or by our own strength. Rather, we need to stay in the Body, where the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; is always on. If we stay in the Body and with the Body, we shall be empowered. But if we do not attend the church meetings or fellowship with the saints, we shall be weakened. If we come to the meetings, we shall be empowered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CLOTHED WITH THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD</h2>
<p>Along with the inward empowering, we need to be clothed outwardly with the armor of God. This armor is wonderful and composed of a number of items: first, the truth to gird our loins; second, righteousness as a breastplate to cover our breast; third, the gospel of peace as shoes to protect our feet; fourth, faith as a shield; fifth, salvation as a helmet to cover our head. When we have all these items of the armor and our head is covered with the helmet of salvation, our entire being will be under this covering, and we shall enjoy full salvation.</p>
<p>The five aspects of the armor we have just mentioned are all defensive. When we have these items, we are fully covered and defended. But we also need something with which to fight. We need an offensive weapon, a sword, the word of God, with which to slay the enemies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Girding Our Loins with Reality</h2>
<p>Let us now consider each item of this armor. We have seen that the first item is truth, or reality, with which we should gird our loins (6:14). According to Ephesians 4, truth refers to God as the reality in our daily life. When we live by God, our daily life will be a life of reality, not a life of vanity. To live in vanity without God implies falsehood and emptiness. Unbelievers who spend their time indulging in worldly entertainments live a life of vanity. There is nothing real in their living. Everything is false, empty. But we who love God and seek Christ should have a daily living that, in a practical way, is filled with God as reality. This means that we should live God. If we live Him, the very God whom we live will be our reality. With Him everything is true and real. With Him, there is no falsehood or emptiness. We need to be girded with such truth, such reality.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother indulges in a certain practice and then hides it from others. This is both falsehood and emptiness. Falsehood and emptiness will cause this brother to be weak, and due to this weakness he may not be able to testify in the meetings for a period of time. He does not have a girdle of truth around his loins; that is, he does not have God as reality in his daily living.</p>
<p>We all need to be girded with truth. If we are girded with truth, with reality, we shall be able to stand up boldly in the meetings and testify as those who are full of vigor.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Covering Our Breast<br />
with the Breastplate of Righteousness</h2>
<p>In 6:14 Paul also speaks of putting on the breastplate of righteousness. When we are girded with truth, the issue will be righteousness. Righteousness comes from truth, which is God as reality. The righteousness that issues out of reality then becomes the breastplate that covers our breast. In figure, the breast signifies the conscience. Hence, the breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience.</p>
<p>The subtle enemy is always accusing us. If we are wrong even in a small matter, he will accuse us. When we are praying, he may accuse us concerning our attitude toward our husband or wife. As a result, we may not be able to continue praying. Furthermore, when we stand up to testify in a meeting, the enemy may accuse us again. If we do not deal with these accusations, we may develop a hole in our conscience, and our faith and peace will leak out. Because of the enemy&rsquo;s constant accusations, we need the breastplate of righteousness. We need to be right with both God and man. However, by ourselves we cannot have this righteousness. But the Bible declares that Christ has become our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>Sometimes we may confess a certain fault to the Lord, or apologize to someone else if necessary, and experience the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood. Nevertheless, Satan still accuses us. Because the fault has been dealt with, this kind of accusation is false. Whenever Satan falsely accuses us, we need to declare, &ldquo;Satan, you point to my mistake, but I point you to Christ. Christ is my righteousness.&rdquo; If we do this, we shall experience Christ as the breastplate of righteousness covering our conscience.</p><h2 class="head2">Having Our Feet Shod with the Firm Foundation<br />
of the Gospel of Peace</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:15 says, &ldquo;And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.&rdquo; When our breast is covered with the breastplate of righteousness, our conscience will be at peace. Peace follows righteousness. Truth produces righteousness, and righteousness produces peace.</p>
<p>Our feet need to be shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace. The words &ldquo;firm foundation&rdquo; indicate a firm footing. When we are fighting against the enemy, we must have a firm footing. We must have something solid on which to stand. If we do not have a firm footing, we shall be weakened and not be able to fight properly. This is the reason soldiers wear strong, heavy boots. Light shoes would not give them a firm foundation. Soldiers need a firm footing.</p>
<p>Our firm foundation, our firm footing, is the gospel of peace. The peace in 6:15 refers to the peace Christ made on the cross when He reconciled the Jews and Gentiles to God. Such a gospel is our peace. It is our peace with God and our peace with one another.</p>
<p>Such a full peace is in the Body. But whenever there is turmoil among believers, there is not a firm foundation for fighting against the enemy. Among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we have people from many different backgrounds and different races. Nevertheless, we have peace with God and with one another. This peace was made by the Lord Jesus. He took away sins and sin, and He nailed to the cross the commandments in ordinances that once separated us from others. Therefore, He has made a full peace for us. Our gospel is the gospel of this peace. The gospel of peace is now our firm footing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking Up the Shield of Faith</h2>
<p>Thus far, we have considered truth, righteousness, and peace. If we have truth, righteousness, and peace, we shall also have faith. Faith is a totality of truth, righteousness, and peace. This faith is a shield which protects our whole being from the flaming darts of the evil one (v. 16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Covering Our Head<br />
with the Helmet of Salvation</h2>
<p>In verse 17 Paul tells us to &ldquo;receive the helmet of salvation.&rdquo; Our head needs to be covered with the helmet of salvation. Truth issues in righteousness, and righteousness produces peace. If we have these three items, we shall have faith. Moreover, we shall also have salvation. When truth, righteousness, peace, and faith are added together, the result is salvation. This salvation is the helmet that covers our head.</p>
<p>All the five items of the armor are Christ. Christ is reality, righteousness, and peace. He is also the Author and Perfecter of faith (Heb. 12:2). This means that faith does not have its source in ourselves but in Christ. Salvation also is Christ. Therefore, the corporate warrior in Ephesians 6 is inwardly empowered with Christ and outwardly clothed with Christ. In other words, this warrior is mingled with Christ. We need Christ empowering us inwardly to be our power, saturating every part of our being. When Christ, the heavenly dynamo, empowers us, He saturates us and makes us vigorous. This is a matter of life-dispensing.</p>
<p>The aggregate of the various aspects of Christ as our armor is the armor of God. The armor of God that covers us is the totality of Christ. Christ is our truth, our reality. Christ is also our righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation. The sum of all these aspects of Christ is the armor of God. When we realize God in Christ as truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation, we have the armor. Therefore, the armor is actually God in Christ realized by us as all these aspects. The power within us is Christ, and the armor outside of us is God realized in Christ. This is altogether related to the divine dispensing of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Once again we may use electricity as an illustration. When you turn on the switch, the electricity works. That working is the dispensing of the electricity. The moving of the current of electricity into the appliances is the dispensing of electricity into them. The Triune God as the heavenly electricity has been installed into us. Whenever the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; is on, the current of the heavenly electricity flows. This flowing is the dispensing of the Triune God to empower us inwardly and to clothe us with the armor outwardly. Through this dispensing the corporate warrior is mingled with the Triune God inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Equipped with the Sword of the Spirit</h2>
<p>God the Son is the power within us, God the Father realized in the Son is the armor upon us, and God the Spirit is the sword, who is the word of God. The fact that the Spirit as the word of God is our sword indicates that we fight by speaking. We all need to learn to speak the word of God. We all need to speak the word and present the truth that we have heard. This speaking of the divine word is the sword that slays the enemy. As a corporate warrior empowered inwardly and covered outwardly, we should now use the sword to fight against God&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6 concludes with the words, &ldquo;Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). These verses indicate that eventually the church will be in such a condition to enjoy peace and love with faith and grace. In chapter one we enjoy grace resulting in peace. Thus, in chapter six we are already in peace. Here we go on to enjoy peace and love with faith plus more grace. This is the result, the issue, of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY FOR<br />
THE SUBJECTIVE SALVATION OF GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10, 17; 8:2-3, 6, 9-11, 14-16, 29-30</h1>
<p>In some recent messages we pointed out that the book of Ephesians is structured with the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Now we need to go on to see this divine dispensing in other books of the New Testament. In this message we shall begin to consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Romans. Although we have given many messages on Romans, in the past we did not emphasize the matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. As we shall see, this matter is revealed in a full and rich way in chapter eight of Romans.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A REVELATION OF GOD&rsquo;S SALVATION</h2>
<p>In chapter one of this book Paul indicates that Romans is concerned with the gospel of God. In 1:1 Paul says that he was &ldquo;separated to the gospel of God,&rdquo; and in 1:16 he says that he is not ashamed of the gospel. The entire book of Romans unfolds the gospel of God in a full way.</p>
<p>In this Epistle we have a revelation of God&rsquo;s salvation from both the objective side and the subjective side. On the objective side, we have redemption, forgiveness of sins, justification, and reconciliation. On the subjective side, we have regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. All the aspects of the subjective side of God&rsquo;s salvation are related to the divine life. We have been regenerated with the divine life, and now we are being sanctified with this life. Simultaneously, we are being transformed with the divine life, and by it we shall eventually be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. Eventually, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, we shall be glorified. We shall be glorified not only with divine power, but also with the divine life.</p>
<p>On the subjective side of God&rsquo;s full salvation the matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is strongly implied. When some hear this, they may point out that the word &ldquo;dispensing&rdquo; is not used anywhere in the book of Romans. This is correct. But the fact of the divine dispensing is found in this Epistle nonetheless. This fact is indicated by the word &ldquo;give&rdquo; in 8:11: &ldquo;But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He Who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit Who indwells you.&rdquo; This verse says that the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead gives life to our mortal bodies. The giving of life is actually the dispensing of the divine life into our being. Therefore, it is right to say that the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is found in the book of Romans.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Objective Side</h2>
<p>The first four and a half chapters of Romans cover the salvation of God from the objective side. Through God&rsquo;s salvation we are justified and reconciled to God. Then beginning from 5:12 and continuing through chapter eight, the book of Romans covers the subjective side of God&rsquo;s salvation. In these chapters we see that we who were once in Adam have been transferred out of Adam into Christ by believing in the Lord Jesus. Therefore, in 6:3 Paul says that we have been &ldquo;baptized into Christ Jesus.&rdquo; We were born into Adam, but we have been baptized into Christ. Now in Christ we enjoy the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Subjective Side</h2>
<p>Romans 5:10 says, &ldquo;For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in His life.&rdquo; In this verse we see both sides of God&rsquo;s salvation, the objective side and the subjective side. Through the death of Christ we have been reconciled to God. This is objective and has already been accomplished. Now that we have been reconciled to God, we shall be saved in Christ&rsquo;s life and by this life. This is the subjective side of God&rsquo;s salvation. Although reconciliation through the death of Christ has been accomplished once for all, to be saved in His life from many negative things is still a daily matter, and it will take place throughout our entire Christian life. Day by day we are being saved by His life. Do you know where this life is? This life is within us.</p>
<p>In 5:17 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For if by the offense of the one death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Life is not only able to save us; it is also able to make us kings reigning over all negative things. For example, in life we can reign over sins, the flesh, the self, and the natural life. We have the power to reign over every negative thing, that is, over everything that is not a positive testimony to God. Hallelujah, we have both the saving life and the reigning life! The life of Christ is this saving and reigning life. As we read Romans 5:10 and 17, we need to pay careful attention to two important phrases: &ldquo;saved in His life&rdquo; (v. 10) and &ldquo;reign in life&rdquo; (v. 17). I would even suggest that you underline these phrases in your Bible.</p>
<p>As we go on from chapters five and six to chapters seven and eight, we are brought on from doctrine to experience. We may not like Romans 7, but this chapter is a bridge joining chapters six and eight. Without the bridge of Romans 7, we shall not have the way into chapter eight.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF THE SAVING AND REIGNING LIFE</h2>
<p>In 8:2 Paul says, &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; The life in 8:2 is the saving life in 5:10 and the reigning life in 5:17. Hence, 8:2 is the direct continuation of 5:10 and 17. The saving and reigning life has a law, and this is the law of the Spirit of life. We may also say that this law is the law of the saving and reigning life. In chapter eight we have the continuation and the development of the saving and reigning life revealed in chapter five. In Romans 8 we have not only the saving and reigning life itself; we have the Spirit and also the law of this life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD AND HIS PROCESS</h2>
<p>As Paul was writing chapter eight of Romans, he had a number of wonderful matters in view. In this chapter he puts these matters together. First, in Romans 8 we have the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Verse 15 speaks of the Father: &ldquo;For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.&rdquo; Verse 3 speaks of the Son: &ldquo;God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; This chapter speaks of the Spirit again and again (vv. 2, 5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 23, 26, and 27). Therefore, in Romans 8 we see the Trinity of the Godhead; that is, we see the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>In this chapter we also see the process through which the Triune God has passed. In verse 3 we have the incarnation, for this verse says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin. This involves incarnation. Second, in Romans 8 the death of Christ is strongly implied. Verse 11 says that God raised Christ Jesus from among the dead. How could the Lord have been resurrected if He had not died? Therefore, here we have incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</p>
<p>In this chapter the resurrection of Christ is revealed in a rich way. This chapter emphasizes the resurrection because it is a chapter on the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of resurrection. We should not try to separate the Spirit from resurrection. Only in the Spirit can we have a full realization of the resurrection of Christ. Romans 8, therefore, is concerned with both the Spirit and resurrection. Because this chapter refers to incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, we may say that it reveals the process through which the Triune God has passed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DESCRIPTION OF OUR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Regenerated Spirit</h2>
<p>In Romans 8 Paul also has much to say regarding our experience. In this chapter he not only speaks of the Spirit of God, but also speaks of our regenerated human spirit. For example, 8:10 says, &ldquo;And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; The spirit in this verse, of course, is our spirit, not the Holy Spirit. Because we have Christ in us, our spirit is life. For this reason, we need continually to turn to our spirit. Whenever you feel that you are weak or tired, you need to turn to your spirit. Are you tempted to lose your temper? Turn to your spirit. We have a part of our being that is life, and this part is our regenerated spirit. No matter how young or new a believer may be in the Lord, the regenerated spirit of that one is life. Praise the Lord that in the New Testament there is a verse that tells us that our spirit is life!</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mind Set on the Spirit</h2>
<p>Romans 8:6 says, &ldquo;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; We have seen from verse 10 that our regenerated spirit is life. Now according to this verse we see that the mind set on the spirit is life. We all know that our mind is troublesome. For example, doubts arise from the mind. All day long we are bothered by our mind. But according to verse 6, even our troublesome mind can be life. In this verse Paul clearly says that the mind set on the spirit is life and also peace. Therefore, our spirit is life, and it is possible for our mind to be life as well.</p>
<p>In 8:6 we see the condition that must be fulfilled if our mind is to be life. This condition, this requirement, is that the mind be set on the spirit. If our mind is set on the flesh, the mind will be death. But if we turn our mind to the spirit and set it on the spirit, our mind will be life and peace. Many of us can testify of this from our experience. For example, suppose you are tempted to be angry with a certain person. If you set your mind on the flesh, surely you will be angry. But if you set your mind on the spirit, your mind will be life. First our spirit becomes life through regeneration. Then by being set on the spirit our mind can also become life.</p><h2 class="head2">Life to Our Mortal Bodies</h2>
<p>As we go on to verse 11, we see that it is also possible for life, the divine, eternal life, to be given to our mortal body. In this verse Paul says that if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will give life to our mortal bodies, and this will take place through the indwelling Spirit. When we put together verses 10, 6, and 11, we see that not only is our spirit life, and our mind life if it is set on the spirit, but life may also be given to our mortal bodies through the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that, as human beings, we are tripartite. This means that we have a spirit, a soul, and a body. In Romans 8 we see that first our spirit becomes life through regeneration. Then if we are faithful to set our mind on our spirit, our mind will also become life. This will open the door and prepare the way for the Spirit to give life to our mortal bodies. As a result, our bodies will receive the divine life.</p>
<p>In Romans 8 we see the Trinity of the Godhead, we see the process through which the Triune God has passed, and we see a clear view of our spiritual experience. The experience of life is threefold; it involves our spirit, our mind, and our body. This indicates that our entire being can become life or receive the supply of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LAW, LEADING, AND SONSHIP</h2>
<p>Chapter eight of Romans also speaks of the law of the Spirit and the leading of the Spirit. In verse 14 Paul says, &ldquo;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; Hence, in this chapter we have the law, the leading, and the sonship.</p>
<p>The central thought of the book of Romans is that God&rsquo;s salvation makes sinners His sons with His life and nature to express Him so that they may become constituents of the Body of Christ for His expression. Hence, sonship is emphasized very much in this chapter. God&rsquo;s salvation is focused on sonship. In His salvation God makes sinners into sons.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONFORMATION AND GLORIFICATION</h2>
<p>In this chapter Paul goes on to speak of conformation and glorification: &ldquo;Because whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He should be the Firstborn among many brothers; and whom He predestinated, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified&rdquo; (vv. 29-30). God has predestinated and justified us, and now He is conforming us, molding us, to the image of His firstborn Son. Eventually, we shall have full glorification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
INTO OUR TRIPARTITE BEING</h2>
<p>May we all be deeply impressed with what is revealed in Romans 8. Here we have the Trinity, the process, and our subjective experience, which involves our spirit, our mind, and our body. In this chapter we also have some marvelous provisions: the law of the Spirit of life, the leading of the Spirit, the sonship, conformation, and glorification. When we put all these matters together, we see the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our tripartite being. The Father sent the Son, and the Son came to accomplish redemption, which consummates in the life-giving Spirit. Praise the Lord for the Trinity and for this wonderful process! This process includes incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Because the Triune God has passed through such a process, we can experience Him. We can have life in our spirit, in our mind, and even in our body. Furthermore, we have the rich provisions of the divine law, the divine leading, the divine sonship, and the divine conformation to mold us into the same image, the image of the firstborn Son of God. Eventually, we shall experience the divine glorification. The aggregate, the totality, of all this is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into the three parts of our being.</p>
<p>In 1979 I gave a message entitled &ldquo;The Life of the Triune God Dispensed into the Tripartite Man&rdquo; (Life-study of Romans Message Sixty-two). In that message, however, I did not place much emphasis on the divine dispensing. My burden in this message is to point out from Romans 8 that we need more and more of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Through this dispensing we are soaked with the Triune God. Just as something may be soaked with water, we need to be soaked with the Triune God. If we would be soaked with the Triune God, we need the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity. Let us all open our whole being to this dispensing so that we may be soaked with the Triune God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:10-17; 8:2-3, 6, 9-11, 14-16, 29-30</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we began to consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the book of Romans. Although the word &ldquo;dispensing&rdquo; is not used in this book, the fact of the divine dispensing is nonetheless found in this Epistle. The fact of dispensing is indicated by the word &ldquo;give&rdquo; in 8:11. We have seen that Romans 8 includes the Divine Trinity, the process through which the Triune God has passed, and our experience of the divine dispensing. This dispensing involves our tripartite being, our spirit, soul, and body. We need to open ourselves to the divine dispensing so that we may be soaked with the Triune God,</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF ROMANS</h2>
<p>The central thought of the book of Romans is that God is producing sons for the formation of the Body of Christ. This book reveals that God is making sinners into sons for the Body. All the members of the Body of Christ are sons of God. If someone has not been regenerated, born again, he is not a child of God, and he is not a member of the Body of Christ. An unregenerated person may be a member of a particular religious group, but he cannot be a member of the living Body of Christ. Christ&rsquo;s Body is living and organic. Only through regeneration can we become the living, organic members of the Body of Christ, which is an organism, not an organization.</p>
<p>We may use dentures as an illustration to show that every member of the Body of Christ must be living and organic. Although a person may wear dentures, they are not an organic part of his body. Because the dentures are not living or organic, they may come out of place. Actually the dentures are a foreign article in the human body. However, every genuine member of a person&rsquo;s physical body is living, organic, and attached to the body. Because the ears are such living members of the body, they do not fall away from the body. In a similar way, we who have been regenerated of the Spirit are not &ldquo;foreign articles&rdquo; in the Body of Christ. We are not &ldquo;dentures&rdquo; that have no life and that are not organic. On the contrary, as members of the Body, we are living and we are organic.</p>
<p>A living person with a body is very different from a robot. A robot may act in a mechanical way, but a person acts in a way that is living and spontaneous because he is full of life and every part of his being is living and organic. In like manner, all the sons of God have the divine life within them. This life makes us the living, organic members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In Romans 8 Paul speaks concerning the sons of God. For example, verse 14 says, &ldquo;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; But in chapter twelve of Romans Paul goes on to speak regarding the Body of Christ. In 12:5 he says, &ldquo;So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.&rdquo; The many sons of God in chapter eight are the many members of the Body of Christ in chapter twelve. The real church is this Body. The living, organic Body of Christ is the church of the living God. This church of the living God is produced by the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>It will be helpful to give some practical illustrations of our need for the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in order to practice the church life. Suppose a group of brothers live together in a brothers&rsquo; house. These brothers will be tested as they live together. The brothers&rsquo; house may be called a house of testing. Suppose one of the brothers realizes that he is doing the dishes much more often than the others are. He begins to complain about the situation. However, when he complains, he has the sense deep within that, in a practical way, he is not in the church life, because the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; within him has been turned off and he is no longer experiencing the divine dispensing. Simply complaining about having to do the dishes so often causes this brother to lose the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. As a result, when the brother comes to the church meeting, he is not able to praise the Lord or even say &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; This is a strong evidence that, in a practical way in his experience, he is not in the church life.</p>
<p>Let us also use married life as an illustration. Suppose a brother is not happy because his wife showed him a &ldquo;long&rdquo; face at home before the meeting. When he comes to the meeting, he is still bothered by what happened at home with his wife. The switch has been turned off within him, and he is not able to pray. This is an evidence that something within him has been disconnected and that in his experience the divine dispensing has been interrupted. This is not a mere teaching or doctrine; it is our actual experience.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE DIVINE TITLES</h2>
<p>According to the divine fact, when we believed in the Lord Jesus, He, the very embodiment of the Triune God, came as the Spirit into our spirit. In 8:9-11 three divine titles are used interchangeably: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ. Hence, Christ is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God. These titles, used interchangeably, are related to the Triune God. Furthermore, all these titles point to the fact that the divine Person now dwells in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Today many Christians pay attention only to objective teachings and not to subjective experience. But in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we care not only for the proper understanding of the Word of God, but we care also for the subjective experience of Christ. If we do not have any subjective experience, then we become nothing as far as the Christian life is concerned, and we are left with nothing except doctrine. We praise the Lord for the experience of the Triune God! Because we have Christ in us, we have the Triune God in us. In 8:10 Paul says, &ldquo;And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; Now this Triune God who dwells in our spirit is dispensing Himself into our whole being. All day long He seeks to dispense Himself into us. Because the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is so intimately related to our daily experience and enjoyment of the Lord, this dispensing is crucial and vital.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STAYING IN THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>Do you know why we need to spend time with the Lord early in the morning? We need to spend time with the Lord in order to have the divine dispensing. However, if we do not care for this dispensing or if we are not aware of its importance, we may waste time in our morning watch caring for other things. As a result, we do not receive any nourishment from the Lord.</p>
<p>During our time with the Lord in the morning, we should set aside our concern about other things and pay attention to the divine dispensing. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, cleanse me once again. This morning I take You as my sin offering and as my trespass offering. Lord, I thank You that Your precious blood cleanses me. My desire is to contact You in my spirit. O Lord Jesus, I love You, I worship You, and I open myself to You. Lord, have a free way in me to saturate me by dispensing Yourself into my being. O Lord, I need Your dispensing all day long.&rdquo; If you pray in this way, you will be watered, nourished, and enlightened. Sometimes you may be rebuked by the Lord, and at other times you may be comforted or strengthened.</p>
<p>This experience does not come merely from learning Bible verses. The watering, nourishing, strengthening, enlightening, comforting, and enriching are the result of the dispensing of the Triune God into your inner being in a practical way. We need this dispensing every morning and throughout the day. Minute by minute, we need to stay in the divine dispensing. It is a serious matter for this inner dispensing to be interrupted. If the divine dispensing ceases, we shall be in a dead and dangerous situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE DISPENSING AND THE LAW OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In 8:2 Paul says, &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; In this verse &ldquo;law&rdquo; does not refer to the Mosaic law or to a particular commandment. Rather, it refers to a principle that operates automatically and spontaneously. Paul had a scientific understanding of the function of the law of the Spirit of life. Just as the law of gravity causes objects to fall back to earth, and just as the law of digestion regulates the digestion of the food we eat, so with the divine life dispensed into us there is a law. This means that the divine dispensing works spontaneously by law, by a principle that functions automatically. Through the working of this law, the essence, the element, and the riches of the divine life are being dispensed into our being.</p>
<p>Apart from the law of life, it is impossible for us to be sanctified or transformed. We cannot be changed metabolically without the law of life. But in the divine life there is an element that works automatically, and by this law we can be sanctified and transformed, that is, metabolically changed. Through the working of this law, we shall also be conformed to the image of Christ and eventually be glorified in His divine element. Doctrine cannot accomplish this. Not even proper biblical doctrine can avail to sanctify us, transform us, conform us to the image of Christ, and glorify us. The only thing that avails to sanctify, transform, conform, and glorify us is the law of the divine life. Praise the Lord that we have such a marvelous law within us! Now it is important that we do not interrupt the working of this divine law. As this divine law operates within us, we shall have the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head1">BREATHING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>What we are speaking about is not anything superstitious. We are talking about a divine fact. Through redemption and by regeneration, we have the Triune God living in our spirit. The Triune God within us is more real than the air we breathe. There is no need for us to fast or cry to the Lord in order to receive the divine dispensing. As we breathe in air to maintain our physical life, we simply need to breathe in the Triune God in order to experience His dispensing. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in Romans 10, the word is near us, in our mouth and in our heart (v. 8). In 10:12 Paul says, &ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; Therefore, we simply need to call on the name of the Lord, and He will be rich to us. The air is available for us all to breathe. By breathing in the air, we are enriched by it. In a similar way, by calling on the name of the Lord, we are enriched by the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATURATED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Because redemption has been accomplished and the blood of Christ has been sprinkled upon the propitiation cover, as believers in Christ we have the Triune God in our spirit. There is no need for us to fast or wait in order to experience Him. We simply need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You for Your provision. I thank You for the blood and for the Spirit. I also thank You, Lord, for being so real within me.&rdquo; When you pray like this, the divine dispensing will take place within you. Through this dispensing you will be saturated with the Triune God, and in this way your whole being will be sanctified. By this dispensing we are soaked with the Triune God. As long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, call on His name, and apply His redeeming blood to our situation, we may experience this divine dispensing.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is not a matter of ethical improvement. Confucius is one who taught people to improve themselves by developing something within them called the bright virtue. But the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is not a matter of improvement, cultivation, or development of a so-called bright virtue. Rather, the Lord&rsquo;s desire is that we enjoy what He has accomplished for us and what He is to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE INDWELLING TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Christ is the processed God. He passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Having passed through this process, He is now in ascension. Furthermore, through His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we may now enjoy what He has accomplished through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and enjoy Him as the life-giving Spirit. This is to enjoy Him as the indwelling Triune God. Hallelujah, the Spirit of God dwells in us! According to Romans 8, the Spirit of Christ and Christ are also in us. It is a fact that, according to 8:11, the Spirit of the One who raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead dwells in our spirit. What a glorious fact this is! Now what do we need to do? We do not need to do anything except enjoy the Lord. Let us enjoy what He has accomplished, what He has obtained, and what He has attained. Let us enjoy all that Christ is. Christ is our redemption and sanctification, our life and life supply. He is our food, our drink, our everything. He is living, rich, and subjective to us. This is the One we experience and enjoy through the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s dispensing we have the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood and the power of His resurrection. In this dispensing we have the element of sanctification, the very substance of the holiness of God. In this dispensing we also have the divine life, the divine love, and the divine light. Through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we have all the divine virtues. How marvelous that these divine virtues are in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit!</p><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord that the life-giving Spirit is now moving in us, acting in us, and anointing us! The anointing of the Spirit may be compared to painting. As coat after coat of paint is applied to a chair, so through the anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit the divine element with the divine essence is applied to us. The Spirit within us is continually anointing us, continually &ldquo;painting&rdquo; us with the divine &ldquo;paint,&rdquo; the divine essence. The Holy Spirit as the ointment is the paint, and this paint includes the divine holiness and all the divine virtues and attributes. The anointing is the moving of this Spirit within us. This anointing is actually the dispensing. Whether we call this anointing or dispensing, this is a matter of the processed Triune God being applied to us in our experience. All we need to do is simply stay under this anointing, stay in this dispensing. Let us stay under the divine dispensing and get soaked with the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>Because our need is to be soaked with the Triune God, we should not make up our mind to improve ourselves. For example, we all have a problem with our temper. Do you think that you are an exception and that you have a good temper instead of a bad temper? The fact is that regarding the problem of temper, we are all the same. Just as frogs have a croaking life and dogs have a barking life, we have a temper-losing life. Do you know why you complain and get angry? You complain and get angry because you have that kind of life. Because we are what we are, we should not make up our minds to be different. A frog cannot stop croaking, a dog cannot stop barking, and we cannot improve our temper. This problem is rooted in our nature. Instead of trying to change your nature, simply receive the divine anointing, the divine dispensing, from the Lord. Keep yourself open to this dispensing. If you continually receive the divine dispensing, it will overcome your temper.</p>
<p>Actually, to overcome our temper or our besetting sins is not in itself a great matter. What is truly a great matter is for us to be saturated with the divine element through the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REAL SANCTIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>This saturation with the divine element through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity is real sanctification and transformation. Eventually, this dispensing will issue in conformation and consummate in glorification. This means that through the divine dispensing we shall be like Christ. Hallelujah, we shall be like Him not only in glory outwardly, but also with the divine element inwardly! We shall be the same as He in element, essence, and substance. This will be the result of being saturated with Him. Year by year and day by day, we need to be soaked with the divine element. This is the experience of the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPREADING ONE</h2>
<p>Romans 8:10 says that because Christ is in us, our spirit is life. According to verse 6, if our mind is set on the spirit, the mind will also become life. Furthermore, according to verse 11, if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us, this One will give life to our mortal body. These verses indicate that the soaking, the saturating, begins with our spirit, spreads to our mind, and eventually reaches our mortal body. Hallelujah, our spirit is life! Our mind can also be life, and our body can receive life.</p>
<p>The dispensing God is also the spreading One. He spreads Himself from our spirit to our mind, and through our mind into our body. Our God is living not only on the throne in the heavens; He is also living in us, in our being. He is spreading Himself into every part of our being and saturating us with Himself until we are fully soaked with all that He is. How glorious! This is God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<p>The goal of God&rsquo;s salvation is to make us sons of God so that we may be the living members of the Body of His Son, Jesus Christ. Hallelujah for the dispensing of the Divine Trinity! Hallelujah for the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ENJOYMENT<br />
OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
AND ITS ISSUE&mdash;THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:2, 14, 16, 23</h1>
<p>Chapter eight of Romans is very rich. We have seen that in this chapter we have the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In this chapter we also have the process through which the Triune God has passed for the purpose of dispensing Himself into us as life and as our life supply. Furthermore, in this chapter we have the divine provisions and the enjoyment of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>Romans 8, of course, is not the conclusion of the book of Romans. We need to go on from chapter eight to chapter twelve, where we see the Body of Christ. Then from chapter twelve we need to go on to chapter sixteen, where we see the church life in a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR STATIONS IN ROMANS</h2>
<p>As a sketch of the Christian life, the book of Romans has four stations. With each of these stations there are four chapters. In the first four chapters we come to the station of justification. Then in chapters five through eight we reach the stage of sanctification. In the third group of four chapters, chapters nine through twelve, we reach the stage of the Body of Christ. Then in the last four chapters, chapters thirteen through sixteen, we have the practical church life. Therefore, the sequence in Romans is justification, sanctification, the Body of Christ, and the church life.</p>
<p>The subject of Romans is the gospel of God. The introduction to this Epistle, 1:1-17, indicates that the gospel of God is the subject of this book. In 1:1 Paul speaks of himself as &ldquo;a slave of Christ Jesus, a called apostle, separated to the gospel of God.&rdquo; In 1:9 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For God is my witness, Whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.&rdquo; Then in 1:15 and 16 he says, &ldquo;So, as far as depends on me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. For I am not ashamed of the gospel.&rdquo; Therefore, the gospel of God is the theme of this Epistle. The entire book of Romans unfolds the gospel, the glad tidings of God, in a full way.</p>
<p>If we would be faithful in preaching the complete gospel of God, we need to preach concerning all four stations in the book of Romans. This means that we should preach justification by faith and sanctification by the Spirit. We should also preach regarding the Body of Christ and the church life. The practical church life is also part of the gospel of God. The important point for us to see is that the book of Romans, which reveals the gospel of God, includes the four stations of justification, sanctification, the Body of Christ, and the local church life.</p>
<p>Many Christians today talk about the Body of Christ. However, they may not know how to reach the Body of Christ revealed in chapter twelve. How can we reach this chapter in order to have the Body? Actually, the answer to this question is not merely a doctrinal matter. In order to reach the Body of Christ, we need to participate in all the divine provisions afforded us in Romans 8. As we have seen already, in this chapter we have not only the Trinity of the Godhead and the process through which the Triune God has passed in order to dispense His riches into our tripartite being, but in this chapter we also have the divine provisions. Let us now consider these provisions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The first of the divine provisions revealed in Romans 8 is the Spirit of life. In 8:2 Paul says, &ldquo;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&rdquo; In this verse the law is not a kind of commandment, such as a commandment of the Mosaic law. Rather, in this verse the law of life is a principle that operates automatically and spontaneously. We may say that in speaking of the law of the Spirit of life, Paul is referring to something that can be compared to a scientific principle. Paul understood that this law of life is a principle that is working in us automatically.</p><h2 class="head2">Natural Law</h2>
<p>Because of the influence of modern scientific studies, it is not difficult for us to understand what a natural law is. For example, we may speak of the law of digestion. The food we eat is digested according to this law. What do we mean by a natural law? A natural law is an automatic, spontaneous action that is caused by a natural power or strength. After we eat a meal, there is no need for us to work consciously at digesting the food, for a particular law in our body spontaneously works to cause the food to be digested. This is the law of digestion. After the food we eat passes into our stomach, this law begins to work. Through the working of this law, our food is digested automatically. This law of digestion is an illustration of what Paul means by law in 8:2.</p>
<p>We may also use fruit trees to illustrate the meaning of law in 8:2. A peach tree produces peaches according to the natural law of a peach tree. Therefore, there is no reason to order a peach tree to bear peaches and not apples. No one would be so foolish as to say to a peach tree, &ldquo;Peach tree, I would remind you that I want you to produce peaches and not apples. You must produce peaches for me this year.&rdquo; A peach tree will automatically produce peaches according to the natural law of a peach tree.</p>
<p>The peach-tree law will also determine the shape of the peaches produced by a peach tree. The peaches will all be somewhat round in shape and not cubical. Have you ever seen a peach tree that bore peaches with the shape of a cube? A peach tree would never produce fruit with such a shape, because that would be contrary to the law of a peach tree. Because the peach-tree law shapes the fruit into a certain form, there is no need for us to say, &ldquo;Peach tree, do not produce fruit in the form of a cube. I want all the fruit you produce to be round. To help you, I will place a model in front of you. Now I want you to shape all the peaches into a round form like this model.&rdquo; How ridiculous it would be for anyone to give such instructions to a peach tree! The fruit produced by a peach tree is shaped according to the natural law of the peach tree. A peach tree automatically will produce fruit that is round and not cubical.</p>
<p>With every kind of living thing, whether plant or animal, there is a law. This means that wherever there is a certain life, there will be a certain law. Actually, the life is the law. For example, a dog has the natural law of the dog life, and a cat has the law of the cat life. The principle is the same with human life. Therefore, in the natural life of a human being there is the law of human life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Highest Life</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord that through regeneration we have received the highest life! This life is eternal life, the divine, uncreated life. This life is nothing less than the very life of God. Because we have been born of God, we have received the life of God. Hallelujah for the divine birth that gives us the divine life!</p>
<p>As those who believe in Christ, we all have had two births: the human birth and the divine birth. First, we were born of our parents. Then at the time of our conversion, we believed in the Lord Jesus and had another birth. This means that we were born of God. John 1:12 and 13 say, &ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; These verses tell us clearly that we have been born of God to be children of God.</p>
<p>In his first Epistle John also refers a number of times to the divine birth. For example, in 1 John 3:9 he says, &ldquo;Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.&rdquo; In 1 John 4:7 he says, &ldquo;Everyone who loves has been begotten of God.&rdquo; Then in chapter five of his Epistle John says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God&rdquo; (v. 1); &ldquo;Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world&rdquo; (v. 4); and &ldquo;Everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, but he who is begotten of God keeps himself&rdquo; (v. 18). From these verses we can see clearly that we who believe in Christ have been born of God. We have experienced the divine birth, and through this divine birth we have received the divine life, the highest life.</p>
<p>We know that animal life is higher than plant life and that human life is higher than animal life. Now we need to see that the divine life is higher than human life. Because the divine life is the highest life, its law is the highest and most prevailing law. Praise the Lord that the highest life with the highest law is within us!</p><h2 class="head2">Operating by Growing</h2>
<p>Because the highest law, the law of the divine life, is operating within us, there is no need for us to strive to overcome negative things. Instead of striving, we should simply allow the law of life to work within us. However, we need to see that this law works only as the divine life grows.</p>
<p>Let us once again use a peach tree as an illustration. If for some reason a peach tree is not allowed to grow, the law of the peach tree will not work. But if the peach tree is watered and fertilized, it will grow, and as it grows, the law within it will work spontaneously. Through the working of the peach-tree law, the tree will automatically produce peaches.</p>
<p>The principle is the same with the working of the highest law, the law of the Spirit of life. The essence of this law is the Holy Spirit and the divine life. It is not the law of letters; it is the law of the Spirit. Likewise, it is not the law of knowledge; it is the law of life. Hence, this law is the law of the Spirit of life. Although this law is now within us, the operation of this law depends upon the growth of the divine life. How marvelous that we have such a law as the first of the divine provisions revealed in Romans 8!</p>
<p>Many of us who were Christians for years before we came into the church life in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can testify that we never heard that in the New Testament there is a law called the law of the Spirit of life and that this law is working within us. We need proper teaching regarding this law working in us. Furthermore, we need an unveiling, a disclosure, of the fact that within us as Christians there is such a divine, profound, and mysterious law.</p>
<p>If we had only doctrine and teachings and not the experience of the law of the Spirit of life working in us, then to us God&rsquo;s salvation would become a religion or a system of ethics similar to the ethical teachings of Confucius. Confucius could teach ethics, but he could not impart into others the law of the Spirit of life. What we need is not ethical teachings, but the inward working of this divine law. Husbandmen and gardeners know that it is not necessary to teach plants and trees to grow. Living plants do not take &ldquo;classes&rdquo; and then after a period of time have a &ldquo;graduation.&rdquo; Instead of teaching plants and trees, gardeners fertilize them, water them, and kill the bugs that destroy them. Gardeners do anything necessary to protect the trees and help them grow. Then as the plants and trees grow, the law within them will work automatically.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Divine Provision</h2>
<p>When I came to this country, I began to tell the Lord&rsquo;s people that we need the living Christ, not doctrine or theology. We need the divine life, and in this life there is the divine law. Our need today is not for more doctrine; our need is for the marvelous divine provision of the law of life. May we all realize that we have this divine law within us.</p>
<p>We can understand more concerning the working of the law of the divine life by considering how the natural law of the human life works in a baby. There is no need, for example, to teach an infant not to eat things that taste bitter. If something bitter is placed into a baby&rsquo;s mouth, the baby will automatically try to spit it out. However, the baby will spontaneously drink what is pleasing to the taste. In either case, there is no need for teaching, for the human life in the baby operates automatically according to its law. In the physical life of a child is the law of human life. As soon as a child is born, this law begins to operate. The principle is the same with the divine life that we received through regeneration.</p>
<p>We have emphasized the fact that in the divine life there is a divine law and that this law works automatically. Suppose someone repents and believes in the Lord Jesus. The next day he may begin to realize that there is something living within him that does not agree with certain things. This new believer has not been taught to refrain from those things. But through regeneration he has received the divine life with the divine law, and this law is now working within him. As a result of the working of the divine law, this new believer has the feeling that he should no longer do certain things. This is the operation of the law of life on the negative side. On the positive side, this new believer can now receive the rich provisions of the divine life to live the Christian life. The law of life is the first provision in the divine life for us to live a proper daily Christian life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LEADING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Paul speaks of a second divine provision in 8:14: &ldquo;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.&rdquo; In this verse we have the leading of the Spirit. Some Christians have received inaccurate teachings concerning the leading of the Spirit. They may think that in order to have the Spirit&rsquo;s leading they need to follow a certain procedure. However, the genuine leading of the Spirit is within our spirit. This means that in our spirit there is a divine provision called the leading of the Spirit. A divine Person, the Spirit of God, indwells us, and this indwelling Spirit is now leading us.</p>
<p>Suppose a young brother is considering what to do on the weekend. He may desire to engage in a certain kind of worldly amusement. But within him there is Someone&mdash;the Spirit&mdash;leading him, and this One does not agree with that desire. As a result, there is a struggle within this young brother, a struggle between his own desire and the leading of the Spirit. Although he cannot see the invisible Spirit, he can sense the Spirit&rsquo;s leading within him. I would even say that he can sense not only the Spirit&rsquo;s leading, but also the Spirit Himself. Deep within, this brother may sense the Spirit saying, &ldquo;You want to do that thing, but I don&rsquo;t agree with you. You should go to the church meetings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that we have a Leader in us, and this Leader is the Spirit! Because we have the indwelling Spirit leading us, we are not under the control of some powerful person who exerts a strong influence upon us. No, we have a divine Leader, the Spirit who dwells in our spirit, leading us day by day.</p>
<p>Many of us can testify that we experience the leading of the Spirit even in such a small matter as a haircut. In our church life we do not have a regulation which says that the brothers should have their hair cut in a certain way. Instead of regulations, we have the indwelling Spirit leading us. Suppose a young brother wants to have his hair cut in a particular way, but the leading Spirit within him does not agree. The brother wants to keep his hair rather long, but the Spirit prefers that it be cut short. If this brother does not care for the Spirit&rsquo;s leading and offends Him, he will have no joy within him. He will not be able to sing that song concerning being happy in the splendid church life. However, if he has his hair cut according to the leading of the indwelling Spirit, he will have joy. When he comes out of the barbershop, he may find himself singing about the splendid church life. This is the result of following the leading of the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>How can we know that we are sons of God? We know that we are sons of God because we are led by the Spirit. This leading is not accidental or occasional. Rather, the leading of the Spirit should be habitual, constant. Continuously in our daily life we should be led by the divine Indweller. If we are led by the Spirit all day long, then we are living as sons of God. This means that we not only are sons of God, but we are actually living as sons of God in a practical way.</p>
<p>If a brother needs to get a haircut, there is no need for him to pray for the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. This brother does not need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I&rsquo;m going to the barbershop to get a haircut. How long should my hair be? Lord, show me the right length for my hair.&rdquo; Instead of praying like this, the brother should simply go to the barbershop according to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. Because he has the leading of the indwelling Spirit, he will know spontaneously how he should have his hair cut. Have you not had similar experiences? We not only have the law of the Spirit of life within us&mdash;we also have the leading of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WITNESS OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This leading One is also the witnessing One. Romans 8:16 says, &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo; There is a Witness within us who testifies that we are children of God. This means that within us Someone is reminding us that we are children of God. Sometimes this reminding One regulates us or safeguards us. This regulating comes from a living Person, the Spirit, who is witnessing with our spirit.</p>
<p>Often we have exercised our mind to try to figure out certain things related to our Christian life. We know from experience that this is a distraction. What we need is the living witness of the Spirit. According to 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, not with our mind. Paul says clearly and explicitly that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. However, the human spirit is neglected by most Christians.</p>
<p>Let me tell you how a certain sister experienced the Spirit witnessing with her spirit that she is a child of God. This sister went into a restaurant and ordered two hamburgers. But the one serving her charged her for only one. Within this sister was a reminder that she is a child of God. The sister was thinking that perhaps others would laugh at her if she said that she was charged for one hamburger instead of two. But as she was considering what to do, she continued to sense the Spirit reminding her that she is a child of God. Therefore, she told the person who sold her the hamburgers, &ldquo;I am a child of God, and I need to pay you for the second hamburger.&rdquo; I believe that many of us have had similar experiences of the Spirit witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God. This is also a divine provision.</p>
<p>Thus far we have seen from Romans 8 that we have three divine provisions: the law of the Spirit of life (v. 2), the leading of the Spirit (v. 14), and the witness of the Spirit (v. 16). Now in verse 23 we see another divine provision&mdash;the firstfruit of the Spirit. The word &ldquo;firstfruit&rdquo; here refers to a foretaste that is a guarantee that we shall experience the full taste. God Himself is the full taste, and He has given us His Spirit as the firstfruit to be our foretaste. This means that within us we have the Spirit of God for our enjoyment, and this enjoyment is the foretaste and guarantee that we shall have the full taste. This is the guarantee that at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back we shall enjoy God in full. Praise the Lord that we have the Spirit within us as the foretaste!</p>
<p>In chapter eight of Romans we see the wonderful divine provisions. We have the divine law, the leading of the Spirit, the witness of the Spirit, and the Spirit as the foretaste for the coming full taste. The Triune God has afforded us these rich, divine provisions.</p>
<p>Every aspect of the divine provisions is actually the processed Triune God who is now within us. The law of the Spirit of life, the leading of the Spirit, the witnessing of the Spirit, and the Spirit as the foretaste are all the processed Triune God. After passing through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, our God has become the Spirit dwelling within us. Now in this Spirit we have the law, the leading, the witnessing, and the foretaste. Praise the Lord for these provisions!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ENJOYMENT<br />
OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
AND ITS ISSUE&mdash;THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4-6, 13; 12:1-2, 5, 11; 16:1, 5a, 16b, 20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In Romans 8:4 Paul says, &ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the word &ldquo;walk&rdquo; means to live, move, and have our being. This word indicates that we should do everything in spirit. This is to have our being and our daily life according to spirit.</p>
<p>Bible translators realize that it is difficult to determine whether the spirit in 8:4, as well as in other verses in Romans 8, refers to the Holy Spirit or our human spirit. Of course, in certain verses, such as 8:9 and 16, the Holy Spirit and the human spirit are clearly designated. In 8:4 the spirit refers to our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God. Actually, these two spirits have become one. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6:17, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We have such a wonderful mingled spirit, our human spirit regenerated by the divine Spirit and indwelt by the divine Spirit. In the New Testament we are charged to live, walk, and have our being according to this mingled spirit.</p>
<p>Recently I gave a message in Chinese entitled &ldquo;Walk According to Spirit.&rdquo; In that message I pointed out that we need to do everything according to the spirit. If we truly live according to spirit, we shall not lose our temper, argue with our husband or wife, gossip, or murmur. I can testify that when I live according to spirit, I cannot argue. Whatever we do, we should do according to spirit. We should dress ourselves according to spirit and also have our hair cut according to spirit.</p>
<p>In His wisdom the Lord caused the Apostle Paul to tell us that if we walk according to spirit, the righteous requirement of the law will be fulfilled in us. Instead of hundreds of commandments, Paul gives us a unique commandment&mdash;to live, walk, and have our being according to spirit. Suppose, for example, that you are tempted to lose your temper. Instead of trying to suppress your temper, simply live and walk according to spirit. This means that instead of trying to deal with your temper, you should live according to spirit. If you walk according to spirit, the &ldquo;gopher&rdquo; of your temper will be dealt with automatically. This means that the problem of your temper will be solved, not by your effort, but as the result of your living according to spirit.</p>
<p>By walking according to spirit, we shall keep ourselves under the &ldquo;shower&rdquo; of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. However, if we do not walk according to spirit, we shall move away from the shower of the divine dispensing. The more we walk according to spirit, the more we remain under the dispensing of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SETTING THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In 8:6 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.&rdquo; We know from experience that our mind is unruly. Within a short period of time, our thoughts can travel around the world. Sometimes this happens while we are sitting in a prayer meeting. As the meeting is going on, in our mind we may travel from place to place and imagine all sorts of things. Therefore, we surely need to set our mind upon the spirit.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that we can set our mind on our regenerated spirit! Our spirit is no longer dead, for it has been enlivened by the Holy Spirit. In 8:10 Paul tells us that our spirit is life. Our regenerated and enlivened spirit is indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Now we need to set our mind upon this mingled spirit. In 2 Timothy 1:7 Paul says, &ldquo;For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.&rdquo; Continually we need to turn our mind to the spirit and set our mind upon the spirit.</p>
<p>I can testify that it is a great protection for us to set our mind on our regenerated spirit. This will also help us to keep ourselves under the shower of the divine dispensing, and it will enable us to be victorious in our daily living. By setting our mind upon the spirit, we enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>We should not take the matters of walking according to spirit and setting our mind on the spirit merely as doctrine. As points of doctrine, these do not mean very much. We need to put these matters into practice in our daily living.</p><h2 class="head1">PUTTING TO DEATH THE PRACTICES OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>If we walk according to spirit and set our mind upon the spirit, then spontaneously we shall by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body. Concerning this, Paul says, &ldquo;For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live&rdquo; (v. 13). If we live, walk, and have our being according to spirit and set our mind on the spirit, then continually we shall by the Spirit put to death all the practices of the body. Then we shall be absolutely under the divine dispensing, and we shall participate in this rich dispensing and enjoy it. Furthermore, if we walk according to spirit, set our mind on the spirit, and put to death the activities of the body by the Spirit, we shall automatically be in the Body in a practical way.</p>
<p>In chapter eight of Romans Paul says that our spirit is life, that the mind set on the spirit is life, and that life may be supplied to our mortal bodies (vv. 10, 6, 11). Then in chapter twelve Paul goes on to speak again concerning the spirit, the mind, and the body. First he speaks of the body, then of the mind, and then of the spirit. In 12:1 Paul says, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.&rdquo; Here Paul speaks about the presenting of the body. In verse 2 he goes on to speak concerning the mind: &ldquo;And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may prove by testing what the will of God is, that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect.&rdquo; In this verse Paul speaks of the renewing of the mind. In verse 11 he says, &ldquo;Not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave.&rdquo; Therefore, in Romans 12 we have a presented body, a renewed mind, and a burning spirit. By this we can see a link between chapters eight and twelve. In both chapters we have the body, the mind, and the spirit worked upon by the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>If we do not by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body, how could our body ever be presented to the Lord for the Body life? This would be impossible. In order to have our body presented to God for the Body of Christ, we need to put to death the practices of the body. The reason this putting to death is necessary is that our body is occupied by many different kinds of practices. For example, a young brother may stay away from the church meetings for a few weeks. When he returns to the meetings, he may claim that in the past weeks he has been too busy to attend the meetings. Actually, this brother has been busy with certain practices that have kept him away from the meetings. He has had time to do what he wanted to do, but he did not have time to come to the meetings.</p>
<p>Let us use as a very practical illustration the matter of talking on the telephone. When some sisters begin talking on the telephone, they go on and on, talking perhaps for more than an hour. Although they have the time to talk on the telephone, they may tell you that they do not have the time to pray or to come to the church meetings. Therefore, the practice of talking too long on the telephone must be put to death. When you are tempted to talk unnecessarily, by the Spirit you need to put to death that practice of the body. This will save you a great deal of time, and it will also make it possible for your body to be presented to the Lord for His Body.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that if our body is occupied by certain practices, it cannot be presented to the Lord. A young sister may spend much time in front of the mirror dressing herself, but she may say that she does not have the time to read the Bible. A brother may spend much time reading a newspaper and yet claim that he does not have time for the church life. I hope that through these illustrations we shall see that if we do not put to death the practices of the body, we shall not be able to present our body for the church life. Our body must be emancipated from all different kinds of practices.</p>
<p>But how can our body be emancipated? The only way for the body to be emancipated is for us to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body. Only then will we have time and will our body be presented to the Lord for His Body. Therefore, the body must first be set free from various practices, and then it can be presented to the Lord according to Paul&rsquo;s word in 12:1.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
ISSUING IN THE BODY LIFE</h2>
<p>In both 8:6 and 12:2 Paul speaks concerning the mind. In 12:2 he tells us that we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind. But if our mind is not set on the spirit, it cannot be renewed. The renewing of the mind results from setting the mind on the spirit. Therefore, the mind set on the spirit in 8:6 becomes the renewed mind in 12:2. Our mind can be renewed only by its being set on the spirit.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word concerning the body and the mind in chapters eight and twelve links these chapters. The same is true about what he says concerning our spirit. In 12:11 he exhorts us to be burning in spirit. But if our spirit has not been made alive, it cannot be burning. Only when life is prevailing in our spirit can we be burning in spirit.</p>
<p>The fact that Paul&rsquo;s word concerning the body, the mind, and the spirit in chapters eight and twelve links these chapters, indicates that the enjoyment of the divine dispensing in chapter eight issues in the Body life in chapter twelve. This matter is very experiential. If we do not have the adequate experience of what is revealed in chapter eight and do not enjoy the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into the three parts of our being, we shall not realize the Body of Christ. Rather, the teaching concerning the Body would merely be a doctrine to us, and our talk regarding the Body would be vain. But when we experience and enjoy the divine dispensing in Romans 8, this experience and enjoyment issues in the realization of the Body life in chapter twelve. When I enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity, I aspire to be in the Body. The enjoyment of the divine dispensing makes me a living member of the Body of Christ in a practical way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOCAL CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>We know that Paul did not conclude the Epistle to the Romans with chapter twelve, but went on until he came to chapter sixteen. This chapter contains Paul&rsquo;s greetings. When I was young, I did not care for this chapter of greetings. However, in recent years I have seen that this chapter is not merely a list of greetings; this chapter is on the local church life. In verse 1 Paul mentions the church in Cenchrea. In verse 4 Paul refers to &ldquo;all the churches of the nations,&rdquo; and in verse 5, to the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila. Then in verse 16 he says, &ldquo;The churches of Christ greet you.&rdquo; As I considered these verses, I realized that the greetings in this chapter were given in the sphere of the church life. This is a strong indication that if we are serious with the Lord concerning the Christian life, we need to come to the point of having the church life in a practical way. The church life is part of the full gospel revealed in the book of Romans.</p>
<p>In the first two and a half chapters of Romans, we see that we were sinners. But according to the second part of chapter three, all of chapter four, and the first part of chapter five, we have been justified and reconciled to God. Following this we see, in the second part of chapter five and in chapters six through eight, that in Christ we are being sanctified. We have pointed out that in chapter eight we enjoy the divine dispensing, the dispensing of the divine life into our tripartite being as our supply. It is by this dispensing that we are sanctified, transformed, and made living members of the Body of Christ in chapter twelve. After writing about all this, Paul brings us to the local church life portrayed in chapter sixteen.</p>
<p>Wherever we may be, we should participate in the church life in our locality. It is here in the local church life that Satan, the Devil, will be crushed beneath our feet. Therefore, in 16:20 Paul says, &ldquo;Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you. Amen.&rdquo; From experience we know that when we live in the church life, Satan is crushed under our feet, and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with us. Therefore, in the church life we have the crushing of Satan and the enjoyment of grace. All this is included in the gospel of God.</p>
<p>The full salvation of God&rsquo;s complete gospel includes the church life. Not only does this salvation include justification, sanctification, and the Body in a doctrinal way; it also includes the church life in a practical way. The Body of Christ can be practical to us only through the genuine practice of the local church life. If we are not in a local church, how can we be in the Body of Christ in a practical way? Apart from the church life, the teaching concerning the Body is theory. Unless we are in the church life in a practical way, our talk concerning the Body will be vain.</p>
<p>Here in the church life not only do we have all the experiences described in chapters one through twelve, but here Satan is crushed under our feet, and we enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord that the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issues in the genuine Body life practiced in the local churches!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE PRACTICAL LIFE IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2, 24, 30; 2:7, 9-10, 12; 3:16; 6:11b</h1>
<p>Many Christians think that the book of Romans is deeper than the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians. In a sense, Romans is deeper than 1 and 2 Corinthians. But as far as the church life is concerned, these two Epistles are deeper than Romans, for they are more practical. Of the fourteen Epistles of Paul, the most practical Epistles are the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians.</p>
<p>Whenever we touch the practical aspect of the church life, we have trouble. If we stay in the realm of doctrine or if we approach the church in a theoretical way, everything may seem to be fine. But when we come to the practicality of the church, we face difficulties. In 1 and 2 Corinthians there are many troubles, but Paul gives us the remedy for all these troubles. For this reason, in these books the depths of God are revealed in a practical way.</p>
<p>In these messages on 1 and 2 Corinthians we shall consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. I believe that the expression &ldquo;divine dispensing&rdquo; was originated by us. The divine dispensing certainly is not a matter of doctrine; on the contrary, the divine dispensing is a matter of the depths of God realized in a practical way.</p>
<p>As the title of this message indicates, according to 1 Corinthians, the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issues in the practical life of a local church and in a local church. Therefore, as we consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in this Epistle, we come to something very practical, and this practical matter is the life of a local church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS GOD&rsquo;S POEM</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 2:10 Paul says, &ldquo;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God before prepared that we should walk in them.&rdquo; The Greek word for &ldquo;workmanship&rdquo; here is <em>poiema,</em> which can also be translated masterpiece. This Greek word means something which has been made, a handiwork, or something which has been written or composed as a poem. Not only poetic writing, but also any work of art that expresses the maker&rsquo;s wisdom and design is a poem. We, the church, the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are also a poem, expressing God&rsquo;s infinite wisdom and divine design.</p>
<p>As a poem written, composed, by God, the church is God&rsquo;s masterpiece created in Christ Jesus. To create is to call something not being as being; that is, to create is to call something into existence. Anything that is created is altogether new. Because the church has been created in Christ Jesus, the church is a new creation. We, the church, as the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, are an absolutely new item in the universe, an item freshly brought forth by God. We have been created by God in Christ through regeneration to be His new creation (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>Since the church is a new creation, we are not the church when we live in our old nature or by the old creation. The church is something absolutely new, something created of God by His Spirit in Christ. Therefore, the Trinity&mdash;God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit&mdash;is involved in the producing of the church. Actually, the church is produced through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. This means that the church is a new creation produced through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Because the church is of God, by the Spirit, and in Christ, it is God&rsquo;s masterpiece, His poem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE ALPHABET<br />
FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>What are the letters with which the church as God&rsquo;s poem is composed? What is the alphabet used in writing this poem? In the last book of the New Testament, the book of Revelation, we see that the Triune God is Himself this alphabet. Revelation 1:8 says, &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.&rdquo; Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, and Omega is the last letter. Not only is God the first and last letter of the alphabet; He is also the other letters, all the letters between Alpha and Omega. Therefore, He is the letters used to make up the words that compose this poem. Just as all poetry is composed of words written with letters of the alphabet, so the church as God&rsquo;s poem is composed of God Himself as the letters.</p>
<p>We have seen that in Revelation 1:8 the Lord God declares that He is the Alpha and the Omega. But in Revelation 22:13 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the end.&rdquo; Does this mean that there are two sets of letters, one related to God and the other to the Lord Jesus? No, these verses indicate that God and the Lord Jesus are one. In the first chapter of Revelation God declares that He is the Alpha and the Omega, and then in the last chapter of Revelation the Lord Jesus makes the same declaration concerning Himself. This indicates that the entire Godhead is the divine alphabet. Our Triune God is the whole alphabet: the Alpha, the Beta, the Gamma, the Delta, and all the letters through Omega. Actually, the New Testament is not composed of the letters of the Greek alphabet. The entire New Testament is composed of the letters in the divine and heavenly alphabet, letters which are actually the Triune God Himself.</p>
<p>I can testify that for more than sixty years I have been learning to compose something with the Triune God as letters. I have become accustomed to using these heavenly letters. I would encourage all of you to learn to write with these letters, realizing that the New Testament actually is composed of God Himself. The Triune God is every letter of the alphabet used in writing the New Testament.</p>
<p>Some readers may be wondering what it means to compose something with the Triune God as the letters of the alphabet. Perhaps I may use as an illustration a recent experience in ministering the Word of God. Not long ago I gave some messages on the basic revelation in the holy Scriptures. In those messages I spoke concerning God&rsquo;s plan, Christ&rsquo;s redemption (including His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension), the Spirit&rsquo;s application, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation. In giving all those messages I applied the Triune God as the letters of the spiritual alphabet. Every aspect of the church as God&rsquo;s poem is composed with the Triune God as the alphabet.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXISTENCE OF THE CHURCH THROUGH<br />
THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<p>I do not believe that throughout the centuries many Christians have realized that the existence of the church depends on the divine dispensing. The church does not come into being through organization. The church comes into being through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The dispensing of the Triune God, therefore, gives the church its existence.</p>
<p>The church comes into being through the divine dispensing of what the Triune God is. When the Divine Trinity is dispensed into the believers, this dispensing brings the church into existence. We all need to know the church in such a deep way. We need to know that the church does not come into existence through anything other than the dispensing of the Triune God into the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Produced of God as the Source</h2>
<p>The church is produced of God as the source. This is the reason 1 Corinthians 1:2 speaks of &ldquo;the church of God which is in Corinth.&rdquo; Here we see that the church to which this Epistle was addressed was of God and in Corinth. If we had been writing this Epistle, we might have said simply &ldquo;to the church which is in Corinth.&rdquo; However, Paul first says that the church is of God and then that it is in Corinth.</p>
<p>Here we see that the church is both divine and local; it is a church that is of God and also a local church, a church of God and a church in Corinth. The church addressed in this Epistle is a local church, a church in a city, not the church in a region or a street. &ldquo;Of God&rdquo; indicates the source of the church, and &ldquo;in Corinth&rdquo; indicates the location of the church.</p>
<p>The church in Corinth was constituted of the universal God, but it existed in Corinth, a definite locality on earth. In nature the church is universal in God, but in practice the church is local in a definite place. Hence, the church has two aspects: the universal and the local. Without the universal aspect, the church is void of content; without the local aspect, it is impossible for the church to have any expression or practice. Therefore, the New Testament also emphasizes the local aspect of the church (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11).</p>
<p>Let us read all of 1 Corinthians 1:2: &ldquo;To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.&rdquo; Here we see that &ldquo;the church of God&rdquo; equals &ldquo;those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; This strongly indicates that the church is a composition of the saints, and the saints are the constituents of the church. The two should not be considered separate entities. Individually, we are the saints; corporately, we are the church.</p>
<p>We have seen that in 1:2 &ldquo;of God&rdquo; indicates the source and &ldquo;in Corinth&rdquo; indicates the location. In this verse we also have the phrase &ldquo;in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; As we shall see, this means in the element and sphere of Christ. Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.</p>
<p>According to verse 2, the members of the church are called saints. We need to lay aside the Roman Catholic concept of a saint and be impressed with the fact that we all are saints, genuine saints sanctified in Christ Jesus. We have been made holy, separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose. In verse 2 Paul does not say, as rendered in the King James Version, that the believers are called to be saints; rather, he says that the believers in Christ are the called saints. This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition.</p>
<p>In 1:2 the preposition &ldquo;with&rdquo; is significant. Paul does not say &ldquo;<em>and</em> all those who call,&rdquo; but says &ldquo;<em>with</em> all those who call.&rdquo; This indicates that a local church, such as the church in Corinth, is composed only of those believers in that locality, not of all believers in every place. It also indicates that this Epistle was intended not only for the believers in the church in Corinth, but for all believers in every place. Hence, this Epistle is for all believers of whatever place or time.</p>
<p>In this verse Paul speaks of calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. To call upon the name of the Lord implies believing in Him (Rom. 10:14). All believers in the Lord should be those who call on Him (Acts 9:14, 21; 22:16). We have been called to call; we have been called by God to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;theirs and ours&rdquo; used by Paul in 1:2 indicate that Christ, as the all-inclusive One, belongs to all believers. He is our portion given to us by God (Col. 1:12). The apostle added this special phrase at the end of this verse to emphasize the crucial fact of Christ&rsquo;s being the unique center of all believers in whatever place or situation. For all problems, especially the matter of division, the only solution is the all-inclusive Christ. We have all been called into the fellowship, the participation, in Him (1 Cor. 1:9).</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:2 is a rich verse. All the riches contained in this verse are related to the church.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that, according to 1:2, the church is of God. This phrase not only denotes the fact that the church belongs to God, but it also indicates that the source of the church is God Himself. The church comes out from God. Since the church comes out from God, the church is of God.</p>
<p>As an illustration of the fact that the church comes out from God, we may say that children are of their parents. This means that children are the issue, the produce, that comes out from their parents. In a similar way, the church is the produce that comes out from God, for all the members of the church have been born of God.</p>
<p>We all have been born of God; that is, we all have experienced the divine birth. It is through the divine birth that the church comes into being. Just as there cannot be a human family without human birth, so there cannot be a church, which is a divine family, without the divine birth. A family is something that issues from human parents through birth. Likewise, the church is of God and issues from God through the divine birth.</p>
<p>The begetting of children is a matter of dispensing. When parents beget children, they dispense their life and nature into the children. Hence, birth is actually a dispensing. We have been born of God, and our divine birth involved the divine dispensing. Actually, the divine dispensing began at the time of our regeneration.</p>
<p>How can the church be produced? How can the church come into existence? The existence of the church depends on the divine birth. Through the divine birth God has dispensed Himself into our being. That part of our being which has received the divine dispensing is part of the church. When we were regenerated, we all received the dispensing of the Triune God into our being. The church is composed of that part in the believers which has received the divine dispensing. When we add all these parts together, the total is the church.</p>
<p>The church is of God because the church is produced with the element that comes out from God. For the Corinthians, the church was also in Corinth. This church was composed of all the sanctified ones with those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, all those who possess this all-inclusive One. As we consider the points in 1:2, we see that the church is the issue of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE PRACTICAL LIFE IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2, 24, 30; 2:7, 9-10, 12; 3:16; 6:11b</h1>
<p>In the foregoing message we began to consider Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 1:2: &ldquo;To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.&rdquo; We have seen that for the church to be of God means not only that the church belongs to God, but also that the church comes out from God as the source. We have also seen that the existence of the church comes through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. In particular, the church is produced of God as the source. In this message we shall go on to consider the church sanctified in Christ as the sphere and element and also sanctified by the spirit as the application with the divine nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sanctified in Christ<br />
as the Sphere and Element</h2>
<p>In 1:2 Paul speaks of those who have been &ldquo;sanctified in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; To be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be sanctified in the element and sphere of Christ. Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Put into Christ</h2>
<p>To be sanctified in Christ first means that we are put into Christ. Christ is a holy sphere, a sphere of holiness. Not only is Christ holy&mdash;Christ Himself is holiness. Because God has put us into this Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), we have been put into the sphere of holiness. Now that we are in Christ as the sphere of holiness, we are sanctified.</p>
<p>In Greek, the word rendered &ldquo;sanctified&rdquo; is actually a verbal form of the word for holiness. The word for holiness is <em>hagios,</em> and the verb that means sanctified is <em>hagiazo.</em> To be sanctified is to be made holy. Therefore, to be sanctified in Christ Jesus is to be made holy in Him.</p>
<p>Do you know what holiness is? Real holiness is Christ. The holiness in this universe is Christ Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Three Schools of Teaching<br />
concerning Holiness</h2>
<p>Among Christians there are three main schools of teaching concerning holiness or sanctification. The first school teaches that holiness is a matter of sinless perfection. This concept of holiness was that taught by John Wesley. According to this concept, holiness is equal to sinless perfection. Certain denominations, the so-called holiness people, practice a kind of holiness that is of the school of sinless perfection. Furthermore, these denominations may require their members to obey certain regulations in order to be regarded as practicing holiness. These regulations include rules concerning clothing, make-up, and the length of their hair.</p>
<p>The teaching that holiness is a matter of sinless perfection absolutely is not scriptural. There is no ground in the Scriptures for this teaching. As we shall see, according to the Bible, real holiness is not a matter of sinless perfection.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the Brethren, raised up under the leadership of John Nelson Darby, showed from the Bible that holiness is not sinless perfection. Using Matthew 23:17, they showed how the temple sanctified the gold. It was the temple that made the gold holy. These teachers pointed out that the gold in the marketplace, although there was nothing sinful about it, was not holy until it had been offered to God and put into His holy temple. Only then was the gold sanctified. Furthermore, using Matthew 23:19, these teachers proved that, according to the words of the Lord Jesus, the altar sanctifies the sacrifice. When an ox or a lamb was still in the fold, it was common. It did not become holy until it was offered to God on the altar. Doctrinally speaking, these Bible teachers defeated the teaching that holiness is a matter of sinless perfection. According to this teaching concerning holiness, holiness involves a change of position.</p>
<p>These Bible teachers also appealed to 1 Timothy 4:4-5, which says that food is sanctified by the prayer of the saints. When food is in the marketplace, it is common. But when the food is placed on the saints&rsquo; dining table and is prayed over by the saints, the food is sanctified by their prayer. This is a further indication that sanctification means a change of position.</p>
<p>In the light of all these verses, the Brethren taught that holiness is a change of position. Originally, our position was worldly and not at all for God. But when we were separated unto God, our position was changed, and, as a result, we became holy.</p>
<p>This teaching regarding holiness is correct as far as it goes. When we studied the different schools of sanctification years ago, we agreed with the teaching of the Brethren, for we saw that sinless perfection is not genuine holiness. However, there is a strong basis in the Scriptures to say that holiness is a change of position. Although it is true that holiness is a positional matter, through our study of the New Testament we have found that sanctification is also a dispositional matter. This means that sanctification is not only a change of position; it is also a change of disposition. Therefore, the sanctification revealed in the Bible includes dispositional transformation in addition to positional change.</p>
<p>I believe that this brief review of the different teachings with respect to sanctification will be helpful to us as we consider the significance of Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 1:2 concerning being sanctified in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Holiness is actually God Himself, and God is embodied in Christ. Therefore, Christ is our holiness. As our holiness, He is the sphere and element of holiness. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God has put us into Christ. Now that we are in Christ, who is the sphere and element of holiness, we are sanctified, made holy.</p><h2 class="head3">Saints in Christ</h2>
<p>When I was young I could not understand how Paul could say that the Corinthians were &ldquo;called saints.&rdquo; The condition of the church in Corinth was poor, and this book describes the negative things that were among the Corinthians. It seems that even the name &ldquo;Corinthians&rdquo; is negative. Nevertheless, Paul could address these Corinthians as saints. In themselves they were Corinthians, but in Christ they were saints.</p>
<p>What we have in 1:2 is the matter of being in Christ positionally. We should never despise our position in Christ. God has put us into Christ, and this makes it possible for us to experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. When we are in Christ, many positive things can be dispensed into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Sanctified by the Spirit<br />
as the Application with the Divine Nature</h2>
<p>In 6:11 Paul says, &ldquo;And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&rdquo; In this verse washing, sanctifying, and justifying are not by the blood in an objective way, as in 1 John 1:7, Hebrews 10:29, and Romans 3:24-25. These are the subjective washing of regeneration as in Titus 3:5, the subjective sanctifying by the Spirit as in 1 Peter 1:2, and the subjective justifying in the Spirit as here. All these items of God&rsquo;s salvation take place in us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, in the Person of the Lord, in organic union with the Lord through faith, and in the Spirit of God, that is, in the power and realization of the Holy Spirit. First, we are washed from sinful things; second, we are sanctified, separated unto God; and third, we are justified, accepted, by God.</p>
<p>In 6:11 the name of the Lord Jesus actually denotes His Person. Hence, to be in the name of the Lord Jesus is to be in Christ. As we have seen from 1:2, this is a positional matter. However, to be sanctified in the Spirit is dispositional. When God put us into Christ, Christ&rsquo;s Spirit came into us. Now we are sanctified not only in Christ; we are also sanctified in His Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Lifelong Matter</h2>
<p>To be put into Christ is a once-for-all matter. But to be sanctified by the Spirit is a lifelong matter. At the very moment we called on the name of the Lord Jesus, we were put into Christ. In this way we are now sanctified in Christ. Because God has put us into Christ, Christ&rsquo;s Spirit has entered into us and has become the sanctifying Spirit within us. Now this Spirit is sanctifying us all the time, and will continue to sanctify us during our entire life. Therefore, today we are still under the sanctifying work of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Dispensing of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The sanctifying of the Spirit is actually the dispensing of the Spirit into us. This means that sanctifying is equal to dispensing.</p>
<p>We may use the simple process of making a cup of tea as an illustration of the sanctifying work of the Spirit of God. First we have a cup of plain water, and then we put a tea bag into the water. Little by little, the tea in the bag is dispensed into the water. Through the dispensing of the element of tea into the water, the water becomes tea. We may say that the water is &ldquo;teaified&rdquo; through this process of dispensing.</p>
<p>In making tea, we use boiling water, and then we stir up the water once the tea bag has been placed into it. This stirring up of the hot water causes more dispensing. The tea comes out of the tea bag and enters into the water to teaify it. This may be used as an illustration of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>In our experience with the Lord, at times we may become cold. This coldness causes the divine dispensing to slow down. If we put a tea bag into cold water, it will be difficult for the tea to enter into the water. In like manner, it is difficult for God to dispense Himself into us when we are cold. For this reason He may use those in our family to &ldquo;heat us up.&rdquo; God may also use our situation at work or school to deal with our coldness and to make us burning for Him. Furthermore, He may use the saints in the church to stir us up. All this is a help to the divine dispensing. Then the element, color, flavor, and even essence of the divine tea will be dispensed into us. This dispensing is the sanctifying work of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard that sanctifying is a matter of dispensing? Through our experience we have come to realize that the Holy Spirit is the sanctifying Spirit. This Spirit dispenses His element into us, and this dispensing of the Spirit is the sanctifying work of the Spirit. Therefore, the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit is simply to dispense His element and essence with His &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; and &ldquo;color&rdquo; into our being to make us &ldquo;tea.&rdquo; As a result, we become a good drink to the Lord and to others.</p>
<p>If you consider your experience, you will see that from the time you began to love the Lord Jesus, this divine dispensing has been taking place within you. At times you may have become cold; however, you were not able to remain in your coldness. Actually, it is not difficult to be burning for the Lord. On the contrary, it is difficult for us to be cold. Which is easier in your experience&mdash;to be cold or hot? From my experience I can testify that it is much easier to be hot than cold.</p>
<p>The real danger is that we may become lukewarm. Concerning this, the Lord Jesus rebuked the church in Laodicea, saying, &ldquo;I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish you were cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth&rdquo; (Rev. 3:15-16). The Lord also told the Laodiceans to be zealous, boiling (Rev. 3:19, Gk.).</p>
<p>We do not want to be either cold or lukewarm&mdash;we want to be hot, boiling. In order to make us burning for His dispensing, the Lord may use certain people or certain matters in our environment to heat us up and stir us up. God knows how to make us hot so that the dispensing of the sanctifying Spirit may work in us effectively. God makes us hot so that Christ, the heavenly tea, may be dispensed into our being.</p>
<p>This dispensing concerning which we have been speaking is for the existence of the church. The existence of the church depends on the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. This means that the church&rsquo;s existence depends on God as the source, Christ as the sphere and element, and the Spirit as the application with the divine nature. Hence, through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity the church comes into existence.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE PRACTICAL LIFE IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:2, 24, 30; 2:7, 9-10, 12; 3:16; 6:11b</h1>
<p>In previous messages we have seen that the church is God&rsquo;s poem, His masterpiece (Eph. 2:10), and that the existence of the church comes through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The church is produced of God as the source (1 Cor. 1:2a), the church is sanctified in Christ as the sphere and element (1:2b), and the church is sanctified by the Spirit as the application with the divine nature (6:11b). In this message we shall go on to consider the dispensing work of the Divine Trinity with respect to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DISPENSING WORK OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
ON THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Having Predestinated Us for Glory</h2>
<p>In 2:7 Paul says, &ldquo;But we speak God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.&rdquo; The glory here is Christ, who is the Lord of glory (v. 8). Christ is our life today (Col. 3:4) and will be our glory in the future (Col. 1:27). To this glory God has called us (1 Pet. 5:10), and into it He will bring us (Heb. 2:10). This is the goal of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:5 says that God has predestinated us unto sonship. But in 1 Corinthians 2:7 Paul tells us that God has predestinated us unto glory. Sonship begins with regeneration and matures in glorification. We have been regenerated, and now we are in the process of being transformed. Eventually, our body will be transfigured, and our entire being will be glorified. In simple words, the glory in which we shall participate will be the maturity of sonship. For us to be predestinated unto glory means that we are predestinated unto the maturity of sonship.</p>
<p>We all have been regenerated to become sons of God. Now we are growing and are being transformed. When the Lord Jesus comes, we shall be transfigured in our body and reach maturity. That maturity will be our glorification.</p>
<p>We may use the blossoming of a carnation plant as an illustration of glorification. When a carnation plant blossoms, it reaches its maturity. This blossoming of a carnation is its glorification. In a similar way, our maturity as sons will be our spiritual blossoming, our glorification.</p>
<p>Some may have the concept that because God has predestinated us unto glory, He will lift us out of our low condition and transfer us into a realm, a sphere, of glory. God&rsquo;s way is altogether different. God dispenses Himself into us, and the first step of God&rsquo;s dispensing is regeneration. Actually, God has regenerated us by dispensing Himself into our spirit. From the time of our regeneration, God has been seeking to dispense more and more of Himself into us. Whenever we are available to Him, He will dispense Himself into us a little more.</p>
<p>When we are not available to God for His dispensing, He is patient, knowing that sooner or later we shall make ourselves available to Him for the divine dispensing. Regarding this matter, God will continue to be patient, even if it is necessary for Him to wait many years until we are available for His dispensing. Whenever our situation affords God the opportunity to dispense Himself into us, He will do this work of dispensing. Through the divine dispensing we are gradually transformed.</p>
<p>Transformation through the divine dispensing involves a long process. But to the Lord a thousand years are as one day (2 Pet. 3:8). He is calm, and His way is slow. Once I heard a certain Bible teacher say that our God never does anything in a hurry. On the contrary, God acts slowly. He sanctifies and transforms us gradually. God&rsquo;s way is to take many years to complete the work of transformation in us.</p>
<p>In the book of Revelation the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I come quickly&rdquo; (Rev. 22:7). But nearly two thousand years have passed, and still He has not come. Furthermore, we do not know when the Lord will come. When the Lord says &ldquo;soon,&rdquo; He speaks according to His sense of time, not according to our sense of time. The point here is that God is working slowly to dispense Himself into us.</p>
<p>The elders and the leading ones in the churches need to learn that God is patient and longsuffering. Often the elders expect the saints in the local churches to reach maturity in a short period of time. I can testify that whenever I have had such an expectation concerning the saints, it was never fulfilled. For example, in the past I expected that the saints in a certain church would reach maturity after five or ten years. But after ten years had passed, the apparent condition of the church had not improved very much. As a result of experience, I have come to learn that the sanctifying work of the indwelling Spirit is a long, slow process.</p>
<p>Life grows slowly. The higher a particular kind of life is, the more slowly it grows. For example, mushrooms and mosquitoes, being rather low forms of life, grow quickly. But it takes at least twenty-one years for a human being to reach maturity. The principle here is that the higher the life is, the slower it grows. Since the divine life is the highest life, it grows at the slowest rate. If we see this, we shall not expect to grow quickly in the spiritual life. We should never expect mushrooming growth in the church life.</p>
<p>Since the divine life grows slowly in the saints, I would encourage the elders and leading ones in the churches to be patient and longsuffering. If we expect to see growth in the saints, we may be discouraged. However, sometimes when we are very discouraged and feel that the situation is hopeless, we see in the churches some signs of growth. Therefore, I would encourage not only the elders and leading ones but all the saints not to be disappointed with the rate of growth.</p>
<p>Some of the saints who are disappointed with the slowness of their growth may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, for years you have been telling us that it takes time to grow and be transformed. I have been in the recovery for many years, and I can&rsquo;t see any improvement with me. I am utterly discouraged with my condition.&rdquo; If I try to encourage these saints, they may say, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my actual situation. You may think that I am rather good, but the Lord knows how pitiful I am. He knows that in many ways I have become worse.&rdquo; I would like to say to these saints, &ldquo;I do not believe that concerning the matter of the divine life you have become worse. No, you have grown at least a little. Since you have grown, there is some improvement with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As long as we are in the &ldquo;garden&rdquo; of the local churches, we shall grow. We may grow quite slowly, but we certainly shall grow in the divine life. To be sure, even a little growth is better than no growth at all. It is a fact that many saints have experienced considerable growth in life. If we compare these saints today with what they were many years ago, we would see that with them there has been the definite growth in life.</p>
<p>God has predestinated us not only unto sonship but also unto glory. Because 1 Corinthians reveals that God has predestinated us unto glory, we may say that, in a sense, this book is deeper than the book of Ephesians. We should not be satisfied simply to be sons. Our desire should be to be glorified, to enter into glory.</p><h2 class="head3">Having Called Us into the Fellowship of His Son</h2>
<p>In 1:9 Paul says, &ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; This fellowship is the partaking of God&rsquo;s Son, the participation in Him. To be in this fellowship is to partake of the all-inclusive Christ, to participate in Him. God has called us into such a fellowship so that we may partake of Christ and enjoy Him as our God-given portion.</p>
<p>To be called into the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son actually means to be called into the participation and enjoyment of Christ. Fellowship means participation. We have seen that God has predestinated us unto glory. But how can we reach the glory to which we have been predestinated? We reach this glory by enjoying Christ. The One who predestinated us unto glory is also the One who has called us into the enjoyment of Christ. Now we need to enjoy Christ every day.</p>
<p>Every part of our enjoyment of Christ is also a part of the glory to which God has predestinated us. Do you know what the coming glory is? The coming glory is the totality of all our enjoyment of Christ. Today we may have some enjoyment of Christ, and tomorrow we shall also have some enjoyment of Christ. Eventually, our enjoyment of Christ will be put together, and the aggregate of all that we have enjoyed of Him will be glory. Hence, we reach glory through our daily enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>We shall not come into glory suddenly. Apparently, the Bible indicates that we shall be raptured into glory. Actually, we are growing into the coming glory. How do we grow into this glory? We grow into glory by enjoying Christ.</p>
<p>As we enjoy Christ, He dispenses Himself into us. We may use the eating of food as an illustration. As we enjoy the food we eat, the food is dispensed into us. Actually, our enjoyment of the food is the dispensing of the food into our being. In a similar way, our enjoyment of Christ is the dispensing of Himself into us. We need to learn how to remain in the fellowship of God&rsquo;s Son, that is, how to remain in the enjoyment of Christ, in the participation of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having Transferred Us into Christ</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 tells us, &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; What we believers, as the new creation, are and have in Christ is of God, not of ourselves. It is God who has put us in Christ, who has transferred us from Adam into Christ.</p>
<p>Although God has totally transferred us out of Adam and into Christ, according to our actual experience we have been transferred into Christ only in part. From the standpoint of our position as the result of God&rsquo;s working, we have been transferred into Christ, and now we are in Christ. But experientially we are not yet wholly in Christ. Therefore, God is continually seeking to dispense something of Christ into our being so that we may be transferred into Christ more and more.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word in 1:30 concerning our being in Christ is related to the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. After years of experience, we have come to see this. God is dispensing Himself into our being. The extent to which He has dispensed Himself into us is the degree to which He has transferred us into Christ experientially.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Having Become Power to Us from God</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 1:24 says, &ldquo;But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the crucified Christ preached by the apostles is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom. Wisdom is for planning, purposing; power is for carrying out, for accomplishing what is planned and purposed. In God&rsquo;s economy Christ is both.</p>
<p>According to 1:24, Christ has become power to us from God. It is only in the book of 1 Corinthians that Paul tells us that Christ is God&rsquo;s power and wisdom to us. In doing anything we need both wisdom and power. If we do not have wisdom, matters will be in confusion. But if we have wisdom without power, we shall not have the ability to carry out anything. We need wisdom and power, and Christ is both wisdom and power from God to us.</p>
<p>We need to realize that every day the living Christ is transfusing us with Himself as power to us from God. In ourselves we cannot be holy, victorious, or even patient. Therefore, we need Christ as our power. A married sister, for example, is not able in herself to be submissive to her husband. In order to be submissive, she needs the living Christ as her power.</p>
<p>In order to experience Christ as power to us from God, we need to know Christ as the life-giving Spirit. However, some Christians believe only in an objective Christ sitting in the heavens. They do not know that Christ is also the life-giving Spirit. If Christ were only in the heavens and were not the life-giving Spirit, He could not be power to us from God. Christ can be such power to us only because He is the life-giving Spirit. He is now the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is identical with the Spirit. As the pneumatic Christ, the Lord is within us as the <em>pneuma,</em> dispensing Himself into us continually.</p>
<p>In our daily living we need to turn inwardly to our spirit. We may use switching on electrical power as an illustration of turning to the spirit. When we need power to operate an electrical appliance, we simply need to turn on the switch. There is no need to go elsewhere to receive electrical power. In the spiritual life we also have a &ldquo;switch,&rdquo; and this switch is in our spirit, where Christ is. If someone is giving us a difficult time, we should not try in ourselves to be good. If we behave ourselves in a certain way, we are merely doing something outward. Instead of trying to be good in ourselves, we should come back to our spirit. Rather than dealing with the situation in an outward way, we need to come to our spirit. Concerning this, it is helpful to call on the name of the Lord Jesus. If we turn to our spirit, calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, immediately Christ will be transmitted as power from God to us. Then in a practical way this power will become our strength.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;current&rdquo; of the divine transmission of Christ as power is interrupted whenever we try to behave in an outward way without turning to our spirit. We need to be reminded to turn from the outward situation, the difficulty or problem in our environment, and come back to our spirit. For instance, a brother should not try to deal with his wife&rsquo;s temper, and a sister should not consider that her husband is too strong or that he does not show her enough love. Both the brother and the sister need to come back to the spirit and call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Whenever we turn inwardly to the spirit and call on the Lord, the power reaches us and becomes our strength. As a result, we are well able to face our particular situation. When we receive the divine dispensing in this way, we shall have the ability to be patient in a happy way instead of gnashing our teeth in an effort to be patient.</p>
<p>Only Christ as the power to us from God can enable us to bear our problems or be carried through a difficult situation. The situation of the church in Corinth was certainly full of problems and confusion. The only power that could bear such a situation was Christ as the power from God to the Corinthians.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word in 1:24 regarding Christ as power from God to us is certainly related to the divine dispensing. The Lord is dispensing Himself into our being as the power to us from God. This power is able to bring us through every kind of difficulty.</p><h2 class="head3">Having Become Wisdom to Us from God</h2>
<p>According to 1:24, Christ is also wisdom to us from God. Furthermore, in 1:30 Paul says, &ldquo;But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; Here we see that Christ has been made wisdom to us from God as three vital matters in God&rsquo;s salvation: righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life; sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul with His divine life; and redemption (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), by which we shall be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21).</p>
<p>Sometimes we may find ourselves forced into a &ldquo;corner&rdquo; by a particular situation. It seems that there is no way out. At such times we need to turn inwardly to our spirit. If we turn to our spirit, Christ will become our wisdom.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians wisdom refers to the high things of Christ&mdash;to Christ as our righteousness, sanctification, redemption, and even as everything to us. In this book wisdom, along with the deep things of God, refers to Christ. In this Epistle we see different aspects of Christ as our wisdom. To experience this wisdom is to experience Christ dispensing Himself into us.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to spend more time to pray-read verses such as 1:24 and 30. We need to dwell on these verses and muse upon them in order to assimilate Christ as power to us from God and also as wisdom to us from God to be our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. In our experience Christ should also be the hidden mysteries, mysteries that we cannot define but that we can experience. We need to get into the depth of the mysterious things of Christ Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Revealing to Us the Things God<br />
Has Prepared for Us in Christ</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 2:9 and 10 say, &ldquo;But even as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man&rsquo;s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him. For God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&rdquo; Here we see that the Spirit reveals to us the things God has prepared for us in Christ. In verse 12 Paul goes on to say that we have received the Spirit from God so that we may know the things which have been freely given to us by God.</p>
<p>In 2:10 we see that the things God has prepared for us are revealed to us through the Spirit. This verse tells us not that the Spirit teaches but that the Spirit reveals. To teach is related to our mind; to reveal is related to our spirit. To realize the deep and hidden things God has prepared for us, our spirit is more necessary than our mind. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion. This is to reveal the hidden things planned by His wisdom concerning Christ, things which have never come up in man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s economy the Father plans, the Son accomplishes, and the Spirit comes to us to apply what the Father has planned and what Christ the Son has accomplished. Therefore, we cannot experience Christ as power and wisdom to us from God unless the Spirit applies Christ in our spirit. This means that if we would experience Christ, we cannot afford to stay away from the Spirit. Furthermore, we cannot separate Christ from the Spirit in our spirit, for He is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>The Spirit reveals to us all that Christ is. This revealing is actually a dispensing. However, we may think that the revealing to us of the things of Christ is simply a matter of vision, a matter of the Spirit showing us something. Actually, revealing involves dispensing. If we do not have the divine dispensing, anything the Spirit reveals to us will be nothing more than doctrine to us. But when we have the divine dispensing as our enjoyment, then the revelation of the Spirit is not merely objective doctrine, but a subjective experience and enjoyment of Christ. In this way through the Spirit&rsquo;s dispensing we see Christ experientially.</p>
<p>Suppose you are suffering in the midst of a particular situation. Instead of trying to handle the situation in an outward way, you inwardly turn to your spirit and enjoy Christ as power to you from God. At such a time you will have the sense deep within that the Triune God is dispensing Himself in Christ through the Spirit into your being.</p><h2 class="head3">Dwelling in the Church</h2>
<p>In 3:16 we see that the Spirit dwells in the church: &ldquo;Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?&rdquo; In this verse &ldquo;a temple of God&rdquo; refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, as in Corinth. But in the following verse &ldquo;the temple of God&rdquo; refers to all the believers universally. The unique spiritual temple of God in the universe has its expression in many localities on earth. Each expression is a temple of God in a particular locality. To say that the Spirit of God dwells in the believers as a temple of God means that the Spirit of God dwells in the church. The dwelling of the Spirit of God in the church is also a matter of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>As we consider all these verses in 1 Corinthians, we see that the unique thing that is taking place in the church life is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. I realize that in the book of 1 Corinthians we cannot find the word &ldquo;dispensing.&rdquo; But just as we have the fact of the Trinity in the Bible even though this word is not used, we also have the fact of the divine dispensing even though this term cannot be found in the Scriptures. Day by day this dispensing is taking place among us in the church life. Therefore, the church life in a practical way is the issue of this divine dispensing. The divine dispensing of the Triune God results in the practical church life. The proper church life comes from the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>If we see this, we shall realize that we cannot teach anyone how to have the proper church life. No, the proper church life comes only through the dispensing of the Triune God into us. The more we have this dispensing, the more we have the genuine and proper church life. I hope that many of us will enter into the depths of Christ through the divine dispensing of the Triune God in our practical church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE PRACTICAL LIFE IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 4:15; 3:6-12, 16; 6:17, 19; 7:40</h1>
<p>In 3:6 Paul says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.&rdquo; Although Paul&rsquo;s writing here is simple and brief, his thought is deep. What does it mean to plant and to water? It actually is not easy to answer these questions. Furthermore, what does it mean to say that God made to grow?</p>
<p>In 3:12 Paul goes on to speak of gold, silver, and precious stones. How shall we explain the meaning of these things, and how shall we apply them to our practical church life? The subject of this series of messages is &ldquo;The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity in First Corinthians,&rdquo; and the title of this particular message is &ldquo;Issuing in the Practical Life in a Local Church.&rdquo; How shall we apply the gold, the silver, and the precious stones to the practical life in a local church? It is difficult to explain how to apply these matters in the church life.</p>
<p>In 3:16 Paul says, &ldquo;Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?&rdquo; Here we have the profound thought that we are the temple of God. But how is it possible for us to be the temple of God? In what way are we God&rsquo;s temple? What does it mean to say that the Spirit of God dwells in us? It is also difficult for us to answer these questions.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:19 says, &ldquo;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?&rdquo; The Holy Spirit is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16), and our spirit is within our body. Hence, our body becomes a temple, a dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We may appreciate our spirit much more than our body. Many problems are caused by our body. Nevertheless, in 6:19 Paul says that our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. It is marvelous that even our body has become a temple for God&rsquo;s Spirit. When we talk about our spirit, we may become excited. However, we are often troubled by our body. Nevertheless, even this troublesome body is God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>In 6:17 we have a marvelous word: &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; This refers to the believers&rsquo; organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (John 15:4-5). This is a matter not only of the divine life but also in the divine life. Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;one spirit&rdquo; in 6:17 indicate the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us (1 Cor. 6:19) and is one with our spirit (Rom. 8:16). This mingled spirit is our realization of the Lord who became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) and who is now with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). This mingled spirit is often referred to in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, as in Romans 8:4-6.</p>
<p>I am not able to explain in full what it means to be one spirit with the Lord. Are you able to explain this thoroughly? Although we cannot explain it adequately, we know from experience that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. However, I am concerned that many Christians have too little experience of being one spirit with the Lord. Many Christians may not even know that there is a verse in the Scriptures telling us that we are one spirit with the Lord.</p>
<p>I was a Christian for over thirty years before I began to pay proper attention to 1 Corinthians 6:17. I had studied the book of 1 Corinthians, and I had given many messages on it. I was very familiar with the contents of this Epistle. Then one day, about twenty-five years ago, I began to consider this verse. I asked myself what it means to be joined to the Lord as one spirit. Is the spirit in 6:17 the divine Spirit or the human spirit? At first, I found it almost incredible that we and the Lord are actually one spirit. Even now, many years after I began to see this verse, I cannot tell you fully what it means to say that we and the Lord have been joined to be one spirit.</p>
<p>As we have pointed out, in 6:17 we have the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our regenerated spirit. Hence, the spirit here involves both the divine Spirit and the human spirit. Because we have emphasized this verse, some have falsely accused us of teaching that we have become a part of the Third of the Divine Trinity. We, of course, do not teach any such thing. Nevertheless, in 6:17 Paul says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. What a wonderful fact! Even if we are not able to understand this or explain it adequately, we can experience it. Surely one of the greatest of all the wonders in the universe is the fact that those who believe in Christ have been joined to Him to be one spirit with Him.</p>
<p>When I was young, I read a message by D. L. Moody in which he said that the new birth is the wonder of wonders. In that message Moody pointed out that formerly we were sinners, enemies of God. But through the new birth we have been born of God to become sons of God. At the time, I agreed with Moody in saying that the greatest wonder is the wonder of the new birth. Chapter three of the Gospel of John speaks of this new birth. In particular, verse 6 says, &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; First Corinthians 6:17 is a verse that is even higher than John 3:6. Not only have we been regenerated of the Spirit of God&mdash;we are now one spirit with God. Which do you think is greater&mdash;to be born of God or to be one spirit with Him? If this question were asked of me, I would say definitely that although it is a great matter to be born of God, it is an even greater matter to be one spirit with the Lord.</p>
<p>When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 6:17, he was full of assurance. He had the confidence that he was one spirit with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MOST SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>At the end of chapter seven, a long chapter concerned with married life, Paul says, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God&rdquo; (v. 40). In the previous chapter Paul said that he was one spirit with the Lord. But in 7:40 he says, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; This indicates that he may not have been sure. I did not know how to reconcile these verses.</p>
<p>In 7:10 Paul says, &ldquo;I charge, not I but the Lord.&rdquo; In verse 12 he says, &ldquo;I say, not the Lord.&rdquo; In verse 25 he goes on to say, &ldquo;I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion.&rdquo; Then in verse 40 he says, &ldquo;But she is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; All these verses indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation&mdash;the principle of God and man, man and God, becoming one. This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy&mdash;speaking for God. In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came to a prophet (Jer. 1:2; Ezek. 1:3), the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God. But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him. As a result, both speak together. His word becomes their word, and what they utter is His word. Hence, the apostle&rsquo;s charge is the Lord&rsquo;s charge (1 Cor. 7:10). What he says, though not by the Lord, still becomes a part of the divine revelation in the New Testament (v. 12). He is so one with the Lord that even when he gives his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord (v. 25), he still thinks that he also has the Spirit of God. He does not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he <em>thinks</em> that he <em>also</em> has the Spirit of God. This is the highest spirituality, the spirituality based on the principle of incarnation.</p>
<p>I can remember that one day in 1948 Brother Nee pointed out in fellowship with some of us that 1 Corinthians 7 is the most spiritual chapter in the Bible. I wondered how a chapter concerned with married life could be considered the most spiritual chapter in the Scriptures. Brother Watchman Nee said that in this chapter we not only have married life, but we also have the matter of the spirit. He pointed out that according to 1 Corinthians 7 Paul wrote certain things even though he did not have the commandment of the Lord. How would you react if someone told you that he did not have any commandment of the Lord, yet he went on to give you instructions regarding a certain thing? Is it not likely that you would refuse to listen to him? Brother Nee helped us to see that in 1 Corinthians 7 we have a person who did not have the word of the Lord, but spoke his own word, even his own opinion. Eventually, Paul could say in verse 40 that he thought he also had the Spirit of God. This, Brother Nee said, is the most spiritual experience.</p>
<p>Eventually I became convinced that no spiritual experience is as deep as that revealed in 1 Corinthians 7. Here we have a man who tells us that he does not have the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. Then he proceeds to give his own opinion. After giving his opinion, he tells us, &ldquo;I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&rdquo; Here Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;I am giving you my word, my opinion, without any commandment from the Lord. But I think that I nevertheless have the Spirit of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we had been able to question Paul concerning this, he might have replied, &ldquo;Brother, I am now practicing what I wrote about in 6:17. It is certainly right to say that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. Now when I say that I think I also have the Spirit of God, I am living the Lord. I live the Lord in this one spirit. Even when I give you my opinion, I still have the Spirit of the Lord, although I don&rsquo;t have the boldness to declare with assurance that I have the Spirit. However, those who are childish and shallow may say with assurance that they have the Spirit of God. Actually, they don&rsquo;t have that kind of assurance. But what I am saying is a description of my living of the Lord.&rdquo; If we see this, we shall realize that chapter seven of 1 Corinthians describes something profound.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE BIRTH AND THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>In the remainder of this message and in the two following messages, we shall give our attention to four matters seen in 1 Corinthians: birth, growth, transformation, and identification. First we have the birth of the members of the church and then the growth and transformation of these members. We also have the identification of the members of the church with the Lord. These four matters of birth, growth, transformation, and identification are profound. Birth is through the gospel (4:15) and in Christ Jesus. Growth is through the planting and watering of God&rsquo;s fellow-workers (3:8-9) and with the essence of God, who gives the growth (3:6-7). Transformation is through the builders&rsquo; building work (3:10-12) and by the indwelling Spirit with the divine essence and element (3:16). Identification is a matter of being one spirit with the Lord as the embodiment of the Triune God. This is by the indwelling Spirit as the mingling and saturating Spirit (6:17, 19) and involves having the Spirit of God (7:40).</p>
<p>No one can fully explain what human birth is, much less the divine birth. Although it is easy to understand the process of making a wooden table, we do not understand fully what is involved with either a human birth or the divine birth. We all were born of our parents, but we are not able to adequately explain this birth.</p>
<p>Although we do not know thoroughly what birth is, we can be certain of a basic principle related to birth. This principle is that birth is altogether a matter of the dispensing of life. Adopting a child, on the contrary, is not related to life. Instead, adoption involves the fulfillment of certain legal requirements. But birth is a matter of life. In particular, birth comes through the dispensing of life. A father&rsquo;s life is dispensed into his child. Therefore, the story of one&rsquo;s birth is a story of life-dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEGOTTEN THROUGH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Paul says a word concerning spiritual birth in 4:15: &ldquo;For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;guides&rdquo; here means child-conductors. These guides or child-conductors give instructions and directions to the children under their guardianship. Fathers, however, impart life to the children whom they beget. Paul was such a father. He had begotten the Corinthian believers in Christ through the gospel. He had imparted the divine life into them so that they could become children of God and members of Christ.</p>
<p>In 4:15 Paul seems to be telling the Corinthians, &ldquo;You Corinthians were all reborn through me. I am your begetting father. It was through me that the divine life was dispensed into you.&rdquo; Through this life-dispensing the Corinthians had experienced the new birth.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have never realized that when you were regenerated, you received a rich dispensing of life. Apart from the dispensing of the divine life into our being, we never could have experienced the divine birth, a spiritual birth. The spiritual birth, the new birth, is totally a matter of the dispensing of the divine life. Our regeneration was the beginning of the dispensing of the divine life into us. From the time we were born of God, this dispensing has not ceased. As we shall see, the divine life in us will grow, will increase, through the continuation of the divine dispensing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE PRACTICAL LIFE IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 4:15; 3:6-12, 16; 6:17, 19; 7:40</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider some verses from chapter three of 1 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD,<br />
THE SOURCE OF GROWTH</h2>
<p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.&rdquo; Planted, watered, and made to grow are all related to the matter of life. This indicates that the believers are God&rsquo;s farm to grow Christ. The ministers of Christ can only plant and water. God is the only One who can make to grow. The Corinthian believers overestimated the planter and waterer, but neglected the One who makes to grow. Hence, they did not grow in Christ as their life.</p>
<p>The Corinthians were neglecting God as the source of growth. The source of their growth was neither Paul nor Apollos. Yet the Corinthians were paying more attention to them than they were to God Himself who is the source of their growth in life.</p>
<p>The Corinthian believers, under the prevailing influence of Greek philosophical wisdom, paid too much attention to knowledge, but they neglected life. In this chapter Paul&rsquo;s intention is to turn their attention from knowledge to life and to point out that to them he is a feeder and a planter, Apollos is a waterer, and God is the Giver of growth. In 4:15 he even tells them that he is their spiritual father, the one who begot them in Christ through the gospel. From the view of life, the divine view, they are God&rsquo;s farm to grow Christ. This is totally a matter of life, a matter that is utterly missed by believers who are dominated by their soulish, natural life under the influence of their natural wisdom.</p>
<p>In 3:7 Paul continues, &ldquo;So that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God.&rdquo; As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether planters or waterers, are nothing, but God is everything. We must turn our eyes from them to God alone. This delivers us from the divisiveness which results from appreciating one minister of Christ above another.</p>
<p>In chapter three of 1 Corinthians, Paul was trying to turn the philosophical Greek believers from mental knowledge to life in the spirit. First he pointed out that he gave them milk to drink (3:2); hence, he was a feeder. Then he goes on to indicate that he was one who planted and Apollos was one who watered. Furthermore, Paul says that, with respect to the growth in life, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything. God, the One who gives the growth, is everything. However, Christians often appreciate a certain speaker and elevate him above others. Therefore, we need to realize that no minister of Christ can ever be the source of our growth in life. This source is God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FELLOW-WORKERS</h2>
<p>In verse 8 Paul says, &ldquo;Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.&rdquo; This reward is an incentive to the ministers of Christ who labor by planting or watering on God&rsquo;s farm.</p>
<p>In verse 9a Paul testifies, &ldquo;For we are God&rsquo;s fellow-workers.&rdquo; This indicates that God also is a worker. While the ministers of Christ, His fellow-workers, are working on His farm, He is also working. What a privilege and a glory that men can be God&rsquo;s fellow-workers, working together with God on His farm to grow Christ!</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FARM, GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>Verse 9b says, &ldquo;You are God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; Literally, the Greek word rendered &ldquo;farm&rdquo; means cultivated land. The believers who have been regenerated in Christ with God&rsquo;s life are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, a farm in God&rsquo;s new creation to grow Christ so that precious materials may be produced for God&rsquo;s building. Hence, we are not only God&rsquo;s farm but also God&rsquo;s building. Corporately, we as the church of God have Christ planted in us. Christ must also grow in us and out of us to produce, in the sense of this chapter, not the fruit, but the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God&rsquo;s habitation on earth. Thus, the building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness.</p>
<p>According to these verses, the growth in the divine life produces precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones&mdash;for the building up of God&rsquo;s habitation. This habitation, the church, is the increase, the enlargement, of the unlimited Christ. The growth in life is altogether a matter of the continual dispensing of the divine life into our being.</p>
<p>It is important for us to realize what the practical life of a local church is. The practical church life is actually the continual increase of Christ in our growth in life through the divine dispensing of the divine life into our being. A few years ago a particular church may have had a small measure of the divine life. But now, through the dispensing of the divine life into the saints, the measure of Christ in that church has increased. This is the increase of Christ through the growth in life by the divine dispensing of the divine life.</p>
<p>In 3:10 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.&rdquo; In Matthew 16:18 the Lord says that He will build His church; yet here Paul says that he is a builder, even a wise master builder. This indicates that the Lord builds the church not directly, but through His ministers, even through every member of His Body, as revealed in Ephesians 4:16. Although in 1 Corinthians 3:6 and 7 the apostle admits that he is nothing, he frankly and faithfully makes it clear in verse 10 that by the grace of God he is a wise master builder who has laid the unique foundation, Christ, for others to build upon.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILDING WITH PRECIOUS MATERIALS</h2>
<p>The church, the house of God, must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, materials produced from Christ growing in us. However, there is much possibility that we may build with wood, grass, and stubble produced by us in the flesh. Hence, each of us, including every member of the Body, must take heed how he builds, that is, with what material he builds.</p>
<p>In verse 11 Paul says, &ldquo;For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.&rdquo; As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church (Matt. 16:16-18). No one can lay any other foundation.</p>
<p>Verse 12 continues, &ldquo;But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble.&rdquo; Here we have two groups of materials. The first group includes gold, silver, and precious stones; the second group includes wood, grass, and stubble. Since the unique foundation has been laid, the question now before us concerns what kind of materials we are using to build on this foundation. What materials are you using to build the church? Are you building with gold, silver, and precious stones or with wood, grass, and stubble?</p>
<p>The foundation is unique, but the building may differ due to different builders with different materials. All the Corinthian believers had accepted Christ as the foundation. However, some Jewish believers among them attempted to build the church with their Judaistic attainments, and some Greek believers attempted to use their philosophical wisdom. They were not like the apostles, who built with their excellent knowledge of Christ and rich experiences of Him. The intention of Paul in this Epistle is to warn the believers at Corinth not to build the church with the things of their natural background. They must learn to build with Christ, both in objective knowledge and subjective experience.</p>
<p>Two sources of trouble in the church in Corinth were Greek philosophy and the Jewish religion. To build the church with the things of Greek philosophy or Jewish religion is to build with wood, grass, and stubble, not with gold, silver, and precious stones.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God. It is with these the apostles and all spiritual believers build the church on the unique foundation of Christ. Gold may signify the nature of the Father with all its attributes, silver may signify the redeeming Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His Person and work, and precious stones may signify the transforming work of the Spirit with all its attributes. All these precious materials are the products of our participation in Christ and enjoyment of Him in our spirit through the Holy Spirit. Only these materials are good for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s thought in 3:12 is profound. Why does he mention three precious materials instead of two or four? The reason must be that the proper materials for God&rsquo;s building are related to the Triune God, to the Trinity of the Godhead&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s nature, the Son&rsquo;s redemptive work, and the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>As God&rsquo;s farm with planting, watering, and growing, the church should produce plants. But the proper materials for the building up of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones, all of which are minerals. Hence, the thought of transformation is implied here. We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life, as revealed in 2 Corinthians 3:18 and Romans 12:2. This corresponds to the thought in the Lord&rsquo;s parables in Matthew 13 concerning wheat, the mustard seed, and meal, all of which are of the plant life, and the treasure hidden in the field, the gold, and the precious stones, all of which are minerals. (See notes 31<sup>1</sup>, 33<sup>3</sup>, and 44<sup>1</sup> in Matthew 13.)</p>
<p>We have indicated that in Paul&rsquo;s word in these verses from 1 Corinthians 3 the thought of transformation is implied. First, Paul tells us that the church is God&rsquo;s farm. Since a farm produces plants, how can we have the minerals necessary for God&rsquo;s building? How can the plants produced on the farm become these minerals? Plants can become minerals through the process of transformation. An illustration of this process is the transforming of wood from certain trees into petrified wood. As a result of this process, wood is transformed into stone.</p>
<p>We need both to grow in life and to be transformed in life. Transformation is a profound matter. Transformation is both deeper and higher than growth. What a wonder that wood can be transformed into precious stone! How marvelous!</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul writes concerning the experience of transformation: &ldquo;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. In this way we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence.</p>
<p>This transformation takes place mainly by the renewing of our mind. Concerning this renewing Paul says in Romans 12:2, &ldquo;Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind.&rdquo; Today we are still undergoing the process of transformation to become precious stones for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>In 3:12 Paul speaks not only of gold, silver, and precious stones, but also of wood, grass, and stubble. Wood, grass, and stubble signify the knowledge, realization, and attainments that come from the believers&rsquo; natural background (such as Judaism or other religions, philosophy, and culture) and the natural way of living (which is mostly in the soul and in the natural life). Wood may be in contrast to gold and may signify the nature of the natural man. Grass may be in contrast to silver and may signify the fallen man, the man of the flesh (1 Pet. 1:24), not redeemed by Christ. Stubble may be in contrast to precious stones and may signify the work and living which issue from an earthly source, a work and living without any transformation by the Holy Spirit. All these worthless materials are the product of the believers&rsquo; natural man together with what they have collected from their background. In God&rsquo;s economy these materials are fit only to be burned (v. 13).</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO GROW AND BE TRANSFORMED</h2>
<p>In this message we have emphasized the need for growth and transformation. How can we grow and be transformed? The only way to grow and be transformed is to have the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Reality of the Divine Birth</h2>
<p>As believers in Christ, we all are those who have been reborn. We all have experienced the divine birth. This birth is not merely a theological doctrine, and regeneration is more than a term. Regeneration is a spiritual fact, even a divine fact.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God, and the divine life are all real. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God entered into us to impart God&rsquo;s life, eternal life, into our being. In reality and in practicality, the divine life has been imparted to our spirit. This is not a doctrinal matter. Something divinely real and practical has been imparted into our being.</p>
<p>If the receiving of the divine life through regeneration were not a reality, then our believing in the Lord Jesus would be vanity. But believing in the Lord Jesus is not vanity; it is a marvelous reality. Through our believing in Him eternal life, the very life of God, has been imparted to our being.</p>
<p>From the time of our regeneration, the life-imparting Spirit has been with our spirit. Now this Spirit with the divine life abides in our spirit. Whenever we contact our Lord, the Triune God, through the exercise of our spirit, the indwelling Spirit imparts more life into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting the Lord by Exercising Our Spirit</h2>
<p>From experience we have learned that we may contact the Lord by calling on His name and by proper prayer. Many times we have prayed improperly; that is, we have prayed only from our mind, neglecting our spirit. Those who pray only with the mind may sometimes pray from memory and at other times may think about what they should pray before uttering anything in prayer. In order to have a proper prayer, we need to pray by our spirit and from our spirit. When we call on the name of the Lord and exercise to have proper prayer, our spirit is exercised. At such a time the &ldquo;switch&rdquo; is turned on, and the &ldquo;current&rdquo; of the divine life flows within us. The more this current flows, the more the divine life is added to our being. The more this current flows, the more the divine life increases within us.</p>
<p>The increase of the divine life within us depends on our contacting the Lord by praying and calling upon Him. This is the reason the New Testament tells us to pray without ceasing (1 Thes. 5:17). Praying without ceasing can be compared to breathing. If we want to stay alive, we must breathe all the time. No matter what we are doing, we need to breathe. Whether we are awake or asleep, whether we are working or resting, we need to keep on breathing. A husband continues to breathe even when he is exchanging words with his wife. It would be ridiculous for a husband to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy arguing with my wife. I don&rsquo;t have time to breathe.&rdquo; In order to maintain our physical life, we must breathe all the time. The principle is the same with our spiritual life. Whenever we stop breathing, we experience spiritual death. To experience death in the spiritual sense is equal to switching off the current of the divine life. Just as a person dies when his blood stops circulating, so we experience spiritual death when the divine life stops circulating within us.</p>
<p>Many Christians are dead, spiritually speaking. The current of the divine life does not flow within them. Do you know the reason so many Christians are spiritually dead, the reason they do not have the divine life flowing in them? The reason is that they do not contact the Lord by praying and calling on Him. For example, when a brother and his wife are exchanging words, they are not contacting the Lord. Furthermore, even when we are doing good things, the inner current of the divine life may stop flowing. In order to maintain the flowing of the divine life, we need to pray without ceasing.</p>
<p>How can we fulfill Paul&rsquo;s charge in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 to pray without ceasing? Years ago, I tried to find a book that answered this question, but I could not find one. Eventually, through experience with the Lord I discovered that to pray unceasingly is to exercise our spirit continually. We may use walking as an illustration. Walking is an exercise of our feet. If we want to walk, we need to exercise our feet. In like manner, seeing is an exercise of the eyes, and hearing is an exercise of the ears. But what does it mean to exercise our spirit? To exercise the spirit is to pray. This means that whenever we exercise our spirit, we pray. As one example, I can testify that whenever I am giving a message, I am exercising my spirit. Through this exercise of my spirit, I look to the Lord for His instant transfusion and utterance. I do not know from one moment to the next what kind of utterance I should use. Therefore, while I am speaking, I am praying by exercising my spirit.</p>
<p>Praying does not necessarily mean that we utter something verbally. No, to pray is to exercise our spirit. If we realize this, then we shall see that even at work we can exercise our spirit to pray.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals clearly that the Spirit of God is in our spirit. Because the divine Spirit is with our regenerated spirit, when we exercise our spirit, the Spirit of God flows within us. As this divine current flows, it brings the element, even the essence, of the divine life into our being. In this way we receive more of the divine life. The result of the increase of the divine life within us is growth. Growth, therefore, is a matter of the continual increase of the divine life within us.</p><h2 class="head2">Transformation in the Divine Life</h2>
<p>Because this growth comes from the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, Paul told the Corinthians that neither he nor Apollos could cause growth. God is the only One who makes to grow. Only God Himself can flow in our being to bring in His divine essence to produce the growth in life.</p>
<p>The growth in life causes transformation. As the divine life grows within us, it transforms us.</p>
<p>The making of petrified wood is a good illustration of the process of transformation through the flowing of the divine life. I have been told that petrified wood is produced by the flowing of a current of water. As the water flows, it brings in the mineral element and carries away the element of wood. This means that through the flowing of the water, the wooden element is replaced by a mineral element. The flow of the current not only produces the increase of the mineral element but also causes transformation. Eventually, after many years, the wood that has been immersed in the flowing of this current is petrified. This is a picture of the process of transformation in the divine life.</p>
<p>By the way of implication Paul tells us in chapter three of 1 Corinthians that through growth plants can become minerals. First we have the growth on God&rsquo;s farm. Then the plants grown on this farm become the precious materials for God&rsquo;s building. We are God&rsquo;s farm, and this farm produces plants. But as these divine plants grow, their growth will bring in transformation. As a result, the plants grown on God&rsquo;s farm are transformed to become the materials for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>In 3:12 Paul speaks of gold, silver, and precious stones. Here the gold, silver, and precious stones signify the Triune God. We believe that the gold signifies the nature of God the Father, that the silver signifies the redeeming Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His Person and work, and that the precious stones signify the transforming work of the Spirit. As the current of the divine life flows within our being, a divine essence is added to us, a divine essence of the elements of gold, silver, and precious stones. The more this current flows in us, the more we have the increase, the enlargement, of the divine essence. This enlargement causes transformation. Eventually, not only do we grow, but we are also transformed into precious materials for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3 we see the growth and transformation of the believers. If we take care of this growth and transformation through the flowing of the current of the divine life within us, we shall see a great difference in our Christian life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE PRACTICAL LIFE IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(6)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 4:15; 3:6-12, 16; 6:17, 19; 7:40</h1>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:17 Paul says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the word &ldquo;joined&rdquo; refers to the believers&rsquo; organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is a matter not only of the divine life but in the divine life. The organic union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;one spirit&rdquo; indicate the mingling of the Lord as the Spirit with our spirit. Our spirit has been regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), who is now in us (1 Cor. 6:19) and who is one with our spirit. Through resurrection the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and as such a Spirit He is now with our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Hence, the one spirit in 1 Corinthians 6:17 is the mingled spirit, our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO SPIRITS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Human Spirit</h2>
<p>Every regenerated person has two spirits within him. First, a regenerated person has a regenerated human spirit. Second, dwelling within the regenerated human spirit there is the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Throughout the years we have placed strong emphasis on the importance of the human spirit. We have pointed out again and again that man has a spirit within him created by God. Concerning the human spirit, Zechariah 12:1 says, &ldquo;The Lord...stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.&rdquo; This verse indicates the importance of the human spirit, for here the spirit of man is ranked with the heavens and the earth. In the sight of God three aspects of His first creation are especially important: the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit. As we have said a number of times, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with his spirit is for God. It is by the spirit that man is able to contact God, receive God, and contain God.</p>
<p>As those who believe in Christ, not only do we have the human spirit created by God, but our human spirit has been regenerated, born of the divine Spirit. In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus speaks clearly concerning this fact: &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the Spirit is the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God. What is born of the Spirit is the human spirit, the regenerated spirit of man. Regeneration takes place in the human spirit by the Holy Spirit of God with God&rsquo;s life, the uncreated eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Compound Spirit</h2>
<p>Every regenerated person has the divine Spirit within him. In the New Testament this Spirit has different titles: the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:9), the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35), the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7, lit.), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). These titles of the Spirit are used interchangeably. Elsewhere in the New Testament the divine Spirit is called the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), and even the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4). In order to describe this Spirit, especially as the Spirit is typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30, we have coined the expression &ldquo;the compound Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that in Jesus Christ God was incarnated. The incarnation brought God into man. Through incarnation God actually became a man, and then lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years. At the end of this period of time, the Lord Jesus, the God-man, was crucified. Through His death on the cross He terminated all negative things. God needed Christ to terminate all negative things through His crucifixion. After dying on the cross, the Lord rested for three days, and then He was resurrected from among the dead. In and through His resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit includes the elements of divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. For this reason, we may speak of this Spirit as the compound Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD BEING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; To say that God is Spirit must mean that the Triune God is Spirit. We should not think that only the Spirit of God is Spirit and that the Father and the Son are not Spirit. It would be ridiculous to say that only one third of God is Spirit and that the other two thirds are not Spirit. In John 4:24 &ldquo;God&rdquo; must refer to the entire God, the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Hence, to say that God is Spirit means that the entire God, the complete God, is Spirit.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of traditional teaching concerning the Trinity, many believers, perhaps unconsciously, hold to a form of tritheism, the belief in three Gods. Today some claim that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not only distinct, but are also three separate Persons. Those who hold to this concept may say that only the Spirit is Spirit and that the Father and the Son are not Spirit. This is to say that only one third of the Godhead, the Spirit, is Spirit.</p>
<p>If we admit that the word spoken by the Lord Jesus in John 4:24 means that the entire God is Spirit, then we must also admit that the Father and the Son, and not only the Spirit, are Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the entire God, and the entire God, not merely a part, is Spirit. Therefore, all Three of the Godhead&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are Spirit. Regarding this, we do not care for traditional teaching. Instead, we care for the revelation of the pure Word of God. The Scriptures tell us that the entire God, the Triune God, is Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD REACHING US AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Do you know how the Triune God reaches us? He reaches us as the Spirit. The Spirit of the Triune God is actually God reaching us. Apart from the Spirit, neither the Father nor the Son can reach us.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s word in 2 Corinthians 13:14 indicates that the Triune God reaches us as the Spirit: &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment, the love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation. This verse indicates that we need not only the grace of Christ and the love of God, but also the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The word &ldquo;fellowship&rdquo; indicates transmission. Through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit the Triune God reaches us and communicates with us. Therefore, the entire God is Spirit, and the Spirit as the Third of the Trinity is God reaching us for our experience and enjoyment of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>It is common for Christians to appreciate the fact that the Lord Jesus is God. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; According to John 1:14, this Word, which was God, became flesh. Christians also know that the Lord Jesus is our Redeemer, Savior, Lord, and Master, the One who died for our sins. However, not many Christians have seen from 1 Corinthians 15:45 that the last Adam, the Lord Jesus, has become a life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Because of the influence of traditional teaching concerning the Trinity, many Christians will not admit that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. Concerning 1 Corinthians 15:45 some say, &ldquo;This verse doesn&rsquo;t mean that Christ became the Holy Spirit. This verse says only that Christ is a Spirit. When He was on earth, He was in the flesh. Now through resurrection He became a Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Paul added the modifier &ldquo;life-giving&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;Spirit.&rdquo; If the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is different from the Holy Spirit who gives life, then there are two Spirits who give life. But it is a fact that there is only one life-giving Spirit. In addition to the Holy Spirit, there is not another life-giving Spirit. It is heretical to say that in addition to the life-giving Spirit, Christ in resurrection has become another kind of Spirit who gives life. Do you believe that there are two divine Spirits, two Spirits who give life? We absolutely do not believe this.</p>
<p>Paul was careful in writing 1 Corinthians 15:45. He did not say, &ldquo;The last Adam became a Spirit.&rdquo; He added the modifier, &ldquo;life-giving,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Who is the Spirit who gives life? Do you believe that besides the Holy Spirit there is another divine Spirit who gives life? This is impossible.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:17 Paul clearly says, &ldquo;Now the Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; In Darby&rsquo;s New Translation, verses 7 through 16 of 2 Corinthians 3 are in parentheses, showing that verse 17 is the continuation of verse 6. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;The Spirit gives life.&rdquo; The Spirit mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17 is the very Spirit who gives life spoken of in verse 6. This proves that the Lord is the Spirit who gives life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT DWELLING IN US</h2>
<p>In this message we have covered three crucial points: first, that the entire God is Spirit; second, that the Triune God reaches us as the Spirit; and third, that through resurrection Christ, the last Adam, has become the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>The Father and the Son do not reach us directly. Rather, it is the Spirit who reaches us. When the Spirit reaches us, the Father and the Son also reach us, because the Three of the Godhead cannot be divided or separated. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit not only coexist eternally but also coinhere. The Father, Son, and Spirit exist in one another. Hence, when the Spirit reaches us, the Father and the Son also reach us.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Lord is now the Spirit. He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. Now as regenerated ones, we have this Spirit dwelling in us.</p>
<p>For some readers, what we have been speaking in this message may be new. Actually, what I have been giving you is not my word or teaching, but quotations from the New Testament. The New Testament reveals that God is Spirit, that the Third of the Trinity is the Spirit reaching us with the Son and the Father, and that today the Lord is the Spirit. At least two verses in the New Testament indicate this. First Corinthians 15:45 reveals that through resurrection and in resurrection Christ has become a life-giving Spirit. He has not become merely a Spirit; He has become the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life. Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 3:17 definitely says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, some would try to twist this verse and say that the Lord here is not the Lord Jesus Christ, but merely the Lord God. If we study the book of 2 Corinthians carefully, we shall see that the title &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; is always attached to the Lord Jesus (2 Cor. 1:2, 14; 4:5; 13:14), and God is called &ldquo;the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 1:3; 11:31). Therefore, the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17, as in verses 16 and 18, undoubtedly refers to the Lord Jesus, not to God the Father. To say that the Lord in this verse refers to God and not to the Lord Jesus is a twisting of the verse in order to cover over the revelation here that the Lord is the Spirit.</p>
<p>The New Testament reveals that our Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the Spirit dwelling in our regenerated spirit. Hallelujah for the wonderful Spirit within us! Hallelujah for the mingling of the divine Spirit with our regenerated human spirit!</p>
<p>To say that our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit does not mean that we shall ever be deified. To say that the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the regenerated human spirit, are one does not mean that we believe we shall become God as an object of worship. It is blasphemy for anyone to say that a person can become God and be worshipped as God. According to the Scriptures, we believe that our Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit dwelling in our spirit and mingled with our spirit. This is the significance of Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 6:17, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATURATED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>For what purpose has the life-giving Spirit come into our spirit? The life-giving Spirit has come into us for the purpose of the divine dispensing. In order to experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we need to turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit by praying in a proper way and by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. We can testify from experience that when we pray in our spirit, we enjoy the supply of the Triune God. The more we pray by exercising our spirit, the more we have the sense deep within that we are being saturated with the Triune God. We have the sense that we are being soaked in the life-giving Spirit. This saturating and soaking is a matter of life-dispensing.</p>
<p>The dispensing of the Triune God into us causes us to be members of the church who are growing and being transformed. Through this divine dispensing we shall eventually reach maturity. Through the divine dispensing we have received our divine birth, and through this dispensing we have growth and enjoy transformation. Now we are one spirit with the wonderful Triune God. This is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, a dispensing that issues in the practical life of a local church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MEMBERS<br />
IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:1, 3-11, 13, 18, 24, 28; 14:4, 5, 12, 25</h1>
<p>In this message we shall begin to consider 1 Corinthians 12. This is a difficult chapter to understand. Over the years I have spent a great deal of time on this chapter, but I do not yet have a thorough understanding of it.</p>
<p>In 12:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.&rdquo; In 12:1&mdash;14:40 Paul deals with the problem of spiritual gifts in relation to God&rsquo;s administration and operation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In 12:3 Paul says, &ldquo;Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The apostle&rsquo;s thought here is that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless. But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit. This kind of speaking is related to the spiritual gifts. No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, &ldquo;Jesus is accursed&rdquo;; he would like to say, and he is able to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Worshippers of God should not be silent; rather, they should speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God. This&mdash;to speak the Lord Jesus&mdash;is the main function of all the spiritual gifts.</p>
<p>In verse 3 Paul tells us that no one can say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; except in the Holy Spirit. This indicates that when we say with a proper spirit, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord,&rdquo; we are in the Holy Spirit. Hence, to call on the Lord Jesus is the way to participate in, enjoy, and experience the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>In 12:2 Paul tells the Corinthians, &ldquo;You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led.&rdquo; The worshippers in an idol temple do not speak; rather, they are silent, or dumb. They are voiceless worshippers, seeming not to have a mouth. But the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit. One important difference between those who worship idols and those who worship the living God is this: idol worshippers are silent, but those who worship the living God speak of the Lord in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, many Christians have been influenced by the silent worship of idols. As the result of this influence, the majority of those who enter into so-called places of worship are silent. Usually, they hire a pastor to do the speaking for them. The congregation remains silent, or dumb, and the speaking is done by the hired ones. This is the actual situation among many believers today.</p>
<p>The situation was very different in the days of the apostles. During the time of the apostles, when Christians came together, they made noise by speaking in the Spirit. They did not worship God in silence. As the psalmist said, they made a joyful noise to the Lord (Psa. 95:1). Hence, Paul&rsquo;s thought in 1 Corinthians 12, a chapter concerned with the function of the members in the church meeting, is that we all should speak in the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING AND THE EXERCISE<br />
OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS</h2>
<p>Speaking in the Holy Spirit is a matter related to spiritual gifts. When Christians today talk about spiritual gifts, they usually have in mind the gifts of speaking in tongues, healing, and miracles. However, in this chapter Paul indicates that the spiritual gifts are mainly related to speaking. Paul lists nine gifts, and of these nine five involve speaking: the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, prophesying, tongue-speaking, and the interpretation of tongues. The other four gifts listed by Paul are faith, healings, works of power, and the discerning of spirits. These four gifts are related to activity, not to speaking.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament understanding, a church meeting in which the spiritual gifts are exercised is a meeting in which there is much speaking. Suppose we come together for a meeting, and we all are silent. In such a meeting, there would not be any exercise of spiritual gifts. In order for the gifts to be exercised in a meeting of the church, we need to speak. I can testify that when I speak, I exercise my gift. Therefore, to exercise our gift means that we are exercised in speaking.</p><h2 class="head1">SPEAKING FOR THE LORD IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We all are able to speak for the Lord in the meetings. You should not think that a certain brother who has much experience in the Lord and much knowledge of the Word is able to speak, but you are not able to speak. Although you may not have as many spiritual riches as this brother, you still have something. You at least have some amount of spiritual riches and you need to spend what you have by speaking forth the Lord in the meetings.</p>
<p>The fact that we speak freely outside the meetings is a strong indication that we are also able to speak in the meetings. However, a brother may be silent in the meeting. Then after the meeting, perhaps on the way home, he may speak freely and boldly. We need to realize that we all are able to speak in the Spirit in the church meetings. We all are able to utter at least a simple word for the Lord.</p>
<p>An experience I had in a meeting of the church in Los Angeles in 1968 illustrates the fact that all believers can speak in the church meetings. On a certain Lord&rsquo;s Day morning I had the deep feeling that I should stand up and speak. I stood up, but I did not know what to say. Eventually, I told the saints that we all can prophesy, that we all can speak for the Lord. I went on to say that at least we all can speak four words. At this point I said to myself, &ldquo;What four words? What words will you encourage the saints to speak?&rdquo; Then I went on to say, &ldquo;We all can speak these four words: &lsquo;O&mdash;Lord&mdash;amen&mdash;hallelujah.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the meeting, I began to consider what I had said. At first I thought that I had been mistaken regarding the sequence of these four words. I said to myself, &ldquo;You spoke these words in the wrong sequence. Instead of saying, &lsquo;O Lord, amen, hallelujah,&rsquo; you should have said, &lsquo;O Lord, hallelujah, amen.&rsquo;&rdquo; But as I considered the matter further according to the Scriptures, I realized that Revelation 19:4 says, &ldquo;And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; According to this verse, &ldquo;amen&rdquo; comes first, and &ldquo;hallelujah&rdquo; follows. I was confirmed that the sequence in which I had spoken these four words was correct. I believe that I was led by the Spirit to point out to the saints that we all can say, &ldquo;O Lord, amen, hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;O Lord, amen, hallelujah!&rdquo; can be uttered in different ways. We may speak them strongly and loudly, or we may utter them slowly and quietly. Surely all the saints, from the youngest to the oldest, can speak these four words, especially in the meetings. The more the saints speak something for the Lord in the church meetings, the more living the meetings will be.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if we all practiced speaking for the Lord in our daily living. Even at home we can say, &ldquo;O Lord, amen, hallelujah!&rdquo; Would it not be wonderful if a sister would say, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; the husband replied, &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; and the children responded, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; This kind of speaking would help to produce a heavenly family life.</p>
<p>In the church meetings all the saints, especially the young ones and the new ones, can speak for the Lord in a simple way. For example, a new believer may stand up and say, &ldquo;Jesus the Lord is so precious to me! Every time I say, &lsquo;Lord Jesus,&rsquo; my heart is filled with His sweetness.&rdquo; After this, another young one may rise up and say, &ldquo;I want to testify to you all that the name of Jesus is so sweet.&rdquo; How excellent the meetings would be if they were filled with such speaking!</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SPEAKING PEOPLE</h2>
<p>A genuine and typical Christian is a speaking Christian. Christians are a speaking people. However, if we do not speak, we shall not look like real Christians.</p>
<p>Christians are those who have been made alive. Once we were dead, but now we are living. Those who are dead do not speak. All those buried in a cemetery are silent. We should not be dead, dumb believers. On the contrary, because we are living, we should demonstrate that we are living by speaking for the Lord in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Suppose as an experiment you tried to refrain from speaking for twenty-four hours. I believe that you would find this extremely difficult. Because we are living persons, we have the desire to speak. Why, then, are certain ones silent in the meetings? Since we are living, we should speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the worshippers of the living God should not be silent. Rather, we need to speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God. This kind of speaking is related to the exercise of the spiritual gifts. Speaking the Lord Jesus is the main function of the spiritual gifts. The purpose of our speaking in the meetings is to speak concerning the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12:4 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit.&rdquo; &ldquo;But&rdquo; here indicates a contrast between verses 3 and 4. Verse 3 says when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; exalting Jesus as Lord. &ldquo;But&rdquo; the gifts for the manifestation of the Spirit are diverse. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;distributions&rdquo; in this verse, as well as in verses 5 and 6, means diversities, varieties, distinctions.</p>
<p>The gifts in verse 4 refer to the outward gifts, the ability or enablement for service. Some of them are miraculous, and some are developed out of the initial gifts mentioned in 1:7. In 1:7 &ldquo;gift&rdquo; refers to the inward gifts issuing from grace, such as the free gift of eternal life (Rom. 6:23) and the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38) as the heavenly gift (Heb. 6:4), not the outward, miraculous gifts. All the gifts in chapter twelve are different from the initial gifts.</p>
<p>Verse 5 continues, &ldquo;And there are distributions of ministries, and the same Lord.&rdquo; These ministries are services. The gifts in verse 4 are for these services and they are for the operations in verse 6.</p>
<p>In verse 6 Paul says, &ldquo;And there are distributions of operations, but the same God, who is operating all things in all.&rdquo; These operations are works. The ministries or services in verse 5 are for these works.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OPERATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
IN OUR SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In 12:4-6 the gifts are by the Spirit; the ministries, the services, are for the Lord; and the operations are of God. Here the Triune God is involved in these three things&mdash;gifts, ministries, and operations. The gifts by the Spirit are to carry out the ministries, the services, for the Lord. The ministries for the Lord are to accomplish the operations, the works, of God. This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for the expression of God.</p>
<p>We have emphasized the fact that the gifts in chapter twelve are much related to our speaking. Whenever we speak, the Spirit works. We may think that we are the ones functioning in speaking; actually the Spirit is the one who functions. As we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers, and God operates. Our speaking, therefore, is of great importance. If we do not speak, the Spirit does not function, the Lord does not minister, and God does not operate. In a very real sense, the Triune God is waiting for us to speak something for Him.</p>
<p>The Spirit desires to function, the Lord wants to minister, and God intends to operate. But this depends on our exercising our spirit in speaking forth the Lord. Our speaking is crucial to God&rsquo;s operation. If we do not speak, if we are silent or dumb, the Triune God will be silent. But the more we speak by exercising our spirit, the more the Spirit will function, the Lord will minister, and God will operate. When we speak, the Spirit functions. When the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers. When the Lord ministers, God operates. Therefore, the functioning, ministering, and operating of the Triune God depend on our speaking.</p>
<p>Both in the meetings and in our practical, daily living, the Triune God responds to our speaking in our spirit by functioning, ministering, and operating. Let us suppose that a brother, his wife, and his children are having fellowship during a meal. As they all speak, the Spirit comes forth to function. Then the Lord follows to minister, and God operates. Many of us can testify of having this kind of experience in our daily life as well as in the meetings.</p>
<p>If we desire to have more of this kind of experience, we need to learn to stop gossiping. If we engage in gossip or vain talk, we shall not experience the operation of the Triune God in our speaking. We need to speak Christ, grace, and salvation. Because the Spirit is joined to our regenerated human spirit, whenever we speak these wonderful matters, the Spirit will function. Following the function of the Spirit, the Lord, who is one with the Spirit, will minister. When the Lord ministers, God the Father operates. This is the operation of the Triune God in our speaking in the Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MEMBERS<br />
IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:1, 3-11, 13, 18, 24, 28; 14:4-5, 12, 25</h1>
<p>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issues in the functions of the members in a local church. The functions of the members are the spiritual gifts, and these gifts are related to speaking in the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF SPEAKING IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In 12:1 Paul says, &ldquo;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.&rdquo; Then in verse 3 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse indicates that it is easy to function in the church meetings. We can function in the Spirit simply by saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; In addition, we may say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I love You. You are my life and my comfort. Lord Jesus, You strengthen me inwardly.&rdquo; How many things we can say concerning the Lord Jesus!</p>
<p>In the meetings of the church we can speak the name of the Lord. We can say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, Your name is Jehovah, the great I Am. Lord, You also are called Jesus, Christ, Emmanuel, the Son of God, the Son of Man, and the Redeemer. Lord, You are the Lamb of God, and You are even the door.&rdquo; As we mention the names of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit who dwells in our spirit will come in to function. Then the Lord will follow the Spirit to minister, to serve. The Lord will serve you, and then through you He will serve others. Furthermore, God will operate. He will accomplish something for the fulfillment of His purpose. By this we see that our speaking in the Spirit is a great matter.</p>
<p>In 12:1-3 Paul&rsquo;s intention is to impress us with the importance of speaking in the Spirit. However, some saints have been deceived concerning the matter of functioning in the meetings and think that they are not gifted and therefore cannot function. They may consider a certain experienced brother in the Lord and say, &ldquo;This is one very gifted. Through his years in the Lord, he has been equipped. But there is no way I can be like him.&rdquo; Actually, this way of thinking is a sign of unbelief. The truth is that we all can function. We can at least exercise our spirit to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; I can testify that when the saints exercise to speak in the meetings, it is much easier for me to give a message. Their speaking of the Lord stirs me up and inspires me to speak in the Spirit. We all need to speak in the meetings, and we all can speak. We can call on the Lord Jesus, and we can speak concerning Him.</p>
<p>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, in 12:4-6 we have diverse distributions of gifts by the same Spirit (v. 4), diverse distributions of ministries by the same Lord (v. 5), and diverse distributions of operations by the same God, who is operating all things in all (v. 6). In 12:1-6 there are four parties. We ourselves are the first party, and the other parties are the Spirit, the Lord, and God. We have seen that when we exercise our spirit to speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God operates. In a very real sense, we are crucial, and our part is a crucial part. The Spirit&rsquo;s functioning, the Lord&rsquo;s ministering, and God&rsquo;s operating require our speaking. Once again we see that we all need to speak in the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have heard much concerning the Lord Jesus, God&rsquo;s salvation, grace, redemption, justification, sanctification, and many other matters. Now we need to respond to what we have heard by speaking. A genuine Christian is a speaking Christian. Actually, we should speak not only in the meetings, but at home and on the way to the meetings.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Holy Spirit will be poured out through our speaking. We may compare our speaking concerning the Lord to the striking of a small match. We know that a single match can start a fire that will burn an entire building. therefore, we should not despise a little match. In a similar way, we should not despise our speaking, for it may cause many others to be set on fire in the Spirit.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that when we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God works. This is the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. This is the Triune God dispensing His riches into us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FLOWING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>We may also compare our regenerated spirit to a switch. When the switch is turned on, electricity flows into the appliances and causes them to work. A switch, therefore, is important. The flowing of electricity into a building is actually the dispensing of electricity into the building. Likewise, the flowing of the divine electricity, the flowing of the Triune God, is the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. But for this dispensing to take place, we need to &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; by exercising our spirit to speak. If we do this, we shall have the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issuing in the functions of the members in a local church.</p>
<p>Concerning the dispensing of the Triune God, we occupy a crucial place. We can be compared to the switch. When we speak, the switch is turned on, and the divine dispensing, the flowing of the divine electricity, takes place. When we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God works. As a result, the divine dispensing will take place in the church meetings, and all the members will be infused with the Triune God.</p>
<p>In 12:4-6 we have the Trinity. There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord. There are diversities of operations, but the same God. Here we have the Spirit, the Lord, and God&mdash;the Triune God. However, the Divine Trinity is waiting for us to take the initiative to speak. When we speak, the Triune God will cooperate by carrying out the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In 12:4-11 Paul speaks of the manifestation of the Spirit by different gifts. In verse 7 he says, &ldquo;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.&rdquo; All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit; that is, the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts. Such manifestation of the Spirit is for the profit of the church, the Body of Christ. The manifestation of the Spirit is for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of Christ&rsquo;s Body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word of Wisdom</h2>
<p>In verses 8 through 10 Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;For to one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit.&rdquo; According to the context of this book, the word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God predestined by God for our portion (1:24, 30; 2:6-10). The word of knowledge is the word that imparts a general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord (8:1-7). The word of wisdom is mainly of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching. The former is deeper than the latter. However, the two, not the speaking in tongues nor any other miraculous gift, are listed as the first gifts and the topmost manifestation of the Spirit because these two are the most profitable ministries or services for the edification of the saints and the building up of the church to carry out God&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<p>The word of wisdom is mainly a word from our spirit concerning Christ as God&rsquo;s wisdom. In chapters one and two we see that in this Epistle wisdom refers to Christ. We need to study the Scriptures in order to learn the things concerning Christ. Christ is the wisdom from God to us, and He is also the power of God to us. This wisdom is actually God&rsquo;s plan to have Christ as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We need to know these things so that we can speak of Christ as power from God and as the wisdom of God and also as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. This is the word of wisdom.</p><h2 class="head2">The Word of Knowledge</h2>
<p>The first manifestation of the Spirit listed by Paul is the word of wisdom, and the second is the word of knowledge. The word of knowledge may be somewhat ordinary; it is not necessarily a word directly concerning Christ. For example, the word of knowledge may include the things related to salvation. Someone speaking a word of knowledge may speak of the parable in which the shepherd left the ninety-nine sheep and sought after the one sheep that was lost. Such a word is not a word of wisdom; it is a word of knowledge.</p>
<p>We need to study the Bible to learn the truths of the gospel and the truths of the spiritual life. This will make us knowledgeable and equipped to speak in the church meetings. This will also give us utterance. Utterance is related to our knowledge of the truth. If we do not have the knowledge of the truth, we may be able to shout forth some praise to the Lord, but we shall not have the utterance to speak of salvation or the Christian life.</p>
<p>All the saints need more knowledge of the truth and more ability to present the truth. This is the reason I have encouraged the leading ones to consider having a short time of training in the truth regularly after the prayer meeting and also after the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting. During this period of training, perhaps only a half hour in length, we can learn the truth and also practice presenting the truth. For instance, a brother may give a brief word in which he presents the truth of justification. We may know the truth concerning justification, but we still need to know how to present this truth to others. This is a matter of utterance.</p>
<p>Utterance equips us to speak the truth. When we have much utterance that comes from knowing the truth, we shall be able to speak for hours concerning the biblical truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Faith</h2>
<p>After the first two gifts, the word of wisdom and word of knowledge, Paul mentions certain miraculous gifts. &ldquo;To a different one faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing in the one Spirit.&rdquo; Faith here is like the faith that can remove mountains, as mentioned in 13:2 and Mark 11:22-24.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Gifts of Healing</h2>
<p>In verse 9 Paul also speaks of gifts of healing. This is the miraculous power for healing different diseases.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Works of Power</h2>
<p>In verse 10 we have yet another miraculous gift&mdash;operations of works of power. This refers to miracles, works of miraculous power other than healing. An example would be the case of Peter raising Dorcas from death (Acts 9:36-42).</p>
<p>I can testify that I prefer the gift of speaking the word of knowledge and the word of wisdom to the miraculous gifts. I admit that I do not have the kind of faith that can move mountains. However, I can speak the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. As a result of my study of the Scriptures, I can speak on many different subjects. To me, the most precious gifts are the gifts to speak a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge.</p>
<p>The miraculous gifts may stir up people&rsquo;s curiosity. But what people need is a word of wisdom to know Christ or a word of knowledge to know how to go on with the Lord.</p>
<p>Suppose that through the exercise of the gift of healing someone is healed of cancer. Although people may be excited by such a miracle, there may not be a genuine, long-lasting spiritual result. This is the reason the Lord Jesus did not commit Himself to those who were attracted by signs: &ldquo;Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, when they saw the signs which He did. But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men&rdquo; (John 2:23-24). The Lord did not commit Himself to those who were looking for miracles. Their persistent seeking after miracles eventually caused the Lord to go away from them.</p><h2 class="head2">Prophecy</h2>
<p>In 12:10 Paul speaks not only of operations of power, but also of prophecy, discerning of spirits, various kinds of tongues, and interpretation of tongues. Prophecy is miraculous only in part. The reason for this is that prophecy has more than one aspect. To prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God. Sometimes this speaking includes foretelling or predicting. Foretelling is miraculous, but speaking for God and speaking forth God are not miraculous.</p>
<p>Certain ones in the charismatic or Pentecostal movement like to hear predictions of the future. In 1963 and 1964 there were so-called prophecies that claimed that the city of Los Angeles would fall into the ocean. Those prophecies were even reported in the newspapers. However, those prophecies were not fulfilled.</p>
<p>The kind of prophesying I appreciate is the prophesying in which there is the speaking for the Lord and the speaking forth of the Lord. This prophesying is to speak to others concerning the Lord and also to speak out the Lord to them. This kind of prophesying is precious, and we all should learn to prophesy in this way.</p>
<p>In chapters twelve and fourteen of 1 Corinthians the noun &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo; and the verb &ldquo;prophesy&rdquo; are used a number of times. If we read these chapters carefully, we shall see that here Paul does not use these words mainly with the meaning of predict or foretell. Instead, in these chapters to prophesy is to speak forth, that is, to minister Christ to others. To prophesy is also to speak forth Christ. This prophesying is useful for edifying the individual saints and for building up the church corporately.</p>
<p>Many of us can testify of the help we have received through the kind of prophesying that speaks for Christ and speaks forth Christ. The church is built up through the speaking forth of Christ and the speaking for Christ. Furthermore, this kind of speaking is the dispensing of the Triune God. As someone is prophesying by speaking forth Christ and speaking for Christ, we are under the dispensing of the Triune God. As a result, we are nourished. This nourishment comes through the supply of the divine dispensing in prophesying. A brother may give a short testimony in a meeting, but that testimony may be a speaking forth of Christ and therefore a dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Our speaking provides the best opportunity for the Spirit to function, for the Lord to serve, and for God to work. Our speaking is the key to the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God into the church. When we are silent, dumb, the &ldquo;current&rdquo; of the heavenly electricity stops flowing. This causes the church to suffer. We all need to learn to speak so that there may be in all the church meetings the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Discerning of Spirits</h2>
<p>Discerning of spirits is the ability to distinguish the Spirit that is of God from those that are not of God (1 Tim. 4:1; 1 John 4:1-3). This gift is not miraculous.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Tongues and Interpretation of Tongues</h2>
<p>The last two gifts listed by Paul are various kinds of tongues and interpretation of tongues. Tongues in verse 10 denote a proper language or dialect (Acts 2:4, 6, 8, 11) either of men or of angels (1 Cor. 13:1), not meaningless voices or sounds. The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit, one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit. Some say that speaking in tongues is first the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit, but afterwards becomes a gift of the Spirit. According to this understanding, as the initial evidence, every believer must have the gift of tongues, but as a gift of the Spirit, every believer does not necessarily have it. However, this kind of teaching is groundless in the New Testament. The New Testament makes it more than clear that speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Spirit, and not all believers have it.</p>
<p>The interpretation of tongues is the gift to make the unknown tongues known, understandable (14:13). This is the ninth item of the manifestation of the Spirit listed in this chapter.</p><h2 class="head2">More Than Nine Items</h2>
<p>Although Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers is of more than nine items. A number of items are not included in these nine. The apostleship, helps, and administrations by the Spirit listed in verse 28, seeing visions and dreaming dreams by the Spirit as mentioned in Acts 2:17, the signs and wonders referred to in Hebrews 2:4, and three of the five miraculous acts prophesied in Mark 16:17-18 are not listed here. The apostle listed here only nine items of the Spirit&rsquo;s manifestation as an illustration. Of these nine, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are listed as the last two, because they are not as profitable as the other items for the building up of the church (14:2-6, 18, 19). Of these nine gifts and those listed in verses 28 through 30, prophecy as prediction, faith, gifts of healing, works of power, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues are miraculous. All the rest, a word of wisdom (like the word of the apostles), a word of knowledge (like the word of the teachers), and speaking for God and speaking forth God in prophecy by the prophets, discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations are gifts developed by the growth in life (3:6-7), as those listed in Romans 12:6-8, out of the inward, initial gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:7. The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life. The Corinthians did much speaking in tongues, yet they still remained in infancy (3:1-3). However, the gifts developed in life require growth in life, even maturity, for the building up of the church. It was for this purpose that this Epistle was written to them.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that Paul puts the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge as the first two and tongues and the interpretation of tongues as the last two. This indicates that Paul regarded the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge more highly than tongues and the interpretation of tongues. We may say that the best gift is the gift to speak for Christ and to speak forth Christ. The word of wisdom and the word of knowledge are related to this kind of speaking. Rather than the miraculous gifts, I encourage all the saints to seek the gift of speaking the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge and also the gift to speak for the Lord and the gift to speak forth the Lord.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MEMBERS<br />
IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:1, 3-11, 13, 18, 24, 28; 14:4-5, 12, 25; 15:3-4, 17, 20, 23, 45, 54-57</h1>
<h2 class="head1">DIFFERENT GIFTS PLACED IN THE CHURCH BY GOD</h2>
<p>In 12:28 Paul says, &ldquo;And God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; The church here refers both to its universal and local aspects. From verse 12 through 27 the church is considered the Body of Christ. The Body is an organism for Christ as the believers&rsquo; life to grow and express Himself. The church is an assembly for God to operate His administration.</p>
<p>The apostles are those who are called and sent by God (1:1; Rom. 1:1) to preach the gospel so that sinners may be saved to be the materials for the building of the church, to establish the churches (Acts 14:21-23), and to teach the divine truth. Their ministry is universal for all the churches.</p>
<p>The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God&rsquo;s revelation. Sometimes they may speak with inspired predictions (Acts 11:27-28).</p>
<p>The teachers are those who teach the truths according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching (Acts 2:42) and the prophets&rsquo; revelation. Both prophets and teachers are universal as well as local (Eph. 4:11; Acts 13:1).</p>
<p>Works of power denote miracles, works of miraculous power other than healing. An example of the works of power was the case of Peter raising Dorcas from death (Acts 9:36-42). Gifts of healing refer to miraculous power for healing different diseases.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;helps&rdquo; also means helpers or helpings. These must refer to the services of the deacons and deaconesses (1 Tim. 3:8-13).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;administrations&rdquo; also means administrators or governings. This should refer to the eldership in the church.</p>
<p>As the last of the items in 12:28, Paul lists various kinds of tongues. This is the second time that speaking in tongues is listed as the last of the aspects of God&rsquo;s operation in the church.</p>
<p>From 12:28 we clearly see that God has placed different gifts in the church. Actually, every member of the Body is a gift to the Body. Therefore, you should not think that others may be a gift but that you are not a gift. Even the small members of our physical body, such as our little fingers, are gifts to the body. If we did not have our little fingers, we certainly would sense a lack. All the members of the Body are gifts to the Body, and all are needed by the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In 14:4, 5, and 12 we see that the functions of the members are for the building up of the church. First Corinthians 14:4 and 5 say, &ldquo;He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church. Now I desire that you all speak in tongues, but rather that you may prophesy; now greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up.&rdquo; To prophesy, to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord, builds up not only the individual saints, but also the church.</p>
<p>In 14:12 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the church.&rdquo; The apostle is fully occupied with the consideration of building up the church. He is fully church-conscious and church-centered, altogether different from the self-centered Corinthians. Their problem with spiritual gifts was due to their self-seeking, to their not caring for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>In dealing with the problems in the realm of human life, Paul emphasizes Christ as God&rsquo;s unique portion to us. In dealing with problems in the realm of the divine administration, he emphasizes the church as God&rsquo;s unique goal for us. The Corinthians not only were devoid of Christ, but were also ignorant of the church. The apostle&rsquo;s completing ministry (Col. 1:25) comprises Christ as the mystery of God (Col. 2:2) and the church as the mystery of Christ (Eph. 3:4). However, the Corinthians missed both, even though they were under the apostle&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>In 14:25 Paul says, &ldquo;The secrets of his heart become manifest; and so falling on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is really among you.&rdquo; This implies that prophecy, speaking for God and speaking forth God with God as its content, ministers God to the hearers and brings them to God. This also indicates that the church meeting should be filled with God and that all its activity should convey God and transmit Him to people so that they may be infused with God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ of Many Members</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:11 and 12 say, &ldquo;But the one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one individually as He purposes. For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;For&rdquo; indicates that verse 12 is an explanation of verse 11. Verse 11 says that one Spirit operates all the various aspects of His manifestation, distributing them to many believers individually. This is just like our physical body being one and having many members.</p>
<p>In verse 12 Christ is &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo; in Greek. This refers to the corporate Christ, composed of Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body with all the believers as its members. All the believers of Christ are organically united with Him and constituted of His life and element to become His Body, an organism, to express Him. Hence, He is not only the Head, but also the Body. As our physical body has many members yet is one, so is this Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All Baptized into One Body<br />
and All Given to Drink One Spirit</h2>
<p>In 12:13 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, be this one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. It is in this one Spirit that we were all baptized into this one living Body to express Christ.</p>
<p>The believers of Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into Christ, the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3), the name&mdash;the Person&mdash;of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and the Body of Christ. Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ. All the gifts, as the manifestation of the Spirit distributed to the individual believers by the Spirit, are for the profit, the building up, of this Body. Paul is very conscious of this. He is very Body-conscious, Body-centered, unlike the Corinthians and so many other believers through the centuries who are very much self-centered concerning spiritual gifts. Hence, following this verse, he gives the Corinthians a long discourse concerning the Body. His intention is to rescue them from their self-seeking back to a concern for the Body so that they may be no longer for their individual profit but for the building of the Body.</p>
<p>In 12:13 &ldquo;Jews or Greeks&rdquo; refers to races and nationalities. &ldquo;Slaves or free&rdquo; refers to social ranks.</p>
<p>To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and be lost in Him. To drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and have our being saturated with Him. By these two procedures we are mingled with the Spirit. To be baptized in the Spirit is the initiation of the mingling and is once for all. To drink the Spirit is the continuation and accomplishment of the mingling and is perpetual, forever.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Having Placed<br />
the Members in the Body</h2>
<p>In verses 14 through 22 we see the indispensability of each member of the Body. In verse 18 Paul says, &ldquo;But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Having Tempered the Body Together</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 12:24 says, &ldquo;God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked.&rdquo; Literally, the Greek word rendered &ldquo;tempered&rdquo; means blended; hence, mixed, compounded, adjusted. God has blended all the different members of Christ together into one Body. We need much transformation (Rom. 12:2), from the natural life to the spiritual, by the same Spirit, for the practical Body life.</p>
<p>To be tempered together in the Body is to be blended, mingled. By this blending we have coordination, balance, and adjustment.</p>
<p>In the church life we have those of all colors, races, nationalities, and social rank. Nevertheless, we are one Body. How is this possible? It is possible through God&rsquo;s tempering of the members of the Body. Do you know how God tempers us together? He tempers us by the inner life and through His indwelling.</p>
<p>The placing of the gifts in the church and the tempering of the Body are matters of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The more God tempers us, the more He adjusts us and balances us, and the more He dispenses Himself into us. Balancing, adjusting, coordinating, tempering&mdash;all are related to the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>Whatever the Lord does in the Body is a matter of His dispensing. As we have strongly emphasized, this dispensing involves the Trinity, and it takes place through our cooperation. In particular we cooperate with the Triune God by our speaking in the meetings of the church. The more we speak, the more the divine dispensing takes place.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BASIC FACTOR</h2>
<p>In chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians we have all the functions of the members of the Body, and in chapter fourteen we see that the functions are for the building up of the church. Then in chapter fifteen we have what we may call the basic factor. This chapter does not speak of gifts or functions; however, it does reveal the basic factor of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Died for Our Sins</h2>
<p>In 15:3 Paul says, &ldquo;For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s death for our sins, His burial for our termination, and His resurrection for our germination with life, according to the prophecies of the Old Testament (Isa. 53:5-8, 10-12; Psa. 22:14-18; Dan. 9:26; Isa. 53:9; Psa. 16:9-10; Hos. 6:2), are the basic items among the first things of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Having Been Raised Up by God<br />
from among the Dead as the Firstfruit</h2>
<p>In 15:4 Paul continues, &ldquo;And that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&rdquo; The Scriptures in verses 3 and 4 denote the Old Testament, that is, the law and the prophets. Of the three matters mentioned here&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s death, His burial, and His resurrection&mdash;the last is the most vital, for it imparts life so that we may live Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 20 Paul says, &ldquo;But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; In verse 23 Paul again speaks of Christ as the firstfruit. Christ was the first One raised from among the dead as the firstfruit of resurrection. This was typified by the firstfruits (a sheaf of the firstfruits, including Christ with some of the dead Old Testament saints, was raised at the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;Matt. 27:52-53) in Leviticus 23:10-11, offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection (Matt. 28:1). Christ as the firstfruit of resurrection is the Firstborn from among the dead to be the Head of the Body (Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:20-23). Since He, the Head of the Body, has been resurrected, we, the Body, shall also be resurrected.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ as the Last Adam<br />
Having Become a Life-giving Spirit</h2>
<p>Chapter fifteen reveals not only that Christ died for our sins, that He was buried, and that He was resurrected to become the firstfruit. This chapter also reveals that Christ as the last Adam has become in resurrection a life-giving Spirit: &ldquo;So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Adam became a living soul through creation with a soulish body. Christ became a life-giving Spirit through resurrection with a spiritual body. Adam as a living soul is natural; Christ as a life-giving Spirit is resurrected. First, in incarnation, Christ became flesh for redemption (John 1:14, 29). Then in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit for imparting life (John 10:10). He had a soulish body like Adam through incarnation; He has a spiritual body through resurrection. His soulish body has become a spiritual one through resurrection. Now He is a life-giving Spirit in resurrection, with a spiritual body, ready to be received by His believers. When we believe into Him, He enters our spirit, and we are joined to Him as the life-giving Spirit. Hence, we become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). Our spirit is made alive and resurrected with Him. Eventually our present soulish body will also become a spiritual body in resurrection, just as His body is (vv. 52-54; Phil. 3:21).</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Giving Us the Victory<br />
through Our Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 15:57 Paul declares, &ldquo;But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This victory is the victory over sin and death. Such a victory by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection should not be merely an accomplished fact for our acceptance; it must also become our daily experience in life by the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, who is one with our spirit. Hence, we should live by this mingled spirit and walk according to it. Thus, many thanks will be continuously given to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Because we believe in Christ and participate in Him, we have an organic union with Him. As a result, we enjoy His victory over sin and death. We all have Christ as the firstfruit and as the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we may enjoy His victory. This makes it possible for us to function in the church meetings.</p>
<p>When we enjoy Christ&rsquo;s victory, we can speak for Christ and we can speak forth Christ in the meetings. This speaking opens the way for the Spirit to function, for the Lord to minister, and for God to work. Then the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity will take place continually, and the church will receive the benefit. This is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issuing in the functions of the members in a local church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MEMBERS<br />
IN A LOCAL CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 1:9, 30; 2:10-13; 3:6-7, 9, 12; 15:45b; 6:17; 12:3-6, 13</h1>
<p>We may read the Epistle of 1 Corinthians many times without understanding it. It is difficult to touch the essence of this Epistle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ESSENCE OF FIRST CORINTHIANS</h2>
<p>To help our understanding, we may compare the essence of 1 Corinthians to the essence of a tree. A tree has a trunk, branches, and leaves. These, however, are not the essence, or the extract, of the tree. Furthermore, we may know the element and substance of a tree and still not yet know its essence. The essence of a tree is its extract. Just as we may see the trunk, branches, and leaves without knowing the essence of a tree, so we may see the &ldquo;trunk,&rdquo; &ldquo;branches,&rdquo; and &ldquo;leaves&rdquo; of 1 Corinthians, but not be able to see the essence, the extract, of this book.</p>
<p>More than fifty years ago I made an outline of 1 Corinthians. When I reviewed that outline years later, I realized that I had touched only the branches and leaves of 1 Corinthians. I had not yet touched the element or substance, much less the essence, of this Epistle.</p>
<p>Some may think that there is no difference between the substance of a thing and its essence. But from the study of the Bible and the writings of certain great teachers, we have learned that there is a very important difference between substance and essence. You may touch the substance of a particular matter without touching its essence. Only when you touch the essence of a thing can you have the extract of that thing. First we have the element, then the substance, and finally the essence, the extract. In these messages we are endeavoring to touch the essence of Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians. Let us now consider the extract of this book.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLED INTO THE FELLOWSHIP OF GOD&rsquo;S SON<br />
AND PUT INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>In 1:9 Paul says, &ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; God has called us into the partaking of, the participation in, His Son. God has called us to partake of the all-inclusive Christ as our portion. To say that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son means that He has called us into the enjoyment of His Son. God has called us into the enjoyment of the living Christ. This enjoyment is not merely an individual matter; it is also a corporate matter. God has called us into the co-participation of the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>In order that we may enjoy Christ, God has put us into Christ. &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption&rdquo; (1:30). It is of God that we are in Christ. Christ is not only a sphere; He is also an element, substance, and essence. God has put us into this element, substance, and essence. Just as something may be put into water and then soak in the water, we have been put into Christ so that we may &ldquo;soak&rdquo; in Christ.</p>
<p>After putting us into Christ, God has made Christ His power and wisdom to us. According to 1:24, Christ is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom. For Christ to become wisdom and power to us actually means that He is dispensed into us. This dispensing can be compared to the flow of electricity from the power plant into the appliances in our homes. This flowing of the electricity is the dispensing of the electricity into the appliances. We have seen that God has called us into the participation of the enjoyment of Christ, the divine electricity. For this purpose, He has put us into this &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; and now is making this electricity our wisdom and power. This is a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head1">THE UNVEILING AND COMMUNICATING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Chapter two indicates that this dispensing takes place by the unveiling and communicating Spirit. In 2:9 and 10 Paul speaks of the unveiling Spirit: &ldquo;But even as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man&rsquo;s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him. But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&rdquo; How do we know that God has called us? How do we know that God has put us into Christ and that God is making Christ our power and wisdom? We cannot know these things by our mental ability. We can know them through the unveiling Spirit. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, God put His Spirit into us, and this Spirit is the unveiling Spirit.</p>
<p>When the Spirit functions as the unveiling Spirit, the Spirit removes the veils, the covers, that keep us from seeing Christ as our portion. If we have a sincere heart to seek the experience of Christ, the Spirit will continually reveal Christ to us. In our spirit the Spirit shows us the secrets of Christ as our portion.</p>
<p>In chapter two of 1 Corinthians, the Spirit is not only the unveiling Spirit but also the communicating Spirit. This is implied by Paul&rsquo;s word in verse 13: &ldquo;Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual things by spiritual things.&rdquo; The thought here is to speak spiritual things by spiritual words. The emphasis is not on the person to whom the speaking is addressed, but rather on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken. Paul speaks the spiritual things, which are the deep things of God concerning Christ, by the spiritual things, which are the spiritual words taught by the Spirit. This implies that the Spirit is the communicating Spirit.</p>
<p>The communicating of the Spirit involves transmitting. While the indwelling Spirit is unveiling the riches of Christ, He transmits these riches into our being.</p>
<p>Thus far, we have the extract of 1 Corinthians 1 and 2. This extract includes God&rsquo;s calling us into the enjoyment of Christ, God&rsquo;s putting us into Christ, God&rsquo;s making Christ wisdom and power to us, and the Spirit&rsquo;s revealing and communicating to us the things concerning Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH IN LIFE</h2>
<p>In chapter three we see the matter of the growth in life. In 3:6 and 7 Paul says, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow; so that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God.&rdquo; It is by the divine dispensing that God causes us to grow. He gives life and the growth in life through His dispensing. Eventually, through the growth in life we shall be transformed into precious materials for God&rsquo;s building. Concerning this, in 3:9 Paul tells us that we are God&rsquo;s farm, God&rsquo;s building. Then in verse 12 he goes on to speak of precious materials, of gold, silver, precious stones. In these verses we have the essence of chapter three.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>The unveiling and communicating Spirit within us is actually Christ Himself. First Corinthians 15:45 tells us that the last Adam, Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit. We who have been put into Christ by God have actually been joined to this wonderful Spirit. In 6:17 Paul says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We are joined to the Spirit, who is the resurrected Christ with the reality of His resurrection life. Now that we have been joined to Him to be one spirit with Him, we are one in essence with Him. We not only enjoy Him and not only have God&rsquo;s dispensing of Him into us as our power and wisdom so that we may have righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; we have actually been joined to the very Christ who is the life-giving Spirit with all the riches of resurrection. How marvelous!</p>
<p>What does it mean in a practical way to be one spirit with the Lord in our daily life? We all need much more experience of this. In recent years I have been endeavoring to practice to be one spirit with the Lord day by day. However, I must confess that I still do not have that much experience. Doctrinally, it may be rather easy to understand the meaning of being one spirit with the Lord. But it is another matter to experience this. We all need more practical experience of being one spirit with the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>In 15:3 and 4 Paul says, &ldquo;For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.&rdquo; Here we have Christ&rsquo;s death for our sins, His burial, and His resurrection. In resurrection Christ became the firstfruit, something full of life: &ldquo;But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep&rdquo; (v. 20). He was the first to be raised, and we shall follow Him. This means that we shall become new and full of life, just as He is.</p>
<p>As we have seen, in resurrection Christ became not only the firstfruit but also the life-giving Spirit. God has put us into Him, and we have been joined to Him. Now God is transmitting, dispensing, Him into us day by day. When we have this dispensing, we have victory and triumph. We are victorious, triumphant, over two basic enemies&mdash;sin and death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXTRACT OF FIRST CORINTHIANS</h2>
<p>If you consider all these verses from 1 Corinthians, you will see that this is the extract of this Epistle. In 1 Corinthians we see those who have been called by God into the enjoyment of His Son, who have been placed by God into Christ, who have Christ as wisdom and power, who have the indwelling Spirit unveiling and communicating the riches of Christ to them, who are experiencing God&rsquo;s dispensing for growth unto transformation, who are joined to Christ as one spirit, and who are triumphant over sin and death. As such persons, we need to function as members of the Body. We should not say that we do not have any spiritual gifts. On the contrary, we have a great deal with which to function.</p>
<p>We need to see from this book what kind of persons we are. We have been called into the enjoyment and participation of Christ. We have been put into Christ by God, and God has made Christ to be our wisdom and power. We have the Spirit in us to reveal the riches of Christ and communicate these riches to us. God is dispensing Himself into us as life so that we may grow in life and be transformed into precious materials for God&rsquo;s building. We are even one spirit with the Lord. Furthermore, in the resurrected Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit, we are triumphant over sin and death. Since God has made us such persons in Christ, we can function as members of the Body, and we must function.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING ABOUT CHRIST</h2>
<p>In order to function in the church meetings, we need to speak. By speaking we &ldquo;turn on the switch&rdquo; so that we may have the flowing of the divine electricity. In previous messages we have emphasized the fact that when we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers, and God operates. Then God&rsquo;s purpose is fulfilled.</p>
<p>As Christians in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to learn to speak all the time. We need to speak at home, on our way to work, and wherever we may be. By speaking in Christ we defeat the enemy and shut the door to evil things.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother, his wife, and children sit at the breakfast table in silence. No one says anything about the Lord or for the Lord. Then someone speaks carelessly about a certain matter. Others disagree with what is said, and eventually the brother and his wife become angry and have an argument.</p>
<p>How different the situation would be if someone would take the lead to speak concerning the Lord. Suppose the sister says, &ldquo;This morning I enjoyed 1 Corinthians 1:9, a verse that tells us that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son. How marvelous that we have been called into this fellowship.&rdquo; The husband may then reply, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Your word is a great help to me.&rdquo; This kind of speaking closes the door to the enemy and opens the door for the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>We all should redeem the time by taking every opportunity to speak about Christ. However, we are not accustomed to speaking about the Lord continually. Often the saints sit silently in the meeting hall waiting for the meeting to begin. Instead of speaking for the Lord or about the Lord, they may talk about other matters.</p>
<p>We need to speak the Lord, speak the Bible, speak God&rsquo;s salvation, and speak all manner of things concerning the Christian life. We Christians should be a speaking people, those who speak wherever they are.</p>
<p>I would suggest that we try to practice speaking even as we are driving to work. The traffic may be heavy, and it may cause you to become frustrated. Do you know why you feel that way? You are frustrated because you do not speak. If you speak concerning the Lord, your situation will be very different. Perhaps you may need to say, &ldquo;Car, I am not in you&mdash;I am in Christ!&rdquo; Then you should turn to the Lord, pray to Him, and praise Him. This kind of speaking brings in the Lord&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>As we speak for the Lord in the meetings, we should not only utter some praise to the Lord and declare how much we love Him; we also need to learn to speak with more aspects of the truth and with more of the Lord&rsquo;s riches,</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATURATED WITH THE SPIRIT TO SPEAK CHRIST</h2>
<p>In 12:13 Paul says, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; This verse reveals that Christ has baptized us in the Spirit into the Body, and now we all are drinking the one Spirit. On the one hand, Christ has put us into the Spirit. On the other hand, we are drinking this Spirit. Therefore, we are in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. The result is that we are soaked and saturated with this Spirit. This makes us fully qualified and able to function in the meetings by speaking for the Lord and even by speaking Him forth. Praise Him for the riches of the essence of the book!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE MATURITY OF LIFE AND<br />
CONSTITUTION OF MINISTRY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:3-5, 9, 12, 19-22</h1>
<p>In this message we shall begin to consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in 2 Corinthians. As we shall see, according to this book, the divine dispensing issues in the maturity of life and constitution of ministry.</p>
<p>Second Corinthians is much deeper than 1 Corinthians. For this reason, it is more difficult to understand.</p>
<p>The Epistle of 2 Corinthians is more experiential, more subjective, and deeper than the Epistle of 1 Corinthians. In 1 Corinthians, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, the church, and the gifts are covered as major subjects. In 2 Corinthians, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, and the church are further developed, but the gifts are not even mentioned. They are replaced in this book by the ministry, which is constituted of and produced and formed by the experiences of the riches of Christ through suffering, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross. The second Epistle gives us a pattern, an example, of how the killing of the cross works, how Christ is wrought into our being, and how we become the expression of Christ. These constitute the ministers of Christ and produce the ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant.</p>
<p>The first Epistle deals with the gifts; the second speaks about the ministry. The church needs the ministry much more than the gifts. The purpose of the ministry is to minister Christ whom we have experienced; the gifts are mostly to teach the doctrines concerning Christ. Not the gifts but the ministry produced and formed by the experience of the sufferings, the afflictions, of Christ, is the proof that the apostles are ministers of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE VICTORIOUS LIFE AND MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Chapters one and two of 2 Corinthians unveil a victorious life for maturity and a triumphant ministry for God&rsquo;s purpose. How can our life in Christ mature? How can a ministry be constituted within us? These questions are answered in 2 Corinthians.</p>
<p>All believers, even the youngest among us, have both life and ministry. However, among many Christians today there is the strong impression that not all believers are ministers. Some may say, &ldquo;I am not a pastor, a preacher, or a minister. I am a common Christian, and I don&rsquo;t have any ministry. Yes, I have received the divine life. But you should not say that I have a ministry. I have never studied theology, and I don&rsquo;t even have a full knowledge of the Bible. How could I have a ministry?&rdquo; This is a wrong understanding.</p>
<p>As long as we have life, we have a certain function. We may use our physical life as an illustration. Where there is life, there are the functions of life. This is true even of a newborn infant. The life in a baby makes it possible for him to cry, crawl, and eventually walk and speak. In a similar way, we all have received the divine life, a spiritual life, and with this life there is at least some amount of function. Therefore, since we have life, we all can function.</p>
<p>Although we have the divine life, there is the need for this life to mature. There is also the need for a ministry to be constituted within us. Both the maturing of life and the constituting of ministry depend upon the divine dispensing. The divine dispensing causes us to mature, and this dispensing also constitutes us with a divine ability so that we may function with a proper ministry. Therefore, both for our life and our ministry we need the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THROUGH SUFFERINGS AND ENCOURAGEMENT</h2>
<p>In the first chapter of 2 Corinthians we have the divine dispensing. Of course, the word &ldquo;dispensing&rdquo; is not used in this book. Nevertheless, as we shall see, the dispensing is included in Paul&rsquo;s word concerning the Father of compassions and the God of all encouragement; who encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God.</p>
<p>In verse 4 Paul speaks of his affliction, which denotes the suffering of persecution. All genuine Christians suffer persecution. Some have been persecuted by members of their family, their friends, or their neighbors. It is sovereign of the Lord that all genuine Christians suffer persecution. This suffering is an affliction. As Paul was traveling to preach the gospel, he was persecuted to the uttermost. Wherever he went, he was persecuted either by Jews or Gentiles. This suffering of persecution was his affliction.</p><h2 class="head2">Comforted by the God of All Encouragement</h2>
<p>In verse 3 Paul speaks of God as the Father of compassions and the God of all encouragement. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;compassions&rdquo; also means mercies, pity, sympathy. The word rendered &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; is different from the word for comfort or consolation and has the sense of cheer. Such a title as the Father of compassions and the God of all encouragement is ascribed here to God because this Epistle is one of comfort and encouragement. First we must experience the encouragement of God. Then we shall be able to encourage others with the encouragement we have experienced of God.</p>
<p>For many years I did not understand what Paul meant by encouragement in this chapter. Some versions render the Greek word for encouragement here as comfort. According to this translation, when we suffer persecution, God comforts us.</p>
<p>In our reading of the Bible, we should not take verses such as 1:3 and 4 for granted, assuming that we understand them. We need to ask ourselves what these verses mean. In particular, we need to ask what it means to say that God encourages us in all our affliction. How does God comfort us when we are suffering because of the name of the Lord Jesus?</p>
<p>I did not have a proper understanding of encouragement as described in this chapter until I came to realize that it is related to God&rsquo;s dispensing. We are comforted by God, encouraged by Him, through His dispensing. God is dispensing Himself into us, and this dispensing is His encouraging, His comforting.</p>
<p>I can testify from experience that the Triune God comforts and encourages us by dispensing Himself into us. During the years of the occupation of China by the invading Japanese army, I was imprisoned by the Japanese on two occasions. The first time was in 1938, when I was in prison for one night; the second was in 1943, when I was held in prison for one month. During my second imprisonment, twice a day I was subjected to a lengthy trial. I was threatened and severely ill-treated, and I was exhausted physically and mentally. Although I had done nothing wrong, I was being persecuted by the Japanese army. I was persecuted simply because I was a preacher who was bringing people to Christ, and the Japanese army did not like such a thing.</p>
<p>Out of fear that I would have contact with others who would spread information, I was kept in solitary confinement whenever I was not being tried. One night, after having suffered for days, as I was praying to the Lord, I said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, You know I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;m suffering not because I have done anything wrong, but because of You and Your gospel.&rdquo; I certainly would not say that I saw or touched the Lord physically. But I can testify that I experienced the Lord&rsquo;s presence in a remarkable way. It seemed to me that when I told the Lord that I was suffering for Him and His gospel, the atmosphere in the room changed. The Lord&rsquo;s presence was so real and intimate that I wept before Him. I knew that He was there with me. At that time I did not have the term &ldquo;divine dispensing,&rdquo; a term we have recently begun to use. Nevertheless, I truly experienced the divine dispensing. Through the Lord&rsquo;s dispensing, I was encouraged, comforted, and cheered. I was deeply at peace.</p>
<p>When I was in prison, I experienced the dispensing of the Lord into my being. That dispensing was His comforting. Therefore, I can testify that this comforting, this encouraging, is not a mere doctrine. The real encouragement is the dispensing of the divine riches into our being. Through that experience I eventually came to realize that the Lord&rsquo;s comforting is actually the dispensing of Himself into us to become our inward sustenance and support.</p>
<p>The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity can be compared to the flow of electricity from the power plant into our homes. As the current of electricity flows, the appliances in our homes receive the power for their operation. As the appliances operate, they continually receive the flowing, the dispensing, of electrical power into them. This is an illustration of the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God into us.</p><h2 class="head2">Comforting Others</h2>
<p>As indicated by the record in 2 Corinthians, while Paul and his co-workers were suffering for the sake of the gospel, the Triune God was dispensing Himself into them, and this dispensing became their comfort and encouragement. Furthermore, through their experience of being encouraged through the divine dispensing, they had the riches with which to comfort others. This was the reason Paul could say that they were &ldquo;able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God&rdquo; (1:4). Their comforting of others was also a matter of dispensing. As the apostles were comforting the saints, they were dispensing into them the riches of the Triune God that they themselves were enjoying.</p>
<p>In 1:5 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Because even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us, so through the Christ our encouragement also abounds.&rdquo; The sufferings here are not the sufferings for Christ, but Christ&rsquo;s own sufferings as shared by His disciples (Matt. 20:22; Phil. 3:10; Col. 1:24; 1 Pet. 4:13). &ldquo;The Christ&rdquo; in 2 Corinthians 1:5 is a designation of the condition of Christ, not a name (Darby). Here it refers to the suffering Christ, who suffered afflictions for His Body according to God&rsquo;s will. The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received encouragement.</p>
<p>In 1:3-5 Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;We were in affliction, but the God of all encouragement comforted us by dispensing Himself into us. Now we have the means to comfort others. Because we have experienced the divine riches, we can dispense the Triune God into others who are suffering for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. We enjoy the divine dispensing, and we also dispense into you the divine riches for your comfort and encouragement. If you enjoy this dispensing, you will also be able to dispense the riches into others who are suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is by the divine dispensing of the divine riches that the believers, including the apostles, grow toward maturity. Furthermore, it is by this dispensing that we are constituted of the divine essence in our ministry. The result is that we become victorious in life and triumphant in ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sentence of Death</h2>
<p>In 1:9 Paul says, &ldquo;But we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have confidence in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead.&rdquo; Literally, the Greek word rendered &ldquo;sentence&rdquo; means answer or response. When the apostles were under the pressure of affliction, despairing even of life, they may have asked themselves what the issue of their suffering would be. The answer, or response, was death.</p>
<p>The experience of death ushers us into the experience of resurrection. Resurrection actually is the very God who resurrects the dead. The working of the cross terminates the self so that we may experience God in resurrection. The experience of the cross always issues in the enjoyment of the God of resurrection. Such experience produces and forms the ministry (vv. 4-6). This is further described in 4:7-12.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Testimony of Our Conscience</h2>
<p>In verse 12 Paul says, &ldquo;For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.&rdquo; This verse indicates that we must have a pure conscience (2 Tim. 1:3), a conscience without offense (Acts 24:16), to bear testimony to what we are and do.</p>
<p>In verse 12 Paul speaks of the sincerity of God. This is a divine virtue, a virtue of what God is. To conduct ourselves in such a virtue means to experience God Himself. Hence, it equals the grace of God mentioned later in this verse.</p>
<p>Fleshly wisdom denotes human wisdom in the flesh. This equals us, just as the grace of God equals God Himself. The grace of God is God for our enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head1">THE UNCHANGING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In 1:19 and 20 Paul speaks concerning the unchanging Christ with God&rsquo;s promises in Him: &ldquo;For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you through us, through me and Sylvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes. For whatever promises of God there are, in Him is the Yes; wherefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us.&rdquo; &ldquo;For&rdquo; gives the reason for what is mentioned in the preceding verse. God is faithful, never changing, especially in His promises concerning Christ, so that the word the apostles preached concerning Christ is likewise never changing, because the very Christ whom God promised in His faithful word and whom they preached in their gospel did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes. Since the Christ whom they preached according to God&rsquo;s promises did not become yes and no, the word they preached concerning Him was not yes and no. Not only their preaching but also their living was according to what Christ is. They preached Christ and lived Him. They were not men of yes and no, but men who were the same as Christ.</p>
<p>Again in verse 20 &ldquo;For&rdquo; gives the reason for what is mentioned in the preceding verse. Christ, whom the faithful God promised and whom the sincere apostles preached, did not become yes and no; that is, He did not change. The reason Christ did not change is that in Him is the Yes of all the promises of God, and through Him is the apostles&rsquo; and the believers&rsquo; Amen to God for His glory.</p>
<p>In verse 20 Paul says that Christ is the Yes. Christ is the Yes, the incarnate answer, the fulfillment of all the promises of God to us.</p>
<p>The Amen in verse 20 is the Amen given by us through Christ to God (see 1 Cor. 14:16). Christ is the Yes, and we say Amen to this Yes before God. This is for the glory of God. When we say Amen before God to the fact that Christ is the Yes, the fulfillment, of all the promises of God, this is a glory to God through us.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;us&rdquo; in verse 20 refers not only to the apostles, who preached Christ according to God&rsquo;s promises, but also to the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles&rsquo; preaching. Through both there is glory for God when they say Amen to Christ as the great Yes of all God&rsquo;s promises.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE MATURITY OF LIFE AND<br />
CONSTITUTION OF MINISTRY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:3-5, 9, 12, 19-22; 2:14-16</h1>
<p>In this message we shall continue to consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in 2 Corinthians. This dispensing issues in the maturity of life and constitution of ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ATTACHED TO THE ANOINTED ONE</h2>
<p>In 1:21 Paul says, &ldquo;But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; Christ is the anointed One. Therefore, to be firmly attached to Christ is to be firmly attached to the anointed One. As the anointed One, Christ has the abundance of the rich Spirit, for He has been anointed by the compound Spirit. Now He is the Christ full of the Spirit, full of the ointment, and God has attached us all to Him.</p>
<p>The apostles, who preached Christ according to God&rsquo;s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles&rsquo; preaching, are joined to Christ. Because we have been joined to Christ, we have become one with Him, through whom we say Amen before God to the great Yes of God&rsquo;s promises, which is Christ Himself. But it is not of the apostles and believers themselves that they have been attached to Christ; it is of God who firmly attaches them all together to Christ. Their being one with Christ is of God and by God, not of themselves and by themselves.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;firmly attaches&rdquo; literally means establishes. This word can also be rendered &ldquo;firmly connects with.&rdquo; God establishes the apostles with the believers in Christ. This means that God attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, connecting the apostles and the believers to Christ, the anointed One. Hence, the apostles and the believers are one not only with Christ the anointed One, but also with one another, sharing together the anointing of Christ, which He has received of God.</p>
<p>In 1:21 we see that the One who firmly attaches us to Christ has also anointed us. Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God. We all have been attached to Christ. As electricity is connected to a building, we all have been connected to Christ. When we were saved, we were attached, connected, to Him. Do you know why we are sometimes beside ourselves with joy in the Lord? It is because we have been attached to Christ, and because we have been attached to Him, we are also anointed. Christ is an anointed Person, a Person fully &ldquo;painted&rdquo; with the divine paint. Whenever we contact Him, we are anointed, &ldquo;painted&rdquo; with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEAL AND THE PLEDGE</h2>
<p>In 1:22 Paul goes on to say that God &ldquo;has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.&rdquo; The anointing in verse 21 is the sealing. Because God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him. To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&rsquo;s image signified by the seal, thus making us like God.</p>
<p>In verse 22 Paul also says that God has given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge. Sealing is a mark that we are God&rsquo;s inheritance, God&rsquo;s possession. The pledge is a guarantee that God is our inheritance or heritage belonging to us. The Spirit within us is the pledge, an earnest of God being our portion in Christ.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;pledge&rdquo; also means a foretaste, guarantee, token down payment guaranteeing the full payment, a partial payment in advance. Because we are God&rsquo;s inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us. Because God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge of this inheritance to us. God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God. This affords us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance that is coming.</p>
<p>In the purchase of land in ancient times, the seller would give the buyer some soil from that land as a sample. This sample was called by the Greek word for pledge. Hence, according to ancient Greek usage, a pledge is also a sample. The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God in full.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s attaching us to Christ issues in three things: an anointing that imparts God&rsquo;s elements into us, a sealing that forms the divine elements into an impression to express God&rsquo;s image, and a pledging that gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God. Through these three experiences of the anointing Spirit, along with the experience of the cross, the ministry of Christ is produced and constituted.</p>
<p>In 1:22 Paul tells us that the pledge of the Spirit is in our hearts. Because this pledge is in our hearts, it becomes part of our consciousness. Now we may be conscious of the fact that the Spirit is within us as a pledge.</p>
<p>The Spirit as the earnest of God being our portion is a foretaste to us. Hence, Paul says that He is in our hearts. Romans 5:5 and Galatians 4:6 refer to the matter of love. Hence, they speak of the Spirit in our heart. But Romans 8:16 refers to the work of the Spirit, because this verse says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. Our heart is a loving organ, but our spirit is a working organ.</p><h2 class="head1">GROWING THROUGH THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>The anointing, the sealing, and the pledging are all a matter of the divine dispensing. The indwelling Spirit is doing the work of dispensing. As we are anointed with the Spirit, we experience the dispensing of the Spirit into us. Furthermore, the sealing and the pledging, which guarantees, assures, and cheers us, are also related to God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<p>Through the experience of the dispensing in the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging, we grow in life. We not only receive the element and substance of the divine life, but we also receive the essence of the divine life. Now we are growing through the dispensing of the essence of the Triune God into our being. We do not grow in life through doctrine. Rather, we grow through the divine essence that is being dispensed into us day by day. Only through the divine dispensing do we have real, actual, and practical growth unto maturity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>The anointing, sealing, and pledging of the Holy Spirit in the divine dispensing also lead to the real, actual, and practical constitution of a ministry within us. Concerning this ministry, we all need to practice speaking for the Lord. We should speak not only in the church meetings but also at home. We all need to be prepared, exercised, and trained to speak for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CAPTIVES AND INCENSE-BEARERS</h2>
<p>In 2:14 Paul says, &ldquo;But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.&rdquo; Here Paul uses the metaphor of a triumphal procession. Often after a general of the Roman army had won a victory, he would march through the capital with his captives in a procession to celebrate his victory. Paul used this metaphor to illustrate how Christ is the victorious general and how Paul and all believers are His captives. Christ is leading a triumphal procession of His captives to celebrate His victory.</p>
<p>The Greek verb rendered &ldquo;leads us in triumph&rdquo; as used in 2:14 means &ldquo;to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession; the full phrase means to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ...God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul (who had been so great an opponent of the gospel) is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession, yet (at the same time, by a characteristic change of metaphor) an incense-bearer, scattering incense (which was always done on these occasions) as the procession moves on. Some of the conquered enemies were put to death when the procession reached the Capitol; to them the smell of incense was an odor of death unto death; to the rest who were spared, an odor of life unto life&rdquo; (Conybeare). God always leads the apostles in such a triumphant way for their ministry. God&rsquo;s leading is His dispensing of Himself into the apostles. In their ministry God dispenses the virtues of Christ in His Person and work into them in triumph, and their ministry is a procession celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>In 2:12 through 7:16 Paul speaks about the ministry of himself and his co-workers. He first likens their ministry to a celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory. Their move in their ministry for Christ is like a triumphal procession from one place to another under God&rsquo;s leading. He and his co-workers are Christ&rsquo;s captives, bearing the fragrant incense of Christ, for His triumphant glory. They have been conquered by Christ and have become His captives in the train of His triumph, scattering the fragrance of Christ from place to place. This is their ministry for Him.</p>
<p>As conquered and captured ones in the train of Christ&rsquo;s triumph, Paul and his co-workers celebrated and participated in Christ&rsquo;s triumph. The apostles were such captives; their move as captives of Christ in their ministry for Him was God&rsquo;s celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory over His enemies.</p>
<p>As we have pointed out, as captives in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession, Paul and his co-workers were also incense-bearers, scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry as in a triumphal procession. The apostles were such incense-bearers in the ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph.</p>
<p>In 2:14 Paul speaks of the savor of the knowledge of Christ. &ldquo;According to the Greek usage, savor and knowledge are in apposition, so that the knowledge of Christ is symbolized as an odor communicating its nature and efficacy through the apostle&rsquo;s work&rdquo; (Vincent).</p><h2 class="head1">SPREADING THE FRAGRANCE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In 2:15 and 16 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing: to the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.&rdquo; The apostles, being permeated with Christ, became a fragrance of Christ to God. They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God, both in those who were being saved, as a savor from life to life, and in those who were perishing, as a savor from death unto death.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;unto&rdquo; in verse 16 means resulting in. Therefore, &ldquo;unto death&rdquo; means resulting in death, and &ldquo;unto life&rdquo; means resulting in life. This refers to the different effects of the apostles&rsquo; ministry upon different persons. It is a matter of life and death! Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this (3:5-6).</p>
<p>As captives and incense-bearers, the apostles scattered incense. To some, this incense was unto death; to others, it was unto life. Therefore, these incense-bearers became a savor from life to life and from death to death. This is a description of Paul&rsquo;s ministry.</p>
<p>In his preaching of the gospel, Paul was spreading abroad the fragrance of Christ. Whenever we speak Christ, this speaking is the spreading of the sweet fragrance of Christ. Paul also says that this is a sweet fragrance to God. This means that when we speak Christ to others, in our speaking the fragrance of Christ ascends to God for His enjoyment. Furthermore, to some, to those who are God&rsquo;s chosen ones, this fragrance will be life; however, to others this fragrance will be death. Whenever we speak Christ to others, we need to realize that our speaking is the spreading of the sweet fragrance of Christ. While we are speaking, God is enjoying this fragrance.</p>
<p>I doubt that many of us have realized that when we speak forth the riches of Christ in the meetings, we are spreading Christ as a sweet fragrance. God enjoys this fragrance, for He is happy to be able to enjoy our speaking of Christ.</p>
<p>We have seen that in chapter two Paul says that God is always leading us in triumph in the Christ and manifesting through us the savor of the knowledge of Him. This is to speak Christ with our spiritual knowledge. Furthermore, the apostles were a fragrance of Christ to God because they were saturated and permeated by Christ and with Christ. Because they were permeated in this way, they became the fragrance of Christ to God. When they spoke to others, the very Christ of whom they were constituted spread Himself forth out from their being. Because they were full of Christ, they became the fragrance of Christ. When they spoke, the Christ of whom they were constituted came forth as a sweet fragrance to God for His enjoyment.</p>
<p>This should also be our experience today. While we are speaking Christ, He should come forth as a sweet fragrance out from our being. God enjoys this fragrance. Once again, this is a matter of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>From experience we know that whenever we give a genuine testimony for the Lord, we are the first to enjoy this testimony. After the meeting we may be filled with praise to the Lord. However, we also know what it is like inwardly when we do not obey the inner sense to speak for the Lord in the meeting. In such a case, we may feel deeply disappointed and deadened. What a difference it makes to speak for the Lord in the meetings!</p>
<p>Some saints may not speak because they are afraid of saying something wrong. Do not be held back by this. Sometimes we are happy in the Lord even though we may have made some kind of mistake in our speaking, for we still spread forth Christ in our testimony.</p>
<p>We have seen that God has attached all of us firmly to Christ. We have been linked to Christ, and Christ has been linked to us. Furthermore, Christ is one with the Spirit, and the Spirit is one with God. Therefore, the Triune God is joined to us. Now when we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God operates.</p>
<p>Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity we can mature in life and triumph in our ministry. We all can have a triumphant ministry. When we open our mouths to speak for Christ, we shall be triumphant. We can allow Christ to spread His sweet fragrance to God for His enjoyment. This fragrance will also have an effect on others, either to life or to death. All this takes place by God&rsquo;s dispensing, by the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our being.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE MATURITY OF LIFE AND<br />
CONSTITUTION OF MINISTRY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 2:14-16; 3:3, 18; 4:6-7</h1>
<p>Many readers of the Bible pay close attention to the book of 1 Corinthians but not nearly as much attention to the book of 2 Corinthians. In 1 Corinthians Paul speaks concerning Christ as our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Readers of the Bible may consider these matters in a superficial way. Furthermore, in 1 Corinthians at least ten problems in the church life are covered. Also, in 1 Corinthians 12 Paul speaks about spiritual gifts, including healing, miracles, and tongue-speaking. It is easy for readers of the New Testament to be curious about such things.</p>
<p>It is not nearly as easy for readers of the Bible to become interested in 2 Corinthians as in 1 Corinthians. The reason is that 2 Corinthians is a much deeper book.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIVE METAPHORS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Captives</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians Paul uses a number of metaphors to describe the Christian life and ministry. The first of these metaphors is that of captives in the train of Christ&rsquo;s victorious procession: &ldquo;But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place&rdquo; (2:14). Paul was a captive of Christ, one captured, subdued, and fully gained by Christ and then put into His train of victorious procession.</p>
<p>Many readers of the New Testament have no knowledge of the metaphor used in 2:14. But we may have the knowledge of this metaphor and yet not have much inner realization concerning its application. We may not have the realization, the sense, that we have been captured, subdued, possessed, and fully gained by Christ, the Victor, and that now we are captives in the train of His victorious procession. If we have an inward realization concerning this matter, it will make us a different kind of person. We shall always be conscious of the fact that we have been captured by Christ, subdued by Him, and gained by Him. In relation to ourselves, therefore, we are nothing. A captive is one who is now absolutely for the one who has conquered him. He knows that now he is one of those marching in the train of the victorious procession of the one who has captured him. This was Paul&rsquo;s thought in 2:14.</p>
<p>Often after a Roman general had won a victory in battle, he would return to the capital leading a train of captives. The triumphal procession of the captives celebrated the general&rsquo;s victory. All the captives in the procession were for the celebration of the victory of the triumphant general. How many Christians today are like this in relation to Christ? How many of us have the consciousness of being a captive in the train of Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession? I do not believe that many of us have this realization. If we were conscious of this fact, we would not be able to exchange words with our husband or wife. How could a captive in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession exchange words? A captive has nothing to say. We all need to realize in a practical way that we are captives in Christ&rsquo;s procession. Such a realization will certainly change us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Incense-bearers</h2>
<p>In 2:14-16 we see that those who are captives in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession are also incense-bearers manifesting the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place. In 2:15-16a Paul says, &ldquo;For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing: to the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.&rdquo; In these verses we have two metaphors: captives and incense-bearers. Because we are captives in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession, we are also incense-bearers, those who scatter incense wherever we go. Because we have been captured, subdued, possessed, and gained by Christ, He has the liberty to saturate us with His fragrance. As a result, we become a savor spreading His sweet fragrance. The metaphor of the incense-bearer illustrates this. As captives of Christ, we are being saturated with His fragrance. In this way, the captives in His procession become incense-bearers.</p><h2 class="head2">Letters</h2>
<p>In 3:2 and 3 Paul uses the metaphor of a letter: &ldquo;You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men; being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.&rdquo; Here we see that those under the ministry of the apostles are letters composed by the apostles. These letters are composed with the Spirit of the living God, with the life-imparting and life-dispensing Spirit. The God that Paul served is the living God, and He is now the dispensing Spirit.</p>
<p>We should not regard the Spirit as being separate from God. In 3:17 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; In the same verse Paul also speaks of the Spirit of the Lord. The Spirit is the Lord, and the Lord is the Spirit. In like manner, the Spirit of the living God is actually the living God Himself. When Paul says that the apostles inscribed a letter with the Spirit of the living God, this does not mean that the Spirit of the living God is only the Spirit and not God Himself. No, the Spirit of the living God is God. The living God is the Triune God, the One who has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and has now been consummated in the life-giving, life-imparting, and life-dispensing Spirit. With this Spirit the apostles inscribed upon the saints to make them a letter of Christ written by them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Mirrors</h2>
<p>In 3:18 Paul goes on to indicate that we are mirrors: &ldquo;And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;beholding and reflecting as a mirror&rdquo; translate a single word in Greek. Here we have the beholding, the reflecting, and a mirror. Beholding is to see the Lord for ourselves; reflecting is for others to see Him through us. A mirror reflects what it beholds. As a mirror beholds, it reflects what it beholds. We are mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p>In order to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, we need to be unveiled. Our face should be fully unveiled so that we may see clearly and reflect properly. Formerly, we were veiled. But now, through the ministry of the apostles, the veil has been taken away. As those with an unveiled face, we can behold Christ and reflect Him. While we are beholding and reflecting, we are being transformed by the divine dispensing of the divine element into our inner being. We are being transformed from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Vessels</h2>
<p>In 4:7 Paul says, &ldquo;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&rdquo; Here we have another metaphor&mdash;vessels. God&rsquo;s shining, which is God&rsquo;s dispensing, in our hearts (4:6) brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in these worthless vessels. This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the new covenant with a priceless ministry. This is by the divine power in resurrection. The excellence of this power is surely of God and not of us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Experiencing the Significance of These Metaphors</h2>
<p>We have seen that in the apostles&rsquo; speaking concerning their ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant, five very significant and expressive metaphors are used to illustrate how they, as the ministers of the new covenant, and their ministry are constituted, how they behave and live, and how their ministry is carried out. The first metaphor is that of captives in a triumphant procession for the celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory (2:14a), then incense-bearers to scatter the fragrance of Christ (2:14b-16), letters written with Christ as the content (3:1-3), mirrors beholding and reflecting the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image (3:18), and finally earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure (4:7). These vessels may be compared to a camera, into which the image of Christ enters through the illumination of God&rsquo;s shining (4:4, 6).</p>
<p>The reason Paul uses metaphors in 2 Corinthians is that the things he is ministering to us are very rich, deep, and experiential. Ordinary words are not adequate to speak of them; it is necessary to use metaphors.</p>
<p>We need to be impressed with the significance of these metaphors. First, we need to have the consciousness that we are captives of Christ and also His incense-bearers, those bearing Him as incense. We should not simply work for Him, but should spread abroad the sweet fragrance of Christ. We also need to realize that we are letters written with the divine ink of the Triune God. Moreover, we are mirrors beholding and reflecting Christ and vessels containing Him. How marvelous! We need to consider these metaphors again and again, for they illustrate things that are deep, profound, and experiential. We need to experience all the matters indicated by these five metaphors.</p><h2 class="head1">LIFE AND MINISTRY</h2>
<p>We have briefly considered five metaphors used by Paul in 2 Corinthians. Now we need to consider what is the issue, the result, of the experience pictured by these metaphors. The issue is constitution in life.</p>
<p>We have received the divine life, and God&rsquo;s intention is to work this life into our entire being. When we were regenerated, God wrought this life into our spirit. Now God is seeking to spread His life from our spirit, the center of our being, into our soul and even into our body. We may compare our spirit to the hub of a wheel, and our body to the rim. God has wrought His life into our spirit as the &ldquo;hub,&rdquo; and now He is spreading this life through the &ldquo;spokes&rdquo; of the soul to the &ldquo;rim&rdquo; of the body. Then the entire &ldquo;wheel&rdquo; will be saturated and permeated with the divine life. This is what it means to say that we are constituted of life. Chapters two, three, and four of 2 Corinthians speak of such a constitution of life. Throughout the centuries, the majority of believers have failed to see the matter of constitution of life.</p>
<p>This constitution of life is also the constitution of the ministry. We should not think that we only need the constitution of life and do not need the constitution of the ministry. Every believer needs both the constitution of life and the constitution of the ministry. Every believer has life, and every believer should share in the ministry. This is the reason we encourage all the saints to function in the meetings. To function is to carry out our ministry.</p>
<p>Ministry is equal to service. Therefore, to minister is to serve. We may carry out our ministry by giving a testimony or by praying. As we testify and pray, we minister to those in the meeting. Sometimes a prayer renders more service than a testimony does. Do not think that you have no ministry. Speaking, testifying, and praying are all aspects of the ministry.</p>
<p>Ministry requires constitution. Just as our spiritual life needs a constitution, so our ministry also needs a constitution. Actually, we cannot separate ministry, or function, from life. Life always functions. There is no such thing as a kind of life that does not function. We may use a fruit tree as an illustration. As a fruit tree grows, it will blossom and bear fruit. However, if a fruit tree does not grow, it will not function. If it does not grow, it will not blossom or bear fruit. We may say that the blossoming and fruit-bearing of a fruit tree is its function, its ministry. Do you know what fruit trees are doing as they are growing? They are functioning, ministering. But apart from growth, fruit trees cannot minister.</p>
<p>Growth indicates life, and life needs to reach maturity. The more we mature, the greater will be our measure of life. The greater our measure of life is, the more we shall be able to function.</p>
<p>Suppose a certain brother learns the Bible only in a doctrinal way without growing in life. What kind of function will he have? His only function will be to teach the Bible in a theological way. He will not be able to function as a captive in Christ&rsquo;s procession or as His incense-bearer. Furthermore, he will not be able to function by writing letters of Christ. Since he does not have the growth in life, he does not have the function that depends on life. This illustrates the crucial point that we cannot separate ministry from life.</p>
<p>You should not say, &ldquo;I am not an apostle or an elder. Since I am neither an apostle or an elder, my only need is for life; I do not need to have a ministry.&rdquo; On the contrary, you need to have both life and ministry, and in these three chapters both life and ministry are covered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSTITUTION AND TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>In these chapters of 2 Corinthians, we see not only the matter of constitution but also the matter of transformation. In 3:18 Paul clearly speaks of our being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.</p>
<p>Constitution is a matter of having a certain element transfused into us. We may use as an illustration the petrification of wood. How can wood be petrified? Wood is petrified through a process of constitution. In this process certain mineral elements are deposited into the wood through the flowing of water. This transfusing, this infusing, of mineral elements into the wood is constitution. Moreover, in the petrification of wood, the water carries away the old element and replaces it with a new element.</p>
<p>The petrification of wood illustrates the process of being constituted of the divine life. As the current of living water flows within us, it deposits the divine element into us. Furthermore, as the water flows through us and out of us, it carries away our &ldquo;wooden&rdquo; element. Through the flowing of the water, the element of the divine &ldquo;minerals&rdquo; replaces the element of wood. The result is a metabolic constitution. By metabolic we mean a process in which an old element is replaced by a new element. When we speak of constitution, we speak of the process of spiritual metabolism that affects us intrinsically by a divine life-replacement.</p>
<p>What, then, is transformation? Transformation denotes a change. When wood is petrified, it undergoes a change as the old element is carried away and is replaced by a new element. This change affects the wood inwardly, and it also affects its form outwardly. Hence, it is a matter of transformation.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;transform&rdquo; includes the word &ldquo;form.&rdquo; For something to be transformed means that it changes from one form into another form. Therefore, transformation implies a new kind of formation. Transformation is not only a matter of constitution; it is also a matter of building up a particular form. In 3:18 this form is Christ&rsquo;s image. In this verse Paul tells us that we are being transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>As Paul was writing these three chapters of 2 Corinthians, he had within him the thoughts of constitution and transformation. If not, he would not have written these chapters in the way he did.</p>
<p>We cannot understand chapters two, three, and four of 2 Corinthians simply by reading them. We can understand these chapters only after we have had a certain amount of spiritual experience. The degree of our understanding depends on the extent of our experience. Our experience of these matters is not yet adequate. This is why it is difficult for us to speak concerning them. We must have experience in order to understand experiential things. Only then shall we be able to present these things to others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RESPONDING TO THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>Both constitution and transformation take place through the divine dispensing. From the time we were regenerated, the divine dispensing has been going on within us. The rate of this dispensing, whether fast or slow, depends on our response. In other words, it depends on our cooperation. If we cooperate with the divine dispensing, it will go on swiftly and will work effectively. But, sorry to say, after being regenerated, we have not responded fully to the divine dispensing. Nevertheless, we have responded to it to some extent, and we have cooperated with it at least a little.</p>
<p>In these three chapters of 2 Corinthians Paul is seeking to portray the dispensing of the divine element into our tripartite being. This dispensing is to produce constitution and transformation so that we may have maturity in life and also a measure of ministry.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 3:3, 6, 8-9, 17-18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A LETTER OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In 3:3 Paul says, &ldquo;Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.&rdquo; Here a letter of Christ does not mean a letter written by Christ; rather, this letter is a composition that uses Christ as the alphabet. A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey Christ and express Him. All believers of Christ should be such living letters of Christ so that others may read and know Christ in their being.</p>
<p>A letter of Christ is composed using Christ as the words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs. From first to last, Christ is every part of such a letter. Therefore, a letter of Christ speaks Christ, for every part of the letter expresses Him. We all should be letters of Christ expressing Him.</p>
<p>According to 3:3, the letter of Christ was written by the ministry of the apostles. The apostles were filled with Christ so that their ministry spontaneously ministered Christ to those whom they contacted, inscribing Christ in their hearts and making them living letters conveying Christ.</p>
<p>In verse 3 Paul says that a letter of Christ is not inscribed with ink, but inscribed with the Spirit of the living God. The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, like a pen for writing, but is the very element, like the ink in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.</p>
<p>A living letter of Christ is written not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart. Our heart, as the composition of our conscience (the leading part of our spirit), mind, emotion, and will, is the tablet upon which the living letters of Christ are written with the living Spirit of God. This implies that Christ is written into every part of our inner being with the Spirit of the living God to make us His living letters, so that He may be expressed through us and read by others in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WRITING CHRIST ON OTHERS</h2>
<p>Some of the saints may think that because they are not apostles, they cannot participate in writing a living letter of Christ. We should not hold this concept. Through our daily preaching of the gospel, we can write Christ on others. Do you know what it is to preach the gospel? To preach the gospel is to write a living letter. Gospel preaching is a matter of letter writing.</p>
<p>We have seen that in chapter two Paul uses the metaphors of captives in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession and incense-bearers scattering incense. As you contact people at work, you should be a captive of Christ bearing Him and spreading Him as incense. On the one hand, preaching the gospel is a matter of writing Christ on others; on the other hand, it is a matter of scattering Christ as incense. In either case, this kind of gospel preaching is related to our own experience of the gospel.</p>
<p>If we do not have the experience of the gospel, our preaching of the gospel will not be effective. We may only be able to speak to others in a doctrinal way concerning God, Christ, and salvation.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother who has little experience of the gospel tries to convince a fellow worker that there is only one God. This brother&rsquo;s fellow worker may say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you! You say there is only one God, but I believe that there are many gods. Don&rsquo;t try to tell me there is only one God!&rdquo; The brother is defeated by this unbeliever because his preaching of the gospel is a preaching without the experience of the gospel.</p>
<p>Let us also suppose that this same brother tries to tell another colleague at work that Jesus Christ is the Savior. However, once again he is defeated by the other party who says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that Jesus Christ is the Savior. I believe that I can be saved without Jesus.&rdquo; Although the brother attempted to preach the gospel, his preaching was not effective.</p>
<p>The proper preaching of the gospel depends on our measure of life and on our experience of God and Christ. Suppose a brother with a considerable amount of experience of God and Christ speaks to a fellow worker concerning God. This brother will not preach to his fellow worker, trying to convince him that there is one God. Instead, he may give him a testimony of his experience and of how he came to believe in God and receive Christ as his Savior. He will testify of something living and real that came into him and changed him. Surely, this brother&rsquo;s fellow worker will enjoy hearing this kind of testimony.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such a testimony infuses others, convinces them, and subdues them. There is no need for you to preach to your fellow workers by saying, &ldquo;Everyone is a sinner, and you are not an exception. You are a sinner, and you need to be saved.&rdquo; Instead of preaching in this way, you should infuse him day by day with your testimony. This is the experiential way to preach the gospel. This way is a matter of infusing into others what we have enjoyed of God and Christ. Even though your fellow worker may not mentally accept what you tell him, through your experiential preaching of the gospel the element of God and of Christ will be infused into him.</p><h2 class="head1">INFUSING OTHERS WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Our preaching of the gospel depends on how much we have experienced of the Lord and how much we have enjoyed Him. If we have experienced and enjoyed the Lord to a considerable degree, we shall surely have a sufficient measure of life. Then what we say to others concerning God, Christ, and salvation will not merely be a doctrine or theory. On the contrary, through our speaking we shall infuse others with the elements of God, Christ, and salvation.</p>
<p>To infuse others with the elements of God, Christ, and salvation is to write Christ into their being with the divine Spirit as the spiritual ink. Day by day, we may write Christ upon the hearts of those with whom we come in contact. Their being is a soft &ldquo;tablet&rdquo; that absorbs the &ldquo;ink&rdquo; of the Spirit.</p>
<p>I believe that if we have an adequate measure of life and experience of Christ, after a period of time some of our co-workers will be saved. To be sure, if we write on them continuously, day by day, for several months or even a year, much of the element of Christ and His salvation will be written on them. As a result, eventually they will believe and be saved. This is the proper gospel preaching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY</h2>
<p>In Acts 1:8 the Lord says that we shall be His witnesses. He does not say in this verse that we shall be preachers. The experiential preaching of the gospel based on our enjoyment of the Lord is actually the testimony of a witness. Through experiencing the Lord Jesus, we become His living witnesses. Therefore, our gospel preaching is not merely preaching; it is a testifying.</p>
<p>Day by day we may testify to our fellow workers. We testify to them not by presenting ideas, concepts, theories, and doctrines; instead, we testify by letting them know how real and precious the Lord is to us and how much we enjoy Him. Then what we speak to others concerning the Lord will be our testimony. Such preaching definitely depends on our life experience.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul preached the gospel in this experiential way. For this reason, in chapter two of 2 Corinthians he portrays himself as a captive in Christ&rsquo;s triumphal procession. As one in the ministry, Paul was a captive of Christ. Simultaneously, as a captive in Christ&rsquo;s train, Paul was an incense-bearer scattering the fragrance of Christ.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul changes the metaphor from that of captives and incense-bearers to that of a letter writer. In addition to being a captive and a bearer of incense, Paul was also one who wrote upon those who received his ministry. As a result, they became letters written by him.</p>
<p>What did Paul write on those who received his ministry? He wrote Christ on them. Christ was every word, phrase, and sentence written upon their hearts through his ministry. The &ldquo;ink&rdquo; used by Paul was the Spirit of the living God.</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel without the adequate measure of life and experience may be compared to trying to write with a pen that has no ink. But if we speak to others according to our experience and enjoyment of the Lord, we shall write upon them with the Spirit, for the Spirit is actually the element of our experience. Our experience of Christ is constituted mainly of the Spirit. Therefore, when we speak to others of our experience, the ink of the Spirit will flow. However, if we only study the Bible in a doctrinal way or learn theology but do not have experience, we shall not have the ink of the Spirit with which to write Christ upon others.</p>
<p>If we try to speak for the Lord without experiencing Him, our speaking will be dry, lacking the divine ink. But if we speak something that is according to our experience, we shall realize that while we are speaking the ink of the Spirit is flowing. Furthermore, through our speaking, the ink will be applied to those who are listening.</p>
<p>As those who would compose letters of Christ, we do not use mere theological knowledge or philosophy as the elements of our composition. Rather, we compose with Christ and His redemption, and we write with the ink of the living Spirit. Then as we minister, others are impressed with Christ.</p>
<p>Paul wrote upon others in this way, and we should do the same thing today. In the meetings, as we give a testimony or offer a prayer, we may write Christ upon others with the ink of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">DISPENSING AND CONSTITUTING</h2>
<p>The writing of living letters of Christ is a matter of both dispensing and constituting. With respect to the one doing the writing, it is a matter of dispensing. But with respect to the one being written upon, it is a matter of constituting, a constituting that takes place through the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you speak to a fellow worker day by day concerning the Lord in an experiential way. As we have seen, this experiential preaching is your writing of Christ into that person with the Spirit as the ink. On your side, your testifying is a matter of dispensing. On the side of the other party, it is a matter of being constituted through this dispensing. After a period of time, a particular constitution will be built up in that person, and then he will be ready to be saved. This is the way to preach the gospel in the recovery.</p>
<p>We should dispense Christ into others. This dispensing will then become a constitution within them. Eventually, they will be able to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, I&rsquo;m saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to preach the gospel in the way of writing Christ into others with the life-giving Spirit as the ink. This spiritual letter-writing involves the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The more we dispense Christ into others in this way, the more they will be constituted of Him.</p>
<p>The speaking in the Lord&rsquo;s ministry should always be a writing of Christ upon the saints. On the side of the one speaking, this writing is a dispensing. But on the side of those receiving the ministry, it is a matter of constituting.</p>
<p>I believe that those who have been constituted of Christ through the ministry cannot lose this constitution even if they leave the church life. Someone may leave the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, but he will still retain what has been constituted into him. He may not want to take the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery any longer, but he cannot deny the fact that, at least to some extent, he has been constituted of Christ.</p>
<p>If we minister to others according to what we have experienced of God, Christ, and salvation, our ministering to them will be the writing of Christ into them. This kind of writing is a dispensing. Eventually, this dispensing results in constituting. Those who are constituted of Christ in this way cannot be the same as they used to be, for something has been dispensed into them and has been constituted into their being. The result of this dispensing and constituting is that we become letters of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">COMPETENT MINISTERS<br />
CONSTITUTED OF THE LIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In 3:3 Paul says that the Corinthian believers were a letter of Christ ministered by the apostles, &ldquo;inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.&rdquo; In 3:6 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&rdquo; The Greek words rendered &ldquo;made us sufficient&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;enabled us,&rdquo; &ldquo;qualified us,&rdquo; &ldquo;made us competent.&rdquo; God made the apostles competent, sufficient, as ministers of the new covenant, not of letter but of the Spirit who gives life.</p>
<p>The Spirit in verse 6 is the Spirit of the living God, with whom the apostles minister Christ into the believers to make them His living letters. The apostolic ministry for the New Testament is not of dead letters like the Mosaic ministry for the Old Testament. Rather, the apostolic ministry for the New Testament is of the living Spirit, the Spirit who gives life.</p>
<p>The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, as a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the believers and apostles, making them ministers of a new covenant, the covenant of life. Hence, their ministry is one constituted of the Triune God of life by His life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>We should not think that only the apostles are sufficient as ministers of a new covenant. We all are ministering ones, and God has made us competent to minister.</p>
<p>God has made us competent ministers not of a covenant of letters, but of a covenant of the Spirit. Therefore, whatever we preach or teach should be a word constituted of the Spirit. For example, suppose a brother works in an office. His speaking to his colleagues about the Lord should not be a speaking apart from such a constitution of the Spirit. In his speaking he should give a testimony of what he has experienced of the Spirit, of how the Spirit has constituted him. Whenever we give this kind of testimony, we are ministering the new covenant, which is constituted of the Spirit. But if in our speaking we merely present doctrinal knowledge or theological teachings, what we are ministering may be compared to the Mosaic law, to a covenant without the Spirit.</p>
<p>We all need to have, and we all can have, a share in the New Testament ministry. Even the youngest among us may have such a ministry. In order to have this ministry, we need to have the experience of being constituted of the living Spirit. Then we shall be ministers not of letter, doctrine, or theology; instead, we shall be ministers of the living Spirit, writing Christ into others. This is a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A MINISTRY OF THE SPIRIT IN GLORY AND<br />
A MINISTRY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS<br />
ABOUNDING IN GLORY</h2>
<p>In 3:8 and 9 Paul says, &ldquo;How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory? For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.&rdquo; The ministry in verse 8 is the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life. The glory in this verse is the glory of God manifested in the face of Christ, which is God Himself shining forever in the hearts of the apostles (4:6), surpassing the glory of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant (v. 10).</p>
<p>In verse 9 Paul speaks of the ministry of condemnation. The ministry of the old covenant became one of death (v. 7), because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death (Rom. 5:13, 18, 20-21). Hence, it was also the ministry of condemnation.</p>
<p>In verse 9 Paul also speaks of the ministry of righteousness abounding in glory. The ministry of the new covenant is one of the Spirit who gives life, because the new covenant brings in God&rsquo;s righteousness unto life (Rom. 5:17, 21). Hence, it is also the ministry of righteousness. The apostolic ministry of the new covenant not only has glory, but it also abounds in the glory of God. This glory surpasses that of the Mosaic ministry of the old covenant (v. 10).</p>
<p>In 3:8 and 9 we see that God has constituted the ministry of the Spirit in glory and of righteousness abounding in glory. In order to understand this, we need to consider Paul&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>When Paul came forth to preach the gospel according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, his way of preaching was different from the way Moses received the decree of the law. Moses received the law, but he did not have any experience of what he received. According to the book of Exodus, God simply gave the tablets of the law to Moses. Paul&rsquo;s situation, however, was different. When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was zealous for the law and for Judaism, and he was absolutely opposed to Christ. But one day the Lord Jesus appeared to him, and from that time onward Paul experienced Christ. Eventually, he experienced Christ to such an extent that he was fully constituted of Christ. As a result, his life was constituted a life of the gospel. When he received the commission to minister in the Gentile world, he did not go forth like Moses, who brought the tablets to the people in an objective way. On the contrary, when Paul went out to preach the gospel, the gospel had been wrought into his being. Therefore, what he spoke to others concerning the gospel was a testimony.</p>
<p>Paul was not a law-giver; he was a witness of Christ, for he had been constituted of Christ. He was also a living expression of the gospel and of God&rsquo;s salvation. As one who was living Christ, his ministry was a ministry of glory, a ministry full of the Spirit.</p>
<p>In verse 9 Paul goes on to say that his ministry was the ministry of righteousness. This indicates that the ministry that is full of the Spirit eventually becomes a ministry of righteousness. If we would understand this, we need to see that if we are not full of life, we cannot be right. Righteousness is a matter of being right, and righteousness comes out of life. If we are full of the divine life, then we shall be right, and we shall have righteousness. Because the New Testament is a covenant of life, it makes people righteous. Therefore, the ministry of this covenant is a ministry not only of the Spirit but also of righteousness.</p>
<p>As a ministry of the Spirit, the ministry of the new covenant is in glory. But as a ministry of righteousness, it abounds in glory. To be in glory is the initial stage, but to abound in glory is to be in glory continually.</p>
<p>First, Paul&rsquo;s ministry was of the Spirit. As he carried out this ministry of the Spirit, it became the ministry of righteousness. Hence, his ministry was in glory and also was abounding in glory.</p><h2 class="head1">A GOOD DISPENSER</h2>
<p>The underlying thought in Paul&rsquo;s writing here is related to dispensing. In his ministry Paul was a good dispenser. He was dispensing the elements of the Triune God, of Christ, and of salvation and redemption. Because Paul was such a dispenser, his ministry was a ministry of the Spirit in glory and a ministry of righteousness abounding in glory. His ministry caused others to be alive, and it enabled them to be righteous. No one receiving Paul&rsquo;s ministry remained in a deadened condition, and no one continued to be unrighteous. Those under his ministry were enlivened and were made righteous, for his dispensing ministry was both a ministry of the Spirit and a ministry of righteousness.</p>
<p>Thus far, in chapter three of 2 Corinthians, we have covered three matters: the letter of Christ ministered by the apostles, inscribed with the Spirit of the living God (v. 3); God having made the apostles competent as ministers of a new covenant, ministers of the Spirit who gives life (3:6); and God having constituted the ministry of the Spirit in glory and of righteousness abounding in glory (3:8-9). All these matters are related to the constitution of life and ministry. Now in verses 17 and 18 we shall go on to consider the matter of transformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Concerning transformation, we need to see that the Lord is the Spirit. In verse 17 Paul says, &ldquo;And the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&rdquo; In chapter three of 2 Corinthians the Lord is the liberating Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, and the transforming Spirit. Life-giving, liberating, and transforming are all aspects of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. As the Spirit, the Lord is the divine Dispenser, and He is dispensing Himself into us.</p>
<p>In 3:17 Paul twice speaks of the Lord. According to the context of this section, which starts at 2:12, the Lord here must refer to Christ the Lord (2:12, 14, 15, 17; 3:3, 4, 14, 16; 4:5). This then, is a strong word in the Bible telling us emphatically that Christ is the Spirit. &ldquo;The Lord Christ of verse 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers (v. 6), and the ministration of which is with glory (v. 8). Compare Romans 8:9-11; John 14:16, 18&rdquo; (Vincent). Regarding the Lord being the Spirit, Alford says, &ldquo;The Lord of verse 16 is the Spirit,...which giveth life, verse six, meaning, &lsquo;the Lord&rsquo;, as here spoken of, &lsquo;Christ&rsquo;, &lsquo;is the Spirit&rsquo;, is identical with the Holy Spirit:...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ.&rdquo; Furthermore, Williston Walker says, &ldquo;All that transforming and indwelling Spirit is Christ Himself. &lsquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In verse 17 Paul first tells us that the Lord is the Spirit, and then he goes on to speak of the Spirit of the Lord. The Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself, with whom there is freedom. The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the Triune God, was &ldquo;not yet&rdquo; in John 7:39, because at that time Jesus was not yet glorified. He had not yet finished the process which He, as the embodiment of God, must pass through. After His resurrection, that is, after the completion of all the processes, including incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, which the Triune God had to pass through in man for His redemptive economy, He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This life-giving Spirit is called &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; in the New Testament (Rom. 8:16, 23, 26-27; Gal. 3:2, 5, 14; 6:8; Rev. 2:7; 3:22; 14:13; 22:17), the Spirit who gives us the divine life (2 Cor. 3:6; John 6:63) and frees us from the bondage of the law.</p>

<p>In 3:18 Paul continues, &ldquo;And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;and&rdquo; at the beginning of verse 18 indicates something further. First, the heart turns to the Lord so that the veil may be taken away (v. 16). Second, the Lord as the Spirit frees us from the bondage of the law (v. 17). Last, with unveiled face we, as a mirror, behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and are thus being transformed into His image from glory to glory.</p>
<p>According to verse 18, with an unveiled face we are beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord. Here &ldquo;unveiled face&rdquo; is in contrast to the veiled mind, the veiled heart, in verses 14 and 15. This means that our heart has turned to the Lord so that the veil has been taken away, and the Lord as the Spirit has freed us from the bondage, the veiling, of the law so that there is no longer any insulation between us and the Lord. Now we can behold Him and reflect Him. To behold is to see the Lord for ourselves; reflecting is for others to see Him through us.</p>
<p>Paul specifically says that we behold the glory of the Lord. This is the glory of the Lord as the resurrected and ascended One. As such a One, who is both God and man, He passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion, and entered into resurrection, accomplishing full redemption and becoming a life-giving Spirit. Now as the life-giving Spirit He dwells in us to make Himself and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained real to us so that we may be one with Him and be transformed into His image from glory to glory.</p><h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMED METABOLICALLY</h2>
<p>When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. In other words, He dispenses these elements into us. The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence. We are then transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. The words &ldquo;being transformed&rdquo; indicate that we are in the process of transformation. The &ldquo;same image&rdquo; here is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. We are being conformed to the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ (Rom. 8:29); we are being made the same as He is.</p>
<p>Paul tells us that we are being transformed into the same image &ldquo;from glory to glory.&rdquo; This means that we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree. This denotes an ongoing process of life in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In this verse Paul says that we are being transformed &ldquo;from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like Father God and Lord Christ. This expression again proves strongly and confirms the fact that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ. In this chapter this Spirit is revealed as the inscribing Spirit (v. 3), the life-giving Spirit (v. 6), the ministering Spirit (v. 8), the freeing Spirit (v. 17), and the transforming Spirit (v. 18). Such an all-inclusive Spirit is crucial to the ministers of Christ and to their ministry for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT<br />
INFUSING CHRIST INTO OTHERS</h2>
<p>After speaking about the ministry of the new covenant, Paul continues to speak about the ministers of the new covenant. From verse 12 to 18, he first depicts the new covenant ministers as persons whose hearts have turned to the Lord, whose faces are unveiled, who are enjoying the Lord as the Spirit freeing them from the bondage of the law, and who are being transformed into the image of the Lord by beholding and reflecting Him. Through such a process of transformation, they are constituted to be ministers of Christ by the Spirit with the elements of Christ&rsquo;s Person and work. Hence, their person is a constitution of Christ, and their ministry is to minister Christ to others, infusing them with the all-inclusive Christ as the indwelling, life-giving Spirit. All believers should imitate them to be the same kind of person and to accomplish the same kind of ministry.</p>
<p>In order to be transformed into the image of Christ, we need to behold and reflect His glory. As we behold Him, His element is transfused into us. This transfusion, this infusion, is altogether a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE MATURITY OF LIFE AND<br />
CONSTITUTION OF MINISTRY</h1>
<h1 class="title">(6)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 4:4, 6-7, 16; 5:17; 10:1; 11:10</h1>
<p>In this message we shall give a concluding word regarding the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issuing in the maturity of life and constitution of ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VEILED BY THE GOD OF THIS AGE</h2>
<p>In 4:4 Paul, referring to those who are perishing (v. 3), says, &ldquo;In whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine in them.&rdquo; Christ is the image of God, the effulgence of His glory (Heb. 1:3). Hence, the gospel of Christ is the gospel of His glory that illuminates and shines forth. Satan, the god of this age, has blinded the minds and the thoughts of unbelievers, so that the illumination of the gospel of Christ&rsquo;s glory should not shine in their hearts. This is similar to covering the lens of the camera so that light cannot shine into the camera with the image that is being photographed.</p>
<p>Literally, the Greek word translated &ldquo;shine&rdquo; means to see distinctly, to discern, and also to shine. Hence, the translation of the second part of verse 4 may read, &ldquo;So that they should not see the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.&rdquo; Because the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, they cannot see the illumination of the gospel&rsquo;s glory, just as a blind man, or a man with his eyes veiled, cannot see the light of the sun.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD SHINING IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>In 4:6 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts results in the illumination of knowing the glory of God in the face of Christ, that is, in the enlightenment that causes us to know the glory of the gospel of Christ. The illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ&rsquo;s gospel known to us issues from the shining of God in our hearts.</p>
<p>In understanding Paul&rsquo;s word in 4:6, we may regard &ldquo;illumination&rdquo; as equal to light and speak of the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ. According to this verse, the gospel is the gospel of the glory of Christ. This gospel has light, illumination. The light of the gospel of the glory of Christ shines in us. This is actually God shining Himself into our being. Do you know what this shining is? This shining is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>When the gospel is preached in a proper way, people should experience God&rsquo;s shining Himself into them. They should have the consciousness of light being transfused into them. This means that the proper gospel preaching involves God&rsquo;s shining into our heart. This shining in our heart is God&rsquo;s dispensing. As He shines into us, He dispenses the divine element into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRIT AND LIGHT</h2>
<p>In 3:3, 6, 17, and 18 we have the Spirit, and in 4:4 and 6 we have light. Whenever we preach the gospel or minister, we must be full of the Spirit and also full of light. If we speak without the Spirit and without light, nothing will be dispensed into others. But when our speaking is with the Spirit and with light, the Spirit and the light will accomplish the work of dispensing. Whenever the divine light is shining, this shining dispenses the divine element into others. As a result, they become constituted of this element. Therefore, our speaking must be full of the Spirit and light.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE ASPECTS OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>In chapter four we have the light; in chapter three, the Spirit; and in chapter two, the incense (vv. 14-15). These three&mdash;the incense, the Spirit, and the light&mdash;are all related to the divine dispensing. In 2:14-16a Paul says, &ldquo;But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place; for we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing: to the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.&rdquo; Because the apostles had been permeated with Christ, they became a fragrance of Christ. As they spread abroad the fragrance of the incense of Christ, this fragrance was dispensed into others. Likewise, as the Spirit works, He dispenses the divine element into people. Furthermore, as the divine light shines, this shining causes the Triune God to be dispensed into them. Therefore, the scattering of the incense, the working of the Spirit, and the shining of the light are all for the divine dispensing. This is Paul&rsquo;s underlying thought in these three chapters.</p>
<p>The more a person is exposed to the fragrance of incense, the more this fragrance will permeate him. For example, suppose a person stays for a period of time in a room filled with incense. The fragrance of that incense will be imparted to him. When he comes out of the room, he will carry with him the fragrance of the incense. This is an illustration of the fact that the scattering of the incense of Christ is actually a matter of the divine dispensing. Furthermore, the activity of the life-giving, transforming Spirit in chapter three and the shining of the light in chapter four is also related to the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THIS TREASURE IN EARTHEN VESSELS</h2>
<p>In 4:7 Paul says, &ldquo;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything. But we who contain this treasure are earthen vessels, worthless in ourselves and fragile. A priceless treasure is contained in such worthless vessels. This has made the worthless vessels ministers of the New Testament with a priceless ministry. This change is accomplished by the divine power in resurrection. The excellence of the power is surely of God and not of us.</p>
<p>This treasure, the indwelling Christ, in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply for the Christian life. It is by the excellent power of this treasure that the apostles as the ministers of the new covenant are capable of living a crucified life so that the resurrection life of Christ whom they minister may be manifested. Therefore, they manifest the truth for the shining of the gospel.</p>
<p>The result of the divine dispensing is that Christ becomes the treasure contained in us, the earthen vessels. The permeating of the incense, the working of the Spirit, and the shining of the light all produce Christ in us. In this way Christ is dispensed, transfused, into our being. Now this indwelling Christ is a treasure in earthen vessels. This treasure is constituted into us through the process of the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMING OF THE OUTWARD MAN<br />
AND THE RENEWING OF THE INWARD MAN</h2>
<p>We have pointed out that, as earthen vessels, we are containers of Christ as the treasure. But in actuality these containers become a prison for the Lord, and He is confined within us. Because Christ is imprisoned in us, the earthen vessel needs to be broken. Another way of expressing this is to say that the outward man needs to be consumed.</p>
<p>In 4:16 Paul says, &ldquo;Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day.&rdquo; The outward man has the body as its organ and the soul as its life and person. The inward man has the regenerated spirit as its life and person and the renewed soul as its organ. The life of the soul must be denied (Matt. 16:24-25), but the functions of the soul&mdash;the mind, will, and emotion&mdash;must be renewed and uplifted by being subdued (2 Cor. 10:4-5) in order to be used by the spirit as the person of the inward man.</p>
<p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;is decaying&rdquo; also means is being consumed, is being wasted away, is being worn out. By the continued killing, the working of death, our outward man, that is, our material body with its animating soul (1 Cor. 15:44), is being consumed.</p>
<p>Whereas the outward man is being consumed, the inward man is being renewed. It is renewed through being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life. As our outward man is being consumed by the killing work of death, our inward man, that is, our regenerated spirit with the inward parts of our being (Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; Rom. 7:22, 25), is being metabolically renewed day by day with the supply of resurrection life. Actually, the renewing of the inward man is also a matter of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>It is not an easy task for the Lord to consume our outward man. In order to accomplish this, He allows us to pass through many kinds of sufferings. Because we imprison Him, He must do the further work of breaking us and renewing us.</p>
<p>Sometimes we may be bothered by the fact that the more we love the Lord, the more we grow in Him, and the more spiritual we become, the more problems we have. For example, the more a certain young person prays, the more he may be persecuted by members of his family. The reason we suffer more as we grow more in the Lord is that we need to be broken, we need to experience the consuming of the outward man, so that Christ will no longer be imprisoned within us. Furthermore, we need the renewing of our inward man. This renewing is another stage of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>We may say that in chapter two with the incense we have an early stage of the divine dispensing. In chapter three we have a progressive stage of this dispensing. Then in chapter four, with the consuming of the outward man and the renewing of the inward man, we have a yet more advanced stage.</p><h2 class="head1">A NEW CREATION</h2>
<p>In 5:17 Paul speaks of the new creation: &ldquo;So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.&rdquo; To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and in nature. This is of God through our faith in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:26-28).</p>
<p>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does have the divine life and the divine nature (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4). Hence, the believers are a new creation (Gal. 6:15), not according to the old nature of the flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life.</p>
<p>When I was first saved, it was easy for me to declare that I was a new creation&mdash;all things had become new. But after being a Christian for many years, it seems that more and more things are still old. In order to become new, we need the breaking of the outward man and a renewing of the inward man.</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question: Are you the old man or the new man? It may have been that when you were first saved, you could say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! With me everything is new.&rdquo; But after being a Christian for many years, it may seem that you feel that you are old. For this reason, it is difficult for us to say whether we are the old man or the new man. Actually we are in the process of becoming a new creation by being broken and being renewed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENTREATING THROUGH THE MEEKNESS<br />
AND FORBEARANCE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 10:1 says, &ldquo;But I myself, Paul, entreat you through the meekness and forbearance of Christ.&rdquo; This indicates that Paul, being firmly attached to Christ (1:21) and one with Him, lived by Him and behaved in His virtues. Because Christ had been infused into Paul&rsquo;s being, Christ became his meekness and forbearance. Paul, therefore, was a person fully transfused and permeated with Christ. So Paul&rsquo;s meekness was Christ, and his forbearance was Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH OF CHRIST IN PAUL</h2>
<p>In 11:10 Paul says, &ldquo;The truth of Christ is in me.&rdquo; In this verse &ldquo;truth&rdquo; means truthfulness, as in Romans 9:1. Like meekness and forbearance in 2 Corinthians 10:1, this truthfulness is an attribute of Christ. Because Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ was became Paul&rsquo;s virtue in his behavior. Paul&rsquo;s truthfulness, his honesty, was the Christ who had been dispensed into him.</p>
<p>Because Paul had been transfused and permeated with Christ, in his ministry he could write living letters of Christ. He could dispense Christ through his ministry into others, for he had been infused with Christ to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Transfusion leads to constitution, and constitution produces transformation. This issues in the maturity of life and the constitution of ministry. This is accomplished by the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
THROUGH THE BELIEVERS&rsquo;<br />
ENJOYMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:3, 21-22; 4:15; 8:9; 12:9; 13:14; Rom. 5:5</h1>
<p>We need to see what is revealed in the Epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians. These Epistles reveal a wonderful divine matter: the Triune God dispensing His very essence into our tripartite being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CALLED BY GOD INTO THE FELLOWSHIP OF HIS SON</h2>
<p>In reading 1 and 2 Corinthians it is very easy for us to be attracted to, and even captured by, matters other than the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Therefore, in reading these Epistles, we need to pay attention to certain crucial points. For example, in 1 Corinthians 1:9 Paul says, &ldquo;God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; Here we see that we have been called by God into the fellowship of His Son. As we have seen, the fellowship of the Son of God is the partaking of, the participation in, the Son; that is, to partake of, to participate in, the all-inclusive Christ. God has called us into such a fellowship so that we may partake of Christ and enjoy Him as our God-given portion. God has called us into such an enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN CHRIST AS THE SPHERE AND ELEMENT</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 we see that Christ is the sphere and element into which we have been placed by God: &ldquo;Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; God has put us into a particular sphere, and this sphere is Christ. Hence, we need to realize that God has not only called us into the fellowship and enjoyment of Christ; He has also put us into Christ as our sphere and element.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAUL&rsquo;S VOCABULARY</h2>
<p>Sorry to say, many readers of the New Testament do not have any realization of the fact that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son and that He has also placed us in Christ. The reason they do not have any realization or impression regarding these matters is that they do not have such a concept, thought, or understanding as they read the New Testament.</p>
<p>Let us suppose, as an illustration, that you are reading a book that describes a particular machine and how it operates. If you do not have any knowledge of that machine, you may have little understanding of what you read concerning it. But someone with a thorough knowledge of that machine will easily understand what the book is saying. In fact, he only has to glance at what is written in order to grasp what is in the book. He may even understand more than what is actually written. Because he has a knowledge of the machine, he can easily take in what is written in the book about that machine.</p>
<p>In reading anything, we need to have an adequate knowledge of the vocabulary used. This is true even in the reading of a newspaper. The more adequate our knowledge of the vocabulary is, the more we shall understand what we read. This principle applies to our reading of the Bible.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:9 tells us that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son. God has called us into the enjoyment of a wonderful Person, the unsearchably rich Christ. However, if we do not have the knowledge of Paul&rsquo;s vocabulary, we shall not have much realization concerning what he is saying about the enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>Because certain matters in the Scriptures seem to fit in with our natural concepts, we respond immediately when we read them. For instance, in Ephesians 5:22 Paul says, &ldquo;Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord.&rdquo; A brother reading this verse may say, &ldquo;Yes, this word certainly applies to my wife. She should be in subjection to me.&rdquo; But if this brother were to read Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 1:30, a word that tells us that it is of God that we are in Christ, he may not have any understanding or response whatever. Such a word may sound very strange to him.</p>
<p>In the past, what was your reaction to Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 1:30 about being in Christ? Were you deeply impressed with this matter? Honestly speaking, when I read this verse as a young Christian, I was troubled by it. I did not know what it meant to be in Christ. Neither did I know how it was possible for us to be in Christ. When I asked others about this matter, they were not able to help me. I could not find anyone to help me understand this verse. If Paul had said here that it is of God that we are saved by Christ, I would have understood this verse immediately. However, I did not know what Paul meant by saying that it is of God that we are in Christ Jesus. I use this as an illustration of our need to have a proper knowledge of Paul&rsquo;s vocabulary.</p><h2 class="head1">WISDOM TO US FROM GOD</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul says not only that God has put us into Christ, but that Christ has become &ldquo;wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; We need to pay careful attention to Paul&rsquo;s expression. Paul does not say that Christ was given to us as wisdom. Instead, he says that Christ became wisdom to us from God.</p>
<p>Once again, we may use electricity as an illustration. Electricity is not merely given from the power plant. Actually, electricity is continually transmitted from the power plant to a building. The electricity flows from the power plant to the building. There is a continual transmission of electricity.</p>
<p>In a similar way, God does not merely give us Christ as our wisdom once for all. On the contrary, God has caused Christ to become wisdom to us. This means that, as electricity is transmitted from the power plant to a building, so Christ is continually transmitted into us from God to be our wisdom.</p>
<p>In order for a particular building to receive the transmission of electricity from the power plant, the building must maintain its connection to the power plant. If this connection is broken, the transmission of electricity will cease. Electricity is not given by the power plant to the building; it is continually transmitted from the power plant to the building. Therefore, there is the need for a continual attachment in order to have the continual flowing of the current of electricity. We need to see in this illustration that the electricity does not stay in the building. Rather, the electricity continually flows into the building.</p>
<p>In a similar way, Christ is not merely given to us as wisdom once for all. Rather, He is continually transmitted into us to be our wisdom. In order to receive this continual transmission of Christ as wisdom, we need to keep ourselves attached to Him.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, what we have in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is not the giving of Christ as wisdom. What we have here is the dispensing of Christ as wisdom into us. As the dispensing of electricity should be a continual matter, so the dispensing of Christ as wisdom should be also a continual matter. Now we can understand what Paul means when he says that Christ has become wisdom to us from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RIGHTEOUSNESS, SANCTIFICATION,<br />
AND REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:30 we see that Christ also becomes our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. We have seen that Christ was made wisdom to us from God as three vital matters in God&rsquo;s salvation: righteousness for our past, by which we have been justified by God that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life; sanctification for the present, by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life; and redemption for the future, that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), by which we shall be transfigured in our body with the divine life to have the Lord&rsquo;s glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21). It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation. In this salvation our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;becomes organically one with Christ, and Christ becomes everything to us. This is altogether of God, not of ourselves, that we may boast and glory in Him.</p>
<p>We should not regard the righteousness, sanctification, and redemption spoken of in 1 Corinthians 1:30 simply as objective matters. Actually, as our wisdom Christ is being transmitted into us to become our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. The very elements of righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are being transmitted into us in a subjective way.</p>
<p>A divine transmission is taking place from the heavenly power plant into our being. As the result of this transmission, Christ becomes to us a living and subjective righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Contrary to what we may have been taught in the past, there is no need for us to reckon Christ to be our righteousness. Righteousness here is not a matter of reckoning; it is a matter of transmission. Christ is being transmitted into us as our living righteousness and also as our living sanctification and redemption. This transmission is a matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>In chapter one of 1 Corinthians we have some crucial matters. We have the enjoyment of Christ, we have Christ as the sphere and element into which we have been placed by God, we have Christ becoming wisdom to us from God, and we have Christ being transmitted into us to be our living righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p><h2 class="head1">DISPENSING, GIFTS, AND FUNCTION</h2>
<p>In the book of 1 Corinthians we also see that through the divine transmission, through the divine dispensing, we have the gifts with which to function. In order to function in the church, we need the gifts. But where do the gifts come from? We should not think that spiritual gifts will suddenly come upon us in a miraculous way. On the contrary, all spiritual gifts are transmitted into us from God as the source.</p>
<p>God is the source of the gifts, and the transmitting agent of the gifts is the Spirit of God. Through the Spirit, by the Spirit, and with the Spirit God is transmitting Himself into our being. This transmission will go on until it reaches the point where we have a particular gift. Then we shall be able to function with this gift.</p>
<p>In chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians Paul lists the functions that come out of certain gifts, such as the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, prophecy, speaking in tongues, and the interpretation of tongues. We have pointed out that prophecy is a matter of speaking for Christ and even of speaking forth Christ. All these gifts are the outcome of the divine transmission. May we all see that this transmission is equal to what we call the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>In order to function, we need the gifts that come from the divine dispensing. When I was a young Christian, I did not have much experience of the divine transmission and therefore I felt that I could not function. For example, on a certain occasion I was called upon to offer a prayer at the end of the so-called service. I was greatly surprised when I heard my name, and I did not know what to say. At that time, I was not clear that the living Christ was in me and that the Spirit of the living God was transmitting the riches of Christ into my being. I had neither the knowledge nor the experience of this. For this reason, I did not feel that I could offer a prayer, much less speak in a public meeting. But after many years and by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have learned that, according to the Bible, we may function by the gifts that come from the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, function depends on at least three basic matters: first, the fact that we have been regenerated; second, on Christ living in us; and third, on the anointing of the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE &ldquo;OILING&rdquo; SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We are familiar with the fact that in the Bible anointing is related to oil. Therefore, to be anointed is to be &ldquo;oiled.&rdquo; We all have the &ldquo;oiling&rdquo; Spirit within us, anointing us day by day. What we need to do is stay firmly attached to Christ as the anointed One. In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, &ldquo;But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; God has firmly attached us to Christ, and now we need to stay attached to Him. If we stay attached to Him in our experience, the anointing, the oiling, will never cease.</p>
<p>Allow me to testify of my experience of the anointing as I was preparing to give this message. When I was with the Lord concerning the message, I was anointed by Him. I experienced a rich &ldquo;oiling&rdquo; of the Spirit. Because of this anointing, I was eager to come to the meeting for the purpose of dispensing the Triune God. I wanted to spread this ointment to others.</p>
<p>Our daily righteousness, sanctification, redemption and also our practical function in the church meetings come from the divine transmission. Because we experience such an inner transmission taking place day by day, we are anointed by the Spirit, &ldquo;oiled&rdquo; by Him. Through this anointing we have the divine essence within us for our experience and enjoyment. This is clearly revealed in the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</h1>

<p>In the foregoing message we pointed out that in the Epistles of 1 and 2 Corinthians we have the divine transmission, the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. In this message we shall consider further Paul&rsquo;s concept of this dispensing as expressed in 2 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A COMPARISON OF TWO MINISTRIES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Moses and Paul</h2>
<p>In the book of 2 Corinthians Paul&rsquo;s thought is very deep and rich. In this Epistle he presents a comparison of his ministry, the ministry of the new covenant, with that of Moses, the ministry of the old covenant. For example, in 3:7-9 Paul says, &ldquo;Now if the ministry of death, in letters engraved in stone, came in glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was being done away, how shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory? For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.&rdquo; In verse 7 we have the ministry of the old covenant, a covenant of dead letters that kill. In verse 8 we have the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life.</p>
<p>Moses was used by God to give the law. God called Moses to the mountain, prepared the two tablets of the law, and gave these tablets to him. Then Moses brought these tablets of the law to the children of Israel. This was the decree of the law, the giving of the law. In the words of John 1:17, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses.&rdquo; We may say that Moses was a mediator, a middleman, used by God to give His law to His people.</p>
<p>According to our understanding, the gospel was preached by or through the apostles, just as the law was given through Moses. Actually, this understanding is not accurate. It is, of course, correct to say that the law was given through Moses. But, strictly speaking, the gospel was not preached through Paul or the other apostles. You may find such a statement surprising, even shocking. However, this statement is based on what is revealed in the book of 2 Corinthians.</p>
<p>Especially the first four chapters of this Epistle indicate that Paul actually did not preach the gospel. Here Paul tells us first what God did. In 1:21 Paul says, &ldquo;He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&rdquo; Here we see that God attached the apostles with the believers to Christ, the anointed One.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, God has anointed Christ. All of the divine ointment is upon this One. Therefore, as the anointed One, Christ becomes the source of the divine anointing. Apart from Him, there is no anointing, for God has poured out His ointment entirely upon Christ.</p>
<p>In 1:21 we see that God has attached us, the apostles and believers, unto Christ as the source of the anointing. Paul indicates clearly that, as an apostle, he has been attached to Christ by God. Because we have been firmly attached to Christ, God has anointed us. Through our being attached to Christ, the anointing spontaneously comes from Christ to us. Now we also are anointed with the Spirit, or we may say that we are &ldquo;oiled&rdquo; with the Spirit.</p>
<p>In 1:22 Paul goes on to say that God &ldquo;has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.&rdquo; How marvelous is this sealing and pledging of the Spirit!</p>
<p>It was a simple matter for God to give the law. In giving the law, God only had to call Moses to the mountaintop, prepare the stone tablets, and give them to Moses. Moses then gave the law to the people. That was the Old Testament ministry.</p><h2 class="head2">Anointed and Saturated with Christ</h2>
<p>The New Testament ministry is very different from that of the Old Testament. We see this in the case of Saul of Tarsus, who was opposed to Christ. His intention was to damage the believers and churches. But while he was on the way to Damascus, he was &ldquo;caught&rdquo; by the Lord Jesus. At that time, God firmly attached Saul of Tarsus to Christ, the anointed One, the One full of anointing.</p>
<p>In a sense, we may compare this anointing to paint. As Paul became attached to Christ, the anointed One, the &ldquo;painted&rdquo; One, we may say that he also became &ldquo;painted&rdquo; with the divine ointment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Saul was sealed with the Spirit, and he experienced the pledge of the Spirit in his heart as a guarantee and foretaste. As a result, this man became Paul, and no longer was Saul; he was no longer the same as he had been. As Paul, he was one attached to Christ, anointed with Christ, and sealed with the Spirit.</p>
<p>As an illustration of what it means to be sealed with the Spirit, we may use the example of applying ink to a sheet of paper. As the ink is applied, it permeates and saturates the paper until the paper is soaked with ink. In a similar way, as one sealed with the Spirit, Paul was saturated with Christ. He was attached to Christ, he was anointed with Christ, and he was thoroughly sealed with Christ. Moreover, into his heart God put His Spirit as a pledge.</p>
<p>As a person anointed with Christ and saturated with Him, Paul could impart Christ to others. What does it mean to impart Christ to others? To impart Christ is to dispense Him. Many of those who came into contact with Paul received the divine dispensing through him. Christ was dispensed into them from God and yet through Paul. This is the proper preaching of the gospel, and this is altogether different from the Old Testament ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Outward Shining and Inward Shining</h2>
<p>While Moses was with the Lord on the mountain receiving the law, he also received some amount of the divine dispensing. The skin of Moses&rsquo; face was saturated by God&rsquo;s element. Therefore, when Moses came down from the mountain, the skin on his face was shining. But, as Paul points out in 2 Corinthians 3 and 4, with Moses the shining was only on his skin, but with us the shining is in our heart. Moses experienced an outward shining, but we experience an inward shining.</p>
<p>The glory of the ministry of the law was a temporary glory shining on Moses&rsquo; face. In this respect it was being done away, on account of the surpassing glory (3:10). Because of the glory of the new covenant ministry (which is the glory of God, even God Himself, manifested in the face of Christ forever, surpassing the temporary glory of the old covenant ministry shining on Moses&rsquo; face), the temporary glory of the ministry of the law disappeared and no longer existed.</p>
<p>In 3:13 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;And are not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel should not gaze unto the end of that which was being done away.&rdquo; While Moses spoke the word of God to the sons of Israel, he kept his glorified face unveiled. After speaking, he veiled his face (Exo. 34:29-33) lest they should see the end of his ministry, which was passing away. He did not want them to behold the termination of the fading glory of his ministry of the law.</p>
<p>In 4:6 Paul speaks of the shining in our hearts: &ldquo;Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.&rdquo; Here in &ldquo;our hearts&rdquo; is much deeper than on &ldquo;the skin&rdquo; of Moses&rsquo; face (3:7; Exo. 34:29-30). This presents a comparison between the glory of the apostolic ministry of the gospel and that of the Mosaic ministry of the law. In the heart is related to the inner life, whereas on the skin of the face has nothing to do with the inner life. The glory of the old covenant is on the surface, but the glory of the new covenant is full of depth.</p>
<p>The face of Christ in this verse is in contrast to the face of Moses. The glory of the gospel in the face of Christ is much superior to the glory of the law on the face of Moses. The former shines in the face of One through whom grace and reality came, issuing in righteousness and life (3:8-9); the latter shone on the face of one through whom the law was given, resulting in condemnation and death (3:7, 9). The shining of God in our hearts is to illumine us not that we may know the glory on Moses&rsquo; face, but that we may know the glory in Christ&rsquo;s face. The shining of God in our hearts is to enlighten us not that we may know the law of Moses of the old covenant, but that we may know the gospel of Christ of the new covenant.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s shining results in the illumination of knowing the glory of God in the face of Christ; that is, in the enlightenment that causes us to know the glory of the gospel of Christ. The illumination that makes the glory of Christ&rsquo;s gospel known to us issues from the shining of God in our heart.</p><h2 class="head2">Preaching Christ</h2>
<p>Actually, 4:6 is an explanation of verse 5, where Paul says, &ldquo;For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake.&rdquo; The apostles preached Christ as Lord and themselves as the believers&rsquo; slaves because the very God who commanded light to shine out of darkness had shined in their hearts. His shining in the universe produced the old creation. Now His shining in their hearts has made them a new creation. Therefore, they are able to exalt Christ as the Lord in their preaching and conduct themselves as slaves to the believers in their service. What they do for Christ and what they are to the believers are the issue of God&rsquo;s shining. God&rsquo;s shining produces the new covenant ministers and their ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S SHINING AND HIS DISPENSING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s shining into our hearts is His dispensing of Himself into us. As an illustration, we may use the example of an iron bar that glows after it has been placed in fire. We may say that the fire dispenses itself into the iron so that the iron becomes permeated by and with the fire. As the result of this dispensing and permeating, the iron bar shines.</p>
<p>The illumination in 4:6 may be compared to fire. I believe that Paul&rsquo;s thought here is that God&rsquo;s shining, His illuminating, was like a fire burning. As God shines in our heart, we are saturated with the divine essence. Just as we could say that fire &ldquo;saturates&rdquo; an iron bar, we are saturated with the essence of God through His illuminating, through His shining in our hearts.</p>
<p>I can testify of this from my own experience with the Lord. When I stay with the Lord in prayer, often I sense an inner burning, an inner illumination. Using today&rsquo;s term, I would call this an experience of the divine dispensing. The burning and illuminating I experience when I stay with the Lord is actually the illumination of the glory of God. This illumination is His dispensing.</p>
<p>Through such a dispensing, we are filled, saturated, and permeated with the Triune God. As a result, we have the intense desire to minister the word of God to others so that they also may experience the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">METAPHORS THAT DESCRIBE<br />
THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2>
<p>As we have pointed out, Paul uses other metaphors in chapters two and three to describe the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. In 3:3 he says, &ldquo;Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.&rdquo; A letter of Christ is one composed of Christ as the content to convey Christ and express Him. As Paul was writing a living letter of Christ, Christ was every letter, word, phrase, sentence, and paragraph. The &ldquo;ink&rdquo; used in this writing was the Spirit of the living God. While Paul was teaching the Word or preaching the gospel, he was inscribing Christ into others.</p>
<p>Today we all should be those who compose living letters of Christ by inscribing Christ into others. As we speak, we should inscribe Christ into others with the &ldquo;ink&rdquo; of the Spirit. As ink saturates paper, so we need to cause others to be saturated with the Spirit. This saturation is, once again, a matter of the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>In 2:14-16a Paul uses the metaphor of incense-bearers: &ldquo;But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place; for we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing: to the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.&rdquo; Because the apostles were permeated with Christ, they became a fragrance of Christ to God. We may say that they were permeated with Christ as the divine perfume. Wherever they went, God could manifest through them a sweet fragrance of Christ.</p>
<p>In chapter two we have the fragrance; in chapter three, the divine ink; and in chapter four, the light. We need to have the fragrance permeating us, the Spirit saturating us, and the light burning in us. This light dispenses God as a divine fire into our being. As the result of this dispensing, we become permeated and saturated with incense, the Spirit, and light. Then what issues out from us in our speaking becomes our ministry, a ministry of dispensing the Triune God. Whenever we speak in preaching the gospel or teaching the Word, we dispense the Triune God into others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE TRIUNE GOD IN HIS DISPENSING</h2>
<p>We need to be deeply impressed with what is revealed in the books of 1 and 2 Corinthians. In these Epistles we have a revelation of the Triune God. Here we have the Triune God as our enjoyment; the Triune God as our power; the Triune God as our wisdom; the Triune God as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; the Triune God as the gifts for our functioning; and the Triune God as the ointment to anoint us, as the fragrance to permeate us, as the Spirit to saturate us, and as the light to burn in us.</p>
<p>This experience of the Triune God in His dispensing is altogether different from religion. It is also different from mere doctrine and teaching and from efforts to improve ourselves or adjust ourselves. What is revealed in these books is the transfusing, the dispensing, the permeating, the saturating, of the Triune God in our being. This is the real enjoyment of the Triune God. As we shall see in the next message, the last word uttered by Paul in 2 Corinthians concerns this divine dispensing, the dispensing of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY<br />
THROUGH THE BELIEVERS&rsquo;<br />
ENJOYMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:3, 21-22; 4:15; 8:9; 12:9; 13:14; Rom. 5:5</h1>
<p>In this message we shall consider further the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity through the believers&rsquo; enjoyment of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENJOYMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Grace, Love, and Fellowship</h2>
<p>In 13:14 we see the enjoyment of the Triune God. In this verse Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment (John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10), the love of God is God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation.</p>
<p>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are not three separate matters, but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods, but three &ldquo;hypostases...of the one same undivided and indivisible&rdquo; God (Philip Schaff). The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God, for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit&mdash;with the divine virtues. In 13:14 the grace of the Lord is mentioned first because this book is on the grace of Christ (1:12; 4:15; 6:1; 8:1, 9; 9:8, 14; 12:9).</p>
<p>Such a divine attribute of three virtues&mdash;love, grace, and fellowship&mdash;and such a Triune God of the three divine hypostases&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are needed by the believers so that they may experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. This verse is a strong proof that the trinity of the Godhead is not for the doctrinal understanding of systematic theology, but for the dispensing of God Himself in His trinity into His chosen and redeemed people.</p>
<p>It is common in so-called Christian services for the minister to use 13:14 as a benediction at the close of a service. However, this verse speaks of our enjoyment of the Triune God. Do you enjoy the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit? In the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the grace of the Lord, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit are for our experience and enjoyment.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that just as the love of God is God Himself, the grace of Christ is Christ Himself. The New Testament says, &ldquo;God is love&rdquo; (1 John 4:8). We can also say that Christ is grace and that the Holy Spirit is fellowship. If we did not have God, we could not have the enjoyment of love. If we did not have Christ, we could not have the enjoyment of grace. If we did not have the Spirit, we could not have the enjoyment of fellowship.</p>
<p>We also need to be impressed with the fact that in 13:14 love, grace, and fellowship are not three separate matters. Rather, they are three aspects of one thing. Love is the source, grace is the expression of the source, and fellowship is the transmission of the expression. Love as the source is expressed in grace, and this grace is transmitted into us by fellowship. The love of God is the source of the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the transmission of the grace of Christ with the love of God. Therefore, love, grace and fellowship are all within us for our enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head2">A Simultaneous Enjoyment</h2>
<p>We enjoy love, grace, and fellowship all at the same time. We should not think that first we enjoy love, then we enjoy grace, and finally we enjoy fellowship. While we enjoy the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God. Just as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods but three aspects or persons of the one God, so love, grace, and fellowship are three aspects of one thing. The Triune God is the Father full of love, the Son full of grace, and the Spirit full of fellowship.</p>
<p>We should not think that we successively enjoy the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit. No, we enjoy the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit simultaneously.</p>
<p>Although we enjoy love, grace, and fellowship simultaneously, we may nevertheless point out that love is the source, grace is the course, and fellowship is the destination. Do you know what our destination is? It is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah, we enjoy the Triune God and His virtue in the three aspects of love, grace, and fellowship!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the Epistle of 2 Corinthians we see the abounding grace (4:15), the enriching grace (8:9), and the sufficient grace (12:9). In 4:15 Paul declares, &ldquo;For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, abounding through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.&rdquo; According to the context, grace is the very Christ who lives in the apostles as their life and life supply for them to live a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life, that they may carry out their ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant.</p>
<p>Concerning grace, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:10, &ldquo;But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.&rdquo; We may say that grace here is actually the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection. Hence, grace is the Triune God becoming life to us and everything to us. It was by this grace that Saul of Tarsus, the foremost of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15-16), became the foremost apostle, laboring more abundantly than all the other apostles.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 8:9 Paul speaks of the enriching grace: &ldquo;For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, being rich, for your sakes He became poor, in order that you by His poverty might become rich.&rdquo; It is grace to us that the Lord Jesus, being rich, became poor for our sakes. In the same principle, it will be grace to others if we are willing to sacrifice our material wealth for their sakes.</p>
<p>According to 12:9, the Lord spoke to Paul concerning His sufficient grace: &ldquo;And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.&rdquo; Paul was experiencing suffering and trial. Sufferings and trials are often in the Lord&rsquo;s ordination for us that we may experience Christ as grace and power. For this reason, the Lord would not remove the &ldquo;thorn&rdquo; from the apostle as he had entreated. Rather, the Lord assured him that His grace was sufficient for him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD POURED OUT IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>Concerning the divine love, Paul says in Romans 5:5, &ldquo;The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.&rdquo; From the day we believed in the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out in our hearts. This is not merely a matter of feeling. On the contrary, something substantial, something essential, has been poured out into our hearts. This means that, as believers, deep in our hearts we have something of the divine essence, and this is God as love. In other words, God as love is the divine essence that has been poured out into our hearts. Therefore, the pouring out of the love of God into our hearts is not merely a matter of feeling; rather, it is a matter of the essence of God.</p>
<p>Because something of the divine essence has been poured out into our hearts, the heart of every Christian is a heart of love. I can testify that from the time of my regeneration my heart has been very different from what it was before regeneration. Because we have been regenerated, we have the loving essence within us, even if we are temporarily angry about something. This loving essence is God Himself as love. The Father&rsquo;s nature, His essence, has been poured out into our hearts, and now we have this essence within us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1 we have the Holy Spirit as the anointing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, and as the pledge in our hearts (1:21-22). Concerning these aspects of the Spirit, Paul says, &ldquo;But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, who has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.&rdquo; Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are automatically anointed with Him by God. The anointing in 1:21 is the sealing in 1:22. Because God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him. Moreover, we have the Spirit as the pledge. The pledge of the Spirit is actually the Spirit Himself as the pledge. The sealing of the Spirit is a mark that we are God&rsquo;s inheritance, and the pledging of the Spirit is a guarantee, an earnest, of God being our portion in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STAYING WITH THE TRIUNE GOD THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>If we would enjoy the Triune God, we need to spend more time to pray. However, we should not pray in the sense of asking God for so many things; instead, we should pray in the sense of staying with God. We may say that God is a burning fire, and by prayer we should stay in Him as the fire and allow this fire to burn something of God Himself into our being.</p>
<p>If we stay with the Father through prayer, we shall experience not only the love of God but also the grace of Christ. We shall have the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s grace for our enjoyment, and this grace will be abounding, enriching, and sufficient to us in our experience. This grace, in particular, will make us competent or sufficient in ministering and in dispensing Christ to others. This sufficiency comes from the abounding and enriching grace within us.</p>
<p>As we stay with the Father of love, enjoying the abounding grace of the Lord, we shall also be in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Actually, we shall be merged with the flowing Spirit. We shall have the sense deep within that something is flowing in us, even that the Holy Spirit is flowing in us. This is the enjoyment of the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and this is also the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.</p>
<p>Day by day, we need to spend more time with the Father as the source. We need to pray in order to stay at the source. Today this source is in our spirit. If we stay in our spirit with God the Father for a period of time, we shall experience the divine dispensing. While we are remaining with the Father as the source, we should not pray in a way that will distract us from Him. If we find that our prayer is distracting us, we should not continue to pray in that way. The kind of prayer we need is the prayer that keeps us with the Father as the source.</p>
<p>Likewise, we should not be distracted even by reading the Word. If we find that the reading of the Word becomes a distraction that takes us away from the Lord Himself, we need to turn to our spirit again and say, &ldquo;Lord, I praise You. How good it is for me to be here with You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should not pray to the Lord in a religious way. Instead, we should talk to Him in an intimate way, in the way we speak to those who are close to us. I encourage you to go to the Lord and talk to Him as to an intimate friend. When the Lord was with His disciples, as recorded in the four Gospels, there is no indication that they prayed to Him in a religious way. The disciples prayed to Him as if they were speaking to a friend. They did not offer any religious prayer or religious worship. We need this kind of prayer, the prayer that keeps us in the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>Actually, instead of speaking of being in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, I would rather say that we should be in oneness with the Lord. We are not simply in the presence of the Lord&mdash;we are in oneness with Him. Speaking to the Lord in an intimate way keeps us in this oneness.</p>
<p>If we daily practice speaking to the Lord in this way, the fragrance of the divine incense will permeate us, the ointment will anoint and seal us, the &ldquo;ink&rdquo; of the Spirit will saturate us, and the divine light will illuminate us. As a result, we shall be thoroughly permeated with the Triune God. Then we shall enjoy the Father&rsquo;s love, the Son&rsquo;s grace, and the Spirit&rsquo;s fellowship. This is what we need today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING LIVING WITNESSES</h2>
<p>It is crucial for us to realize that the ultimate Person of the Godhead is the Spirit. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. In and through resurrection, Christ has become the life-giving Spirit. As the Spirit, the Triune God is awaiting the opportunity to anoint us, permeate us, and illuminate us so that we may be thoroughly saturated with Himself. The more we are saturated with the Lord, the more we shall become His living witnesses. In Acts 1:8 the Lord Jesus told the disciples that they would be witnesses to Him. They would be living witnesses of the living Jesus, witnesses saturated by Christ and with Him.</p>
<p>Through the divine dispensing we enjoy the Triune God. We enjoy the Father&rsquo;s love, the Son&rsquo;s grace, and the Spirit&rsquo;s fellowship. Through this enjoyment in the divine dispensing, we become one with the Triune God. Then we can dispense Him to others. Whenever we preach the gospel or teach the Word, we dispense Him. Whenever we fellowship with the saints, we dispense Him. This is the divine dispensing among the saints in today&rsquo;s church life. May we all experience more of the Triune God in His dispensing.</p></body></html>
