   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FORBEARANCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The life of the Lord Jesus is the best illustration of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consider how He spoke to those two disciples on the way to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Luke 24:15 says that while these disciples communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus said to them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? v. 17 . With a rebuking tone, one of the disciples answered, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? v. 18 . Appearing not to know anything, the Lord asked, What things? v. 19 . Then they proceeded to tell Him about Jesus of Nazareth, One they described as a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They went on to say that the chief priests and the rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death and crucified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How forbearing the Lord was to listen to the disciples speak things which He knew much better than they did!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After walking quite a distance, they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further v. 28 . However, they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And he went in to tarry with them. v. 29 . The Lord even sat down to dine with them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, their eyes were opened, and they knew him v. 31 . In all this we see the Lord s forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Besides the Lord Jesus, no human being has ever practiced a life of such forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you study the biographies of famous people, you will see that not one was truly a person of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if you read the four Gospels, you will see that the human living of the Lord Jesus was full of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus exercised forbearance with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Can you find a case where the Lord Jesus fired one of them?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord was forbearing even with Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CHRIST AS OUR FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need forbearance in the church life, especially in our serving together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose a particular sister is serving in a way that is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sister serving with her faces at least four options: walk away, join her in serving in her poor way, correct her, or try to improve her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>None of these options involves forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the one sister exercises forbearance, she certainly will not walk away from the other sister.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At least for a while, she will join the sister in her serving.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then she will exercise wisdom to see the sister s situation and to determine whether or not she can speak a word of correction or improvement in love.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the sister is not able to receive such a word, the other one needs to wait before saying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, she may have an opportunity to speak not according to her own intention, but according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is to exercise forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we all exercise forbearance, the church will be built up in a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The virtue of forbearance is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It includes love, kindness, mercy, reasonableness, the ability to fit in, and many other virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps now we can understand why Paul speaks of forbearance toward the end of a profound book on the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Paul exhorts us to let our forbearance be made known to all men, he is saying something of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No human being is able by the natural life to fulfill such a requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Confucius may have been very good, but he was still sinful and fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only the Lord Jesus lived a life full of forbearance, and only Christ can be our perfect forbearance today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The best word to sum up the totality of Christ s human virtues is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To make known our forbearance is to live a life which expresses Christ; it is to express the Christ by whom we live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a life is Christ Himself as the totality of all human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is Christ as our forbearance.</S>
