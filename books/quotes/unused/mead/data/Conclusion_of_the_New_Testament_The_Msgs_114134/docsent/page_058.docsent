   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>c In the Name Person of the Lord Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 6:11 reveals that we are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is not justification by Christ s blood in an objective way but subjective justification in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ in the organic union with Him through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are justified subjectively and dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>d In the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, according to 1 Corinthians 6:11 we are justified subjectively in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our being justified in the Spirit involves the dispensing of the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit dispenses His essence into us and thereby justifies us, makes us acceptable to God, dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>g. Reconciled to God in the First Step</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Originally, we were not only sinners but also enemies of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Enmity is the greatest problem between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were reconciled to God when we believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By faith we have received God s justification and reconciliation by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As believers we have been redeemed by being reconciled to God in the first step.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second Corinthians 5:19 and 20 show that reconciliation has two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 19 it is the world that is reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 20 it is the believers, who have already been reconciled to God, who are to be reconciled further to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This clearly indicates that there are two steps for us to be fully reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the first step we, as sinners, are reconciled to God from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this purpose Christ died for our sins 1 Cor 15:3 that they might be forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the objective aspect of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross to be judged by God upon Him for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The second step is that, as believers living in the natural life, we need to be reconciled to God from the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For this purpose Christ died for us the persons that we may live to Him in the resurrection life 2 Cor 5:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the subjective aspect of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this aspect He was made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 to be judged and done away with by God so that we may become the righteousness of God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By these two aspects of His death the Lord Jesus has fully reconciled God s chosen people to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first veil is called the screen Exo 26:37, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>. A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing the screen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This typifies the first step of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second veil Exo 26:31-35; Heb 9:3 still separated him from God, who is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This veil needed to be rent that he might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the second step of reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many believers have been reconciled to God in the first step, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But because they still live in the flesh, they need to pass the second veil, which has been rent already Matt 27:51; Heb 10:20 , to enter in through the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is reconciliation in the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of the need for believers to have the second step of reconciliation, Paul, in 2 Corinthians 5:20, says, Be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first step of reconciliation was accomplished when we believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the time we were forgiven, freed, washed, sanctified, and justified, God reconciled us to Him in position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, in disposition we are still against God in many ways and in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, we need further reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this message we shall be concerned only with being reconciled to God in the first step, leaving the second step for a later message.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1 As the Enemies of God,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That Is, Sinners in the World</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the enemies of God, that is, as sinners in the world, we have been reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 5:10a says, While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Second Corinthians 5:19a says that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once we were enemies of God, but we have been reconciled to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2 In Christ, That Is, through Christ</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have been reconciled to God in Christ, that is, through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to 2 Corinthians 5:19a, God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Colossians 1:20a, speaking of Christ, says, Through Him to reconcile all things to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Through Him means through Christ as the active instrument through which the reconciliation was processed.</S>
