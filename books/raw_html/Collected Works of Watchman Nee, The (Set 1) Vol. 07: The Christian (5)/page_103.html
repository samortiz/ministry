<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</H2><P>I am very sorry that due to the hurried publication of the second issue, many of the pages toward the end were not adequately proofread by me, so there were many errors. I would ask the readers to forgive us for this! In this issue we include an errata table. We hope that the readers will make the corrections according to the table and will thus not have any misunderstanding. </P><P>Except the articles that were written by the editor himself, all other articles are marked clearly with their source. Articles that are translated are marked "translated," and those that are quoted from other sources are marked "quotes." This will avoid any confusion. Some have wanted to know where the articles are from, and this will serve to explain their source. However, one thing should be clear: no matter from which window God's light comes into a dark room, the windows do not have to vie for glory or to boast. As long as light comes into the room, we are satisfied.</P><P>The Lord willing, the first article of every issue will concern the salvation of God. We hope that in the hand of unsaved ones, this paper will become a vessel to lead them to God. Those who are already saved would probably not be tired of reading about the salvation of the cross, for our eternal subject and memory in heaven will be the vicarious death of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>In this issue, we have an article by Mr. Henry concerning the church. Please pay attention to this article. At present, most papers that try to match the current of the age promote indigenous churches. They have all kinds of propositions. We are not here to insist on any opinions, but to learn to find out where God's will is and what His Word says. Other than God's Word (the Bible), we know of nothing else. Every one of us knows the unscripturalness of the distinction of sects. Furthermore, we are tired of the disputes that have come along with sectarianism. The only thing that we need to submit to is the teaching of the Bible. Besides this, we do not need to care for anything else. In the future, if there is anything that this paper will say about the church, it will be based on "Thus saith the Lord," not on anything else. If the readers can tolerate other papers' propositions of overthrowing the denominations and replacing them with indigenous churches, I hope that they can also tolerate this paper's propositions of a scriptural church. But then, what is the use of vain words? We know the truth in order to practice the truth. Hence, we hope that God's children would obey the Lord in the matter of the church. However, if unfortunately our minds are not the same, we hope this will not become a barrier between us.</P><P>The article on Genesis in this issue is very crucial. We hope that the readers will read it carefully with their Bibles open before them. In that article we explained the origin of Satan and the things of the first world. I should make a point of clarification here: The exposition of Ezekiel 28 in that article is done through much help from the famous English writer of the last generation, Mr. Pember.</P><P>All the subscribers' copies of this issue are sent out now. If you have not received yours, it is probably due to the unstable political condition of the times. Please write to us if you have not received yours, and we will send another copy to make up.</P><P>Friends, please do not forget to introduce our paper to others. It is not an easy thing to start a magazine. The reason we have done our best to publish it is that we want the truth to spread and to save and edify some people. We hope that you will have a share in this work and would do your best to introduce this paper to others. At present, we are not lacking in seekers for the truth. But they do not know about us and therefore have not subscribed to our magazine. I hope that you would at least introduce this paper to one other person this month, thus expanding the sphere of service of this paper to the saints. Thank you!</P><P>Watchman, Pagoda<br>December 12, 1925</P>
