<h1 class=msg>12</h1><h1 class=title>KNOWING GRACE FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD’S PURPOSE THE UNVEILING OF THE DIVINE TITLE AND THE CHANGING OF HUMAN NAMES FOR THE FULFILLING OF GOD’S PURPOSE</h1><h1 class=scripture>The Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God.… Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham.</h1><h1 class=scripture>Genesis 17:1, 5</h1><p>If we are to understand Genesis 17, we must know what God’s purpose is. God’s purpose, which He made in eternity past, is to express Himself through a body of people on earth. In order to have a collective people as His expression, God created the universe and within the universe, as its center, He created man in His image with the intention that man would express Him and represent Him so that He may have a dominion on earth as His kingdom. This was God’s purpose with Adam and with the children of Israel in the past, it is His purpose with the church today, and it shall be His purpose in the millennium and throughout eternity. Throughout all the ages, God’s purpose has remained the same: to have Himself expressed and represented by man on earth.<p>For the fulfillment of His purpose, God needs a people. If God can gain a people, He will be able to accomplish His purpose, but if He cannot gain a people, He will be defeated. But our God cannot be defeated! God created Adam, and Adam became a failure. Then God called Abraham to be the head of a new race. Although God called only one person, Abraham, this person had to become a race so that God could be expressed and represented on earth. God called Abraham for this purpose. It is impossible for an individual to fulfill God’s purpose, for what God needs is not just an individual but a people. One Abraham must be multiplied into a great many Abrahams. But this cannot be accomplished according to man’s natural understanding or by his natural ability, strength, or being.<h2 class=head1>GOD’S DESIRE TO WORK HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2><p>The Bible reveals that God’s way to express Himself is to work Himself into man. God’s way is extraordinary. Although God wants us to do things for Him, His desire is not that we do anything but that He come into us to do everything through us for Himself. His desire is to work Himself into us, making Him one with us and us one with Him. But no one is willing for God to do this. Everyone seems to say, “O Lord, if You ask me to do something, I’ll do it for You, but I cannot bear to have You come into me to annul me and dethrone me. When I do something for You, I like to do it by myself.” Nevertheless, God would say, “Before you do anything for Me, I must work Myself into you. By coming into you, I will have you crucified and then I will make you alive by, with, and for Me. Are you willing for this?” Abraham did not wait for God to do this, but, as Genesis 16 reveals, he acted on his own to bring forth a seed.<h2 class=head1>THE UNVEILING OF THE DIVINE TITLE</h2><p>In 17:1 God came in to unveil His divine title, unveiling what He, the very God, is. To unveil a name is to unveil a person, for a name always represents a person. Since God’s divine title denotes His divine Person, the unveiling of the divine title is actually the revelation of the divine Person. In 1:1 God was unveiled as Elohim, which primarily means the Mighty One, the Strong One, and which is mainly related to God’s creation. In Genesis 2 God was revealed as Jehovah, the great I Am. The name Jehovah means “I Am that I Am,” implying that God is the self-existent and ever-existing One. This title of Jehovah refers to God’s relationship with man. Furthermore, God revealed to Abraham that He was the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth (14:22). This is mainly related to God’s care for His people’s existence. But now in chapter seventeen, God comes in to unveil Himself further, revealing Himself to Abraham as El-Shaddai, the all-sufficient Mighty One with an udder.<p>God’s all-sufficiency is in His divine udder. Perhaps some readers are unhappy with the use of the word udder and prefer that we use the word breast. However, if we were to use the word breast, most people would associate it with the matter of love. But the divine title in 17:1 denotes that God is the rich source of supply as grace to His people for them to fulfill His purpose. Although He wants us to fulfill His purpose, He does not need anything from us. He wants to be our supply. Our God has an all-sufficient source of supply, and this source is likened to an udder. This is the meaning implied in the title El-Shaddai. Everything that is supplied to us from the udder of a cow comes into us and even becomes our constituent. All of the elements and ingredients of the riches of the milk we drink become our constituent, our organic tissue. It seemed that God was saying to Abraham, “You have known Me as the Most High God. Although that is wonderful, it is no longer adequate. I am not only the Most High God to you objectively, but I want to be the divine milk to you subjectively. I must be the One that you drink into your being.”
