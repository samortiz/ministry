   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Acceptance of Brother Nee's Ministry on Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but the Rejection of His Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>on the Practicality of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many in Christianity accept Brother Nee's ministry on Christ, but they reject his ministry on the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have shared previously how Brother Nee went to visit the Plymouth Brethren in England in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before that time he had read many of the Brethren's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Also, through Miss M.E. Barber, he became acquainted with the writings of Jessie Penn-Lewis and T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When he went to visit the Brethren in 1933, he also went to visit Brother Austin-Sparks at Honor Oak in London.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Brethren were bothered about this because they were exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They thought that Brother Nee had joined them and that he should not contact Brother Austin-Sparks' group.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During that time the Brethren took him to Canada and the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When he returned, he personally told me all the things concerning his trip.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our consideration we realized that we could neither follow the way of the Brethren nor follow the way of Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way of the Brethren was exclusive, and the way of Brother Austin-Sparks was without practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Brethren wrote us several letters, and we replied to them in 1935.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later Brother Nee went to Europe again in 1938, and he stayed there for one and a half years to have more fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mostly he was with Brother Austin-Sparks' group at Honor Oak.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was also invited to speak in some of the Scandinavian countries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In those one and a half years, he ministered mainly on the aspect of Christ as life because he realized that the people there were not ready to accept the aspect of the church in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Normal Christian Life is a collection of the messages Brother Nee gave then.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These messages were collected and edited by Angus Kinnear, who was a medical student under Brother Nee's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While Brother Nee was there, he also translated The Normal Christian Church Life from Chinese to English.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did that, of course, with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This book was translated in London while he was staying at Honor Oak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Miss Fishbacher helped him in this translation work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That book was printed by the bookroom of Brother Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After it was published, it stirred up some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Austin-Sparks told me many years later that The Normal Christian Church Life should either not be published anymore or that some corrections and changes should be made in it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, The Normal Christian Church Life is about the practicality of the church and the truth concerning one church in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the end of Brother Nee's one-and-a-half-year stay in England, the people at Honor Oak had a farewell meeting for him and asked him to give a word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He gave a short word saying that people's talking about the church is like carpenters' talking about making a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is one thing to talk about making a chair, but where is the chair?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then he said, "Many people are talking about the church, but I would ask, 'Where is the church?'"</S>
