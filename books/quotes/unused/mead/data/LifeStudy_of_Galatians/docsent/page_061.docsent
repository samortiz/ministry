   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 4:6 Paul declares, And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s Son is the embodiment of the divine life 1 John 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, the Spirit of God s Son is the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God gives us His Spirit of life, not because we are law-keepers, but because we are His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As law-keepers, we have no right to enjoy God s Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the sons of God, we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a Spirit, the Spirit of the Son of God, is the focus of the blessing of God s promise to Abraham 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verses 4 through 6 the Triune God is producing many sons for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law that we might receive sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He also sent forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Basically sonship is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The position and the right depend on the life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order for us to enjoy God s sonship, we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apart from the Spirit, we cannot be born of God to have the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once we have been born of the Spirit, we need the Spirit in order to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without the Spirit, we cannot have the position, right, or privilege of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the crucial points regarding sonship depend on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By the Spirit, we have the divine birth and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through the Spirit we grow unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because of the Spirit we have the position, right, and privilege of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, without the Spirit sonship is vain, an empty term.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when the Spirit comes, the sonship is made real.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We fully realize God s sonship in life, maturity, position, and right.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit of sonship cannot be replaced by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the contrary, everything, the law in particular, must be replaced by the Spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul s concept is that the law was a custodian, a warden.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although the law could keep us in ward, it could not give us the life, maturity, position, and right of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The law cannot bestow a position upon a child.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It can only serve as a child conductor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit, in contrast, gives life, maturity, position, and right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the law should not replace the Spirit; the Spirit must replace the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the law could not produce the reality of sonship, you may be wondering why the Spirit was not sent forth earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why did the Spirit not come before the law?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The answer is that the promise given to Abraham needed a period of time in order to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although God is not slow, He waited two thousand years before sending His Son to fulfill the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, God did not act quickly even in giving the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not come in immediately after Adam s fall to give to Adam the promise He eventually gave to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yes, the promise was given in Genesis 3 that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, God waited until man s cursed and fallen situation had been fully exposed at Babel before He intervened, called out Abraham, and made a promise to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At Babel, mankind became confounded, confused, and divided, fully exposed as being under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With such a background, no doubt Abraham deeply appreciated God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Abraham appreciated this promise more than Adam would have appreciated it, had the promise been given to him immediately after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, the reason for the delay is found on man s side, not on God s side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The principle is the same with respect to the fulfillment of the promise in the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose Christ had come immediately after the promise was given to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If such had been the case, the fulfillment of the promise would not have been nearly as meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consider all that happened between the time of Abraham and the birth of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the course of this period of two thousand years, God s chosen people were fully exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, the law exposed their corruption and helplessness; on the other hand, the law kept them until the coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The law fulfilled a necessary and useful function in keeping the children of Israel for God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The law preserved God s chosen people even while it was exposing them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE FULLNESS OF THE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 4:4 we see that God sent forth His Son when the fullness of the time had come.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ came at exactly the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Earlier would have been too soon, and later would have been too late.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Christ came when the time was right.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is illustrated by the picking of ripened fruit from a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the fruit is picked too soon, it will be unripe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if it is picked too late, it will be overripe.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ came at the appointed time, at the fullness of time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For this reason, His coming was full of meaning.</S>
