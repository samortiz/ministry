   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING GOD'S DISPENSING IN A FINER WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Incarnation, death, resurrection, and regeneration are all clearly unveiled in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, this Gospel goes on to show us that Christ gives us Himself as the living water John 4:10, 14 , that He is the bread of life, good for eating 6:35 , and that He has breathed Himself into us as the Holy Breath 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the time of our regeneration we need to always eat, drink, and breathe the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To eat, drink, and breathe the Lord are finer steps in His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Trees need their roots, but without the root hairs, a tree will not be able to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The root hairs are the finer means for the tree to absorb all the riches from the soil for its growth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regeneration has planted Christ as the "root" in our spirit, but we also need the "root hairs" of eating, drinking, and breathing the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are the finer means for God's dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God was incarnated for me, He died for me, He resurrected for me, and I have been regenerated!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we may still be superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Day by day we may not be breathing, drinking, and eating the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hymn #255 in Hymns speaks of our need to breathe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may sing this hymn, but do we breathe in the Lord day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Breathing in the Lord will make us another kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many Christians today are spiritually dead because they do not have the root hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All Christians know that God was incarnated and that Jesus died for us and our sins and was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, many do not know what it is to eat and drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many of us in the Lord's recovery do know how to eat, drink, and breathe the Lord, but we may not be practicing this in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may not know the practicality of the Spirit spreading Himself with our spirit into our soul and saturating our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have the teachings of these matters, but we may not have the reality in our tripartite being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>KNOWING THE WORD AS THE BASIS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>FOR OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our experience of eating, drinking, and breathing the Lord should be built upon the foundation of the deposit of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why Paul said, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly" Col 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need a good deposit of the word of Christ dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2 Timothy 1:14 Paul told Timothy, "Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among the many who followed the apostles, Timothy was one of the most faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was because he had a good deposit of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not think that we know so much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Several thousand messages of this ministry have been published, but we are still discovering new light from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all need to know more of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this purpose we must redeem our time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To redeem means to recover by paying something.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to purchase back the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not let our time be consumed so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every day we should gain something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must eat well and rest well, and we should have the proper bodily exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After this, however, we should redeem our time from all meaningless waste.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Telephone calls can be a meaningless waste of time for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, we may need to read the newspaper for a certain time every day to know the world situation, but lingering in the many pages of the paper is also a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should save our time for breathing, drinking, and eating the Lord and getting the Word into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Any book or page of the written ministry among us will help us to gain something of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On every page there is light, life supply, and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To eat the Lord is to spend more time in the Word in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no other way to eat the Lord but through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 6 stresses that the Lord is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the end of this chapter Peter says, "Lord, to whom shall we go?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You have words of eternal life" v. 68 . If we are going to enjoy the Lord as our food, we must enjoy the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life" v. 63 . The words of the Lord are the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Both the Spirit and the Lord Christ are embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the Word is the living Word, the Word of life.</S>
