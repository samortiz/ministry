   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE TRUTH OF THE MYSTERY IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 16:12-15 says, "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These four short verses reveal a very mysterious matter the mystery of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE ERROR OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The emphasis of traditional Christianity in expounding these few verses is that the Holy Spirit comes to teach us the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because many of the teachings that Jesus gave His disciples when He was on earth were too profound for them to understand, they had to wait for the Holy Spirit to come and teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Most Christian teachers say that in verse 12 many things refers to many doctrines, cannot bear them means that they could not receive or understand the doctrines, and that because of this the Lord would not teach them anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In traditional Christianity, the Spirit of reality in verse 13 is rendered as the Spirit of truth, and most people interpret truth to mean doctrine instead of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the understanding of these few verses in traditional Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In actuality, what the Lord said in John 16:12-15 is not a matter of understanding doctrines but a matter of entering into reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was not concerned about the disciples' being able to understand doctrines or truths, but about their being guided into all the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The traditional Bible expositors think that this passage is talking about doctrines; actually, this kind of understanding is wrong and misses the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason, they cannot enter into the mystery revealed in this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The mystery of this portion is in verse 15: "All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord did not say, "All that the Father knows has been made known to Me," because it is not a matter of doctrines; instead, He said, "All that the Father has is Mine," indicating that it is a matter of possessions and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Heir, He has inherited all that the Father has; all that the Father possesses has become His.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, all that the Father has is now His.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, this is not a matter of doctrine but a matter of "all that the Father has."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second half of verse 15 says, "For this reason I have said that He receives of Mine."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the Spirit of reality in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The phrase for this reason is an explanation, indicating that the Spirit of reality would not receive doctrines from the Lord, but rather, all the riches of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Declare it to you does not only mean that the Spirit would let the disciples know and understand all that the Father has, but also that the Spirit would transfer, transmit, even transfuse into them all that the Father has.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All that the Father possesses has been given to the Son and inherited by the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, now the Spirit of reality receives all these riches from the Son and then transfers, transmits, and even transfuses them into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT IN JOHN 16:15</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 16:15 is very mysterious. in this verse we have the Father "Mine," the Son "I," and the Spirit "He."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Like Matthew 28:19, this verse speaks of the mystery of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, while Matthew 28:19 is an obvious verse concerning the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, John 16:15 is a relatively hidden verse and is therefore seldom discussed by expositors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, John 16:15 and Matthew 28:19 are equally important.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This verse also refers to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the grace of Christ is mentioned first because it is the subject of 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Related to the revelation of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit this verse is also as important as the previous two verses.</S>
