   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONTRAST BETWEEN SAMUEL AND SAMSON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Bible students have pointed out that Samuel was a person of high character.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The matter of character, however, is not the crucial point regarding Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people have a high character, but they are just for themselves, their enterprise, and their kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are not for God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Samuel was not only high in character; he was high in the Nazarite vow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is worthwhile to compare Samuel with another Nazarite Samson.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Samson also was a Nazarite by his mother's vow, but he was very different from Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Bible speaks of Samson and the other judges, it often says that the Spirit of God rushed upon them Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>14:6, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But there is no such word about Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Nazarite does not need rushing power; rather, a Nazarite needs a heart that is a reflection of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Unlike Samson, Samuel did not gain a mighty victory by slaughtering a great number of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the contrary, Samuel was a Nazarite for God's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although it was not easy for Samuel to stand for God in his particular environment, he cared for God's interest and he turned the age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the Old Testament, Samuel is ranked with Moses in being for God and for God's interest Jer 15:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GOD USING A NEGATIVE KING TO DISCIPLINE ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The history in 1 Samuel was directed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God did not go directly to David because David was still young and because Israel, whom God loved to the uttermost, needed some training.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They needed to be disciplined by God with a negative king so that they would realize that replacing God with a king was not a matter of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is a God of patience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though Eli was not so positive, God allowed him to be the judge for forty years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is difficult to determine the length of Samuel's judgeship, which must have lasted at least thirty years before Saul came in to reign over Israel negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Next, God tolerated the reign of Saul for forty years, and then He brought in David.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GOD'S INTENTION THAT CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>WOULD BE BORN IN THE LINEAGE OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without Samuel it would have been very hard for God to carry out His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God had the intention that Christ would be born in the lineage of David, and only Samuel could bring in David.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without a David there would not have been the lineage of Christ's genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order for God to reach the time of incarnation, there had to be some preparation, and Samuel was a part of that preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God raised up Samuel and prepared him for God's use to do whatever was necessary to gain, through David, the proper lineage of the genealogy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE KINGDOM OF GOD BEGINNING WITH DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God used Samuel to anoint first Saul and then David.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As we will see when we consider the history concerning Saul, Saul only had a monarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The kingdom of God came first under David, when God's throne was established in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Matthew 21:43 the Lord Jesus told the Jewish leaders that the kingdom of God would be taken from them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that the kingdom of God began in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It did not begin with Abraham or with Moses but with David.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, what we see with David is not any kind of monarchy but the kingdom of God.</S>
