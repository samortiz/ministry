   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD JESUS' JUDGMENT AND PAUL'S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 26 tells us that the Lord suffered two kinds of judgment after His arrest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first was a religious judgment before the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The other was a political judgment before Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When asked by Pilate, the Lord Jesus did not answer anything because He was not under any earthly government.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When asked by the high priest, He was initially silent, but when the high priest challenged Him by the name of the living God, saying, "I charge You to swear by the living God to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God," He answered, "You have said rightly."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The religious court condemned Him based on this word vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>62-64 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why did the Lord decide to answer after His initial silence?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was because authority was involved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord had to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was not a matter of whether or not He needed to answer the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was a matter of what the high priest had touched upon; his question touched upon God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Consider Paul's judgment in Acts 23.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Pay particular attention to his change in attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was a person thoroughly dealt with by the Lord and was able to say a strong word to the Sanhedrin: "Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good conscience before God until this day" v. 1 . At that time Paul had difficulty with his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He could not see well, and he did not realize that the high priest was there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the high priest ordered those standing by Paul to strike him on the mouth, Paul said, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And do you sit to judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law you order me to be struck?" v. 3 . Paul was prophesying as well as reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was saying that it was unreasonable for a man to be struck before he is judged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not realize that the chairman of the Sanhedrin was the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When those around him rebuked him, saying, "Do you revile the high priest of God?", he realized that the high priest was the chairman, and he humbled himself and said, "I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evilly of the ruler of your people'" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Following this, in verse 6, Paul changed the tone of his conversation and no longer spoke as an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we see a man softening himself as soon as he touched authority.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul touched the authority of the high priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He could not speak to the high priest as if he was standing in God's place.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, Paul could consider himself equal with any king of the world; no one was greater than he was.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was God's ambassador.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet as soon as he touched God's authority, he humbled himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he found out that Ananias was God's high priest, he immediately humbled himself and subjected himself to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As workers of the Lord, we must come face to face with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Unless we do this, the principle governing our work will not be the principle of submission, but the principle of satanic rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to see God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, we will be selective in our obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we think that a certain person deserves obedience, we will obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we think that he does not deserve obedience, we will not obey him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must have a head-on encounter with authority at least once, before we know what authority really is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nothing in this world is more important than authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every time we touch authority, we are softened.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to be softened if we are to serve our God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Otherwise, we will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must find authority in the church, at work, and everywhere around us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the only way to know authority, and this is what qualifies us for God's service.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Truly we need a great revelation to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE PRINCIPLE OF SERVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Matthew 7:21-23 the Lord rebuked those who prophesied, cast out demons, and did works of power in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Why were they rebuked when they were doing these things in the Lord's name?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They were rebuked because they were doing these things out of themselves, not out of obedience to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the reason the Lord said that only "he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens" can enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The present age is full of lawlessness and rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sin is lawlessness and rebellion according to 1 John 3:4.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Being lawless is being without the law, and being without the law is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Satan sinned by trespassing against authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Man breaks the law when the law is present and acts irresponsibly when no law is present.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In either case he sins; that is, he does not come under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This has nothing to do with good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Evil is, of course, sin, but good is sin as well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Breaking the law is a matter of conduct, and it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Being lawless is a matter of motive, and it is sin as well.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In lawlessness one not only rebels against authority but acts as if there is no law.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the end times the presence of the lawless one will result in fallen man overturning all forms of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He will act according to his self-will and lawlessness will reign.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There will be less and less expression of authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day, even parental authority, spousal authority, school authority, governmental authority, and all other forms of authority will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>From the time of Satan's fall, throughout man's history of transgression to the end of this age, Satan is continually fighting against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Man is also standing against God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God establishes authority, but man rebels against it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Rebellion constitutes the underlying principle of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to serve God, we have to experience authority.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to free ourselves from these two worldly principles lawlessness and rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must realize that there are two principles in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>One is the principle of God's authority, and the other is the principle of Satan's rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We cannot serve God on the one hand and take the way of rebellion on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We cannot serve God in a spirit of rebellion and enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A rebellious man can give a message, but Satan will laugh at such a man because he is operating under Satan's principle.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Service is directly linked to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we do not settle the matter of authority, we will have problems in all areas of our service and living.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have to ask ourselves if we are under God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As servants of God we have to have a fundamental revelation, a revelation of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We have to face our pathway accurately and squarely.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to know that any kind of rebellion is from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Those who have not seen authority are destroying their own work.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We may say that we are destroying Satan's work, but actually we are working according to Satan's principle.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This will lead us nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Unless we touch authority and its underlying root, God will not be able to have any work in China, in other places, and in the entire world.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we do not remove the root of rebellion, we will have no future and no work.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>May the Lord be merciful to us and grant us a real touch with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>May we turn away from the principle of rebellion and reject the way of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>May the Lord preserve our service in the principle of submission.</S>
