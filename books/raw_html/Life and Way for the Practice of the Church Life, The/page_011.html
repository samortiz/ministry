<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LIFE TO PRACTICE THE CHURCH LIFE</H1><P>As we have mentioned in the previous chapter, the parables spoken by the Lord in Matthew 13 show us that the purpose, the intention, of the Lord in giving Himself to us as life is to bring forth the church as His Body. They also show us how the enemy has come in to frustrate the Lord's purpose by damaging, spoiling, and corrupting the Body of Christ. But praise the Lord, eventually, the church will be built up with gold, precious stones, and pearls through the transformation of life. Ultimately, there will be a city built with gold, precious stones, and pearls as the ultimate consummation of the people of God (Rev. 21:18-21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR NEED FOR THE TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE</H2><P>First Corinthians 3 tells us that the church is, on the one hand, God's cultivated land, and on the other hand, God's building (v. 9). On the one hand, we have to grow as God's farm by the life which is Christ Himself as the seed sown into us. On the other hand, we have to be transformed by this divine life into precious materials for the building up of the church. Then we will have the real church life.</P><P>Usually, when we talk about the practice of the church life or the practice of the Body life, immediately we begin to consider how to form or organize something according to our human thought. But we need to realize that the practice of the church life is not a matter of formation or organization. It is a matter of the growth in life and the transformation in life. Christ has to grow up in you, and you have to grow up in Christ. Moreover, we natural men have to be transformed into precious stones. If we try to form or organize a church, we are foolish. That means we have not learned from the history of the church and that we are going to repeat the past mistakes.</P><P>Our burden is not to teach people to be religious. What we need is to know Christ as the transforming life. Today the Lord is doing a hidden work of transformation in us. We do not need to be formed or organized, but we need to be transformed into precious materials for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>You have been regenerated, so you have Christ Himself as the very life to grow in you and to transform you. You may know you have Christ in you as life, but how much have you been transformed by this divine life? I do not mean how much you have changed in your behavior. The Lord being life to us is for transforming us in our nature metabolically, not for changing or correcting our behavior outwardly. Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism attempt to change the outward behavior, but the Lord's being life to us is to transform our inward nature.</P><P>You may have some changes in your behavior and some corrections in your actions due to some good, sound Christian teachings, but it is quite possible that you do not have any transformation accomplished within you. Corrections come from outward teachings, but transformation comes from the inner life. Suppose a certain brother is proud. After he hears a message telling him that pride is damaging, he receives the help and makes a decision to be humble. Perhaps he succeeds outwardly, but this is mere outward correction, an outward change in his behavior. This is not the transformation in life.</P><P>What is the transformation in life? May the Lord open our eyes so that we can see that Christ is life in us. Regardless of how good or how bad we are, we have been put to death, terminated, crucified. Today it is Christ who lives in us (Gal. 2:20). As genuine Christians, we do not need to correct our conduct or adjust our behavior. We need to see that Christ is our life and that we have been crucified with Christ. One day we will pass through such a crisis, and we will see such a vision. Then we will seek to experience Christ in our practical daily life, not just to know Christ in doctrine. We will seek and pray, "Lord, let me know the practical way to take You as life in my daily life." When we know the way to take Christ as life, day by day we will be filled with Christ, occupied with Christ, and saturated with Christ. We will be persons full of Christ.</P><P>What is the practical way to take Christ as life? The most important thing is for us to realize that Christ today within us is the law of life (Heb. 8:10; Rom. 8:2) and the anointing (1 John 2:20, 27). To have the doctrinal teaching that Christ has sown Himself into us to be the life in us is not sufficient. Look at our daily life. By what life do we live? By Christ or by ourselves? Does the fact that Christ is life within us and that we have been put on the cross have any influence on us? Is there always a checking of the cross in our daily life&#151;in whatever we say, whatever we do, and wherever we go? The problem is that we know the fact, but we still live by ourselves.</P><P>The building of the church absolutely depends on the transformation in life. We have to be transformed. If you take Christ as your life practically in your daily life and are checked by the cross all the time, you will have a different view concerning the church life. Your view will be changed. You need to put this into practice. Then you will know where you are, and you will know the real church life. If you are still living by yourself, your view concerning the church will be natural. When you deny yourself to take Christ as your life and are willing to be checked by the cross in all your daily affairs, your view about the church life will be changed and even revolutionized because you are being transformed.</P><P>The more we talk about the doctrine, the more we will be in darkness about the church life; our inner eyes will be veiled. But if we are willing to be checked by the cross all day long in all things and to take Christ as life in every matter, our eyes will be opened and the veils will be gone. Then we will see the church, the Body of Christ, and the church life, the Body life.</P>
