   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Matthew 19:27 20:16 we have the reward of the kingdom and the parable of the kingdom reward.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kingdom reward is of two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first part is in this age, and is mainly related to material things and natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second part is in the coming age, in the manifestation of the kingdom, with an enjoyment of the divine life that is fuller than the enjoyment in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter said to the Lord, "Behold, we have left all and followed You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What then will there be for us?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>19:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the Lord said that many but not all who are first will be last, and the last first v. 30 . This indicates that many, like Peter, who were the first would be the last to receive the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord said this in order to revolutionize Peter's commercial mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Receiving the reward is not a commercial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, the price we pay means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What could we pay to receive the full enjoyment of eternal life in the manifestation of the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, what we pay is refuse Phil 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reward is not a legal matter but a matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be saved is to receive grace, and to gain the reward is to enjoy the grace we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Immediately after the Lord unveiled His death and resurrection the third time, the mother of James and John came to Him asking that her two sons might sit on His right hand and left hand in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although the Lord had spoken of the crucifixion and the resurrection, their mind was set on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the ambition for position.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we ask to sit on the throne in the kingdom, we must be prepared to drink the cup of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To suffer the cross is the way to enter into the kingdom Acts 14:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matthew 21 marks the beginning of the Lord's last week on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The heavenly King came not with haughty splendor, but with gentle, humble meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This impression of meekness is strengthened by the colt accompanying a donkey to bear the meek King.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The people honored the Lord with their clothing, that is, with whatever they had, and they spread palm branches in the road recognizing that He was the One with the victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord entered the city of Jerusalem, the first thing He did was cleanse the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His heart was not for His kingdom, but for God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the same in principle with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the day He came into us to be our life and our King, He did not enthrone Himself, but cleansed God's temple, which today is our spirit, the habitation of God Eph 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the cleansing, the Lord healed the blind and the lame in the temple Matt 21:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that His cleansing of the temple causes people to have the sight to see and the strength to move.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord cursed the fig tree a symbol of the nation of Israel because it was full of leaves but fruitless, signifying that at that time the nation of Israel was full of outward show but had nothing that could satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The concern of the meek King is for God's house and God's satisfaction.</S>
