   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX THE PIOUS EXPRESSIONS OF THE PSALMISTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UTTERED OUT OF THEIR COMPLEX SENTIMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WHILE ENJOYING GOD IN HIS HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>PSALMS 52 67 3 Scripture Reading: Psa 63 67</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our appreciation of the Bible, in particular of the Psalms, depends upon the kind of discernment we have.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as the discernment and appreciation of a mature person differs from that of a child, so our appreciation of the Bible differs according to our degree of spiritual experience, understanding, and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a vast difference between what an aged grandfather would value and appreciate and what a two-year-old child would value and appreciate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us suppose that a number of items are placed before them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among these items the child may appreciate a small, beautiful, empty, round box, but to the grandfather this box and all the items he sees before him are worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What he appreciates and desires is a great diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that we appreciate things according to our maturity and our capacity to discern what is of real value.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whereas some will appreciate Ephesians 3, a chapter on God's eternal economy and the preaching of the unsearchable riches of Christ to the Gentiles according to God's plan to produce the church, others may appreciate a portion such as Psalm 65:11-13, which speaks of God's crowning the year with His goodness, His paths overflowing with fatness, the hills girding themselves with exultation, and the valleys shouting for joy and singing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this message we will consider Psalms 63 67.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we read these psalms, we need to exercise adequate discernment so that we may realize how these psalms compare to the standard of the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE PSALMIST COMPARING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>HIS ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN HIS HOUSE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>WITH THE PUNISHMENT OF HIS ENEMIES</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Psalm 63 the psalmist compares his enjoyment of God in His house with the punishment of his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, the psalmist treasures the enjoyment of God; on the other hand, he also rejoices in God's punishment of his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. The Psalmist's Seeking After God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verses 1 through 4 the psalmist says, "O God, You are my God; I seek You diligently./My soul thirsts for You,/My flesh faints in longing for You,/In a dry and weary land without water./So I have looked upon You in the sanctuary, /Seeing Your power and Your glory./Because Your lovingkindness is better than life,/My lips praise You./Thus I bless You while I live;/I lift up my hands in Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To seek God and thirst for Him are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, we need to ask these questions: For what do we seek after God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For what do we thirst for God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In our seeking and thirsting, are we looking for something that is of great spiritual value?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For what was the psalmist seeking God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the Divine Trinity or the life-giving Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It seems that the psalmist was seeking mainly for God's lovingkindness v. 3 . The poetic writing here is marvelous, but the contents are very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, some readers of these verses may highly appreciate them.</S>
