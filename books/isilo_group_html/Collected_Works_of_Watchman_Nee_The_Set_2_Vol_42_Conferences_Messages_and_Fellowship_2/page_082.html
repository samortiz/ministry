Ephesians 4:1 says that since we are called, we should "walk" worthily of this calling. If a man has never sat, he can never walk. To sit is to rest. It indicates that everything is done, or that someone else has done all the work. This is like riding in the car or on a boat; someone else is moving the vehicle. We can sit in the same way because the Lord has done everything. He has done everything for us; He has identified Himself with us, and He has given us His life. When did God create Adam and Eve? He created them on the sixth day. Hence, the seventh day for God is the first day for man. Man's first day is God's Sabbath day. As soon as man was created, he entered into God's rest. If we cannot sit, it must mean that we have not yet received salvation. There was only one person who entered the Holy of Holies to make atonement for sins&mdash;the high priest. Even ordinary priests were not allowed to enter (Heb. 9:7). The curtains of the tabernacle kept outsiders away from the sanctuary. God wants us to make no mistake about this&mdash;He does not want man to have any share in the matter of redemption. As far as man's forgiveness is concerned, he "sits" on the Lord's redemption. It is not a matter of serving God or seeking for salvation. God has freely given us the grace of forgiveness. Both the problem of sin and the problem of the old man are dealt with by "sitting." If we have never sat down, we can never do any work. Wherever faith is, there is no work. Everything has been accomplished by God already; all we have to do is receive.</p><p>If we can sit, God will make us walk. The second section, Ephesians 4:1&mdash;6:9, is on walking. Ephesians 4:17 says, "That you no longer walk." Verse 19 says, "To work all uncleanness in greediness." Verse 22 says, "Your former manner of life, the old man." Ephesians 5:2 says, "Walk in love." Verse 8 says, "Walk as children of light." Verse 11 speaks of "unfruitful works," and verse 12 speaks of "the things which are done." Verse 15 says, "Look therefore carefully how you walk." Ephesians 6:8 speaks of "whatever good thing each ones does." This portion of the Word repeatedly and emphatically mentions the matter of a Christian's walk.</p><p>Please remember that not only are we in the Lord, but the Lord is also in us. Once we are connected to Christ, His life will flow into us and we will be able to walk. This is like the electric light bulb; when the bulb is connected to the current from the power plant, electricity will be in the bulb and the bulb will light up. First God operates, and then we walk. Without God's operation in Ephesians 3:20, it would be impossible to have the walk of chapter four. First we overcome, and then we go into battle. Christ's salvation first brings in rest and then brings in a walk, unlike other religions which work first and then achieve something later.</p><p>Ephesians 4:2-16 tells us how we should relate to the brothers and sisters, to the church, and to the Body of Christ. Verse 3 speaks of the oneness of the Spirit. Paul said that we should "keep" the oneness of the Spirit, rather than "striving at" the oneness of the Spirit. Verses 17 through 24 tell us what we should do concerning our former manner of life. Verse 22 speaks of a putting off. A putting off is not a change. An experience of putting off is a precious one. The Lord has crucified our old man already; we only have to put off the old man as regards its former manner of life.</p><p>Ephesians 4:25&mdash;5:14 draws special attention to the words we speak with our mouth. Ephesians 4:17-24 deals with one's conduct, while Ephesians 4:25&mdash;5:14 deals with one's words. In Ephesians 5:15-21 the most crucial point is the filling of the Spirit and thanksgiving and praise. We can put Ephesians 5:15-21 together with the previous section. Ephesians 5:22-33 shows husbands and wives what each should do, Ephesians 6:1-4 shows parents and children what each should do, and Ephesians 6:5-9 shows masters and slaves what each should do.</p><p>Let us summarize the second section: (1) Keeping the oneness of the Spirit and not offending the brothers, because this grieves the Spirit. (2) Putting off the old man. The putting off of the old man is related to the growth of the new life within. This is like the shedding of old leaves from a tree. When new leaves grow, the newness of their life replaces the old leaves. (3) Paying attention to our speaking. We have to be delivered from all kinds of negative speakings. Our conver- sation should not be focused on the brothers and sisters, but should be words of thanksgiving and praise. (4) Giving a word to husbands and wives, with the emphasis being on the wives. According to God's conviction and commitment, the goodness of the woman lies in her testimony of submission. I wish I could be a woman so that I could submit. Christ was equal with God, yet as the Son, He submitted to God in everything (Phil. 2:6, 8; Heb. 5:8). In the same way, the wife is equal with the husband, yet she is willing to be submissive in everything. Submission is a sign of meekness. The Lord honors the woman by asking her to submit. This means that the Lord places higher hopes on the woman. (5) Giving a word to parents and children. Parents have to nurture their children in the discipline and admonition of the Lord. The word "nurture" means "to bring up." Many parents want to send their children to the Lord, yet they themselves do not go along. Some say to their children, "I am a grown-up; therefore, I can smoke. You are a child; therefore, you cannot smoke. When you grow up, then you can smoke." This kind of teaching is wrong. The parents must bring up their children. This means that they have to be a pattern for their children to follow. (6) Giving a word to masters and slaves. Slaves should not try to be equal with their masters. They should be obedient to their masters according to the flesh, as to Christ. Many people do not like to hire believers as servants, because brothers who serve as servants often think that they are the same as their masters because they both are brothers. Therefore, they think that they should be treated better, instead of being treated simply as servants. This is wrong. A brother who is serving as a servant should serve his master all the more diligently and should be obedient to his master, as to Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THIRD SECTION:<br />OUR WITHSTANDING BEFORE SATAN&mdash;STAND</h2><p>The third section of Ephesians begins with chapter six, verse 10 and goes to the end of the book. It is the "final" word. The final word concerns the way to deal with Satan. We must first understand that we are seated with Christ in the heavenlies and then understand our proper walk on earth. Finally, we need to know how to deal with God's enemy, Satan. Paul told us to put on the whole armor of God so that we can stand. It says to stand because we do not overcome Satan by our fighting. The Lord has overcome and placed us in the position of victory. All we have to do is to stand and withstand. None of God's armor is for attacking; it is all defensive. Chapter two says that we are seated in the heavenlies. Sitting means that we have overcome the powers and principalities. Now we only need to maintain this stand. Chapter six does not mention any actual warfare; it only mentions withstanding. If a person realizes that he only needs to withstand and that everything is done, he will encounter no problems.</p><p>Thank the Lord that we are seated with Christ in the heavenlies. Now we can walk on earth before men, and we can stand to withstand Satan. Thank God that we can "sit," "walk," and "stand."</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_081.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_083.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 82</div><br></body></html>
