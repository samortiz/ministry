   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not eat the priest's food or wear the priestly garments.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He sent firstly twelve and then seventy to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This preaching of the gospel was to get sinners saved to become the followers of Jesus, and the followers of Jesus were to become the members of Christ that the Body of Christ might be built up to fulfill God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As New Testament believers, we must fulfill our priesthood to get sinners regenerated to become the members of the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The primary thing that every co-worker, elder, and serving one in the church must do is to bring forth fruit.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tree of life in Revelation 22 is the vine in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus said that we believers are the branches of this vine, and the branches of this vine are for bearing fruit John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not bear fruit, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should bear at least one fruit a year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God firstly created one man, but He desired to have many men for His purpose.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We read the Bible because we must bear fruit, we pray because we must bear fruit, and we are victorious and overcoming because we must bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fruit-bearing is not for the Bible or for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, everything is for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have many things today, including Bible reading, Bible study, and prayers, but the one thing we lack is fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An orchard is for fruit-bearing, not for making a show.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is meaningless to keep an orchard clean and in order but not have fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is better to have a messy orchard that is full of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not have fruit-bearing, we cannot have the increase, and if we do not have the increase, we cannot build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .</S>
