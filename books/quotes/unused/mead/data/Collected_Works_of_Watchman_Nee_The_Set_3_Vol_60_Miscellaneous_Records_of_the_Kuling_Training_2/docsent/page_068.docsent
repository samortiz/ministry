   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE A CHRISTIAN AND HIS COUNTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a person is saved, he has to deal with the matter of his country.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although this is a secular issue, it is very important to the individual walk of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How should a Christian deal with his country?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A new believer has to take care of this matter properly in order not to err in his walk.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE LORD'S POSITION ON EARTH The Lord Not Coming</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>to Enforce the Law</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When our Lord was on the earth, He maintained His position wherever He went.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He never acted as a law enforcer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He never tried to enforce any law, whether civil or criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Gospel of Luke tells us of two brothers who came to the Lord for help in dividing their possessions, but the Lord refused to do it 12:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Old Testament does contain commandments for dividing the house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord was not forbidding them from dividing their house.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But it was not a matter of whether or not the act was justified, but whether it was right for the Lord to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not come to judge family affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 8:3-11 the Pharisees brought before the Lord a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They wanted the Lord to condemn her to death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They asked, "In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What then do you say?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they kept pressing Him, He stood up and said, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When they heard this, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord then said to the woman, "Has no one condemned you?...Neither do I condemn you."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord was not saying that the woman should not be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, He was showing that He did not come to condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not come to execute the law, civil or criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was not His concern.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was the position the Lord took when He was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was always firm in this position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Having Nothing to Do</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>with Politics</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord was on the earth, He was very meek.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not seek the greatness of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Jews hoped that He would be their king, but He ignored this wish.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not touch the matter of politics at all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Catholicism has mixed itself up with politics completely.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The edicts of popes are often political maneuvers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our Lord never touched politics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When He was on the earth, many Jews were ready to die for Him if He would only agree to be their king.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the Lord would not be their king.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This does not mean that He did not have the power to reform the political system or to save the Jewish nation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His goal on earth was to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His work was spiritual, not worldly; it had nothing to do with politics.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord did not enter Jerusalem on a fine horse in great pomp.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He came on a colt in humility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Jews wanted to kill Him because He claimed to be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He had proclaimed Himself the king of the Jews, the Jews would not have killed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before He was crucified, He was judged twice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One of these times the high priest said, "I charge You...to tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus answered, "You have said rightly," and the high priest condemned Him based on this word Matt 26:63-66 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since the high priest did not have the authority to put the Lord Jesus to death, he handed Him to Pilate who asked, "Are You the king of the Jews?"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>27:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Pilate was not concerned about whether or not He was the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His fear was political.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was afraid that the Jews would make Jesus their king.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The interesting thing is that no one knew who the Lord was.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one knew if He was indeed a politically controversial figure.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For two thousand years the world has been puzzled by Christianity in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some have said that Christianity has been used by some as a religious tool to achieve political ends.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the Lord Jesus was condemned, His verdict, written in three languages, read: "This is the king of the Jews."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But the world does not understand that the Lord had no interest in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said that His kingdom was not of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that the kingdom of the Lord is not within the political arena but apart from it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the position our Lord took.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Psalm 110:1 the Father says to the Son, "Sit at My right hand/Until I make Your enemies/Your footstool."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>During the age of grace, our Lord does not take charge directly of the affairs of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is waiting for the day when God makes His enemies His footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hebrews 12:28 and Acts 14:22 clearly tell us that the kingdom we have received is God's kingdom; it has nothing to do with politics.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God has established a kingdom in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This kingdom includes many nations of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His people enter this kingdom through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This kingdom does not have any territory, army, or politics.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In this kingdom there is only God's rule to govern man's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This kingdom is called the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The position of this kingdom is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord is not behind any nation on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He has set up a spiritual kingdom to rule over His people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When He comes again, His authority will fill the whole earth Dan 2:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Out of His mouth will come a sharp two-edged sword, which is His living word.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This sword will smite the nations Rev 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At this time the prayer of the robber who was crucified with the Lord will be answered, who prayed for remembrance at the time of the coming of the Lord in His kingdom Luke 23:42.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Revelation 6:9 says that when the fifth seal was opened, the souls of those who were martyred for God's word and the testimony of Jesus would cry to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Their prayers were for God's interest and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should follow their footsteps and refrain from political involvement.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should not fall prey to political agendas.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our purpose on earth is to advance God's heavenly kingdom.</S>
