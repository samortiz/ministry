But how many of us know that we are not just believers but members as well? We know that part of the Adamic life is sinful and natural, and we have to deal with both of these things. However, we also have to deal with the individualistic life. What is the individualistic life? It is the life that exists independently, lives independently, and acts independently. It is the life which lives as if it is the only life on this earth. This individualistic life frustrates us from being blended into the Body of Christ. We must realize that the opposite of the Body is individualism. In order to be blended into the Body, we have to be delivered from our individualism.</p><p>The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is something that we have to enter into. If we do not enter into the Body, we will not know the Body. Those who are saved can easily spot those who are not yet saved. In the same way, those who are in the Body can easily spot those who are not in the Body. At the time you were saved, you did not merely hear the doctrine of salvation; you saw Christ as a vibrant life. Some are in the Body of Christ already, while others are not in it. Brothers and sisters, when you were saved, you were brought into a new realm. After you entered that new realm, you clearly could see the condition of those who were not saved. In the same way, those who are living in the Body clearly see the condition of those who are not in the Body. Those who are not in the Body of Christ feel that they are the only person living on the earth and that they are everything. A man can understand the book of Romans and still not be saved. In the same way, a man can understand the book of Ephesians and still not see the Body of Christ. We are delivered from sin, and we are in Christ. It is true that we are saved, but we need another salvation that delivers us from individualism into the Body of Christ.</p><p>It is all right for us to live as individuals, but it is not all right for us to be individualistic. God allows us to be individuals, but He does not allow us to be individualistic. Before we enter the Body of Christ, we are saturated with individualism; even our spiritual pursuit is based on our individualism. Why do we want to be holy? We want to be holy for ourselves. Why do we want power? We want power for ourselves. Why do we want fruit for our work? We want fruit for ourselves. Why do we pursue the kingdom? We pursue it because we ourselves want to gain it. Why are we seeking? We are seeking for ourselves. Everything is centered around "ourselves." But this is not the Body. This is individualism. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand people were saved. We may think that it would be wonderful if we could save three thousand in one day and bear so much fruit, but we have to remember that eleven apostles also stood up together with Peter. Did the other apostles say, "Peter can save men, and so can we. Is Peter the only one who can have a platform and who can save men?" We know, of course, that no such words were spoken. God is not after individual vessels; He is after a corporate vessel. Those who have genuinely seen the Body of Christ are not jealous of others. It does not matter who is doing the work. Everything is in the Body and has nothing to do with individuals.</p><p>Therefore, we must consider ourselves not only as believers but also as members. I am a member; therefore, I am not the whole or even the half. I am only a small part of the Body. If you see the Body and see that you are only a member, this will be a great salvation to you. In the past you might have considered everything in an individualistic way. Your work was an individual work, and your life was an individual life. Everything was individual. When you see the Body, you are spontaneously delivered from individualism. You see Christ, and then you are saved. In the same principle, you see the Body, and then you are spontaneously delivered from individualism to become a member. You do not look at a situation that confronts you and then deliberate whether or not you should act according to the principle of the Body. Rather, you receive the vision and revelation and are brought into the Body. Then spontaneously you act according to the principle of the Body. Once your natural life is dealt with, you spontaneously see that you are a member.</p><p>What does being a member mean? It means that all of our work and living are based on the Body; the Body is the unit of operation. When my hands work, it is not my hands that are working, but my body that is working. When my feet walk, it is not my feet that are walking, but my body that is walking. Every move of the members has the Body as its unit of operation. What one member does is what the whole Body does. When the members walk, the Body is walking. Nothing that the members do is for themselves. Everything that the members do is for the Body. Every move of the members is based on the Body, not on the members. We are happy if God puts us in the first place, and equally happy even if He puts us in the last place. Only the ones who do not see the Body can be proud, and only they can be jealous of others.</p><p>We have to see the relationship between the members and the Body. A member cannot replace the Body; yet it can affect the Body. Even our personal failures or uncleanness affect the Body. Although no one knows or sees our own personal, hidden failures, the devil knows and sees. When a member fails, the Body is affected. Therefore, our pursuit of a life of love, holiness, and spiritual growth is something for the Body.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we should ask ourselves, "Are we independent persons, or are we members? Are we merely believers, or are we members?" Brothers and sisters, it is true that we are Christians, but when we contact others, we may be at odds with them in less than five minutes; we cannot be one with them. This proves that we are not living as a member. The Lord is not satisfied with this. May He give us light so that we will have a clear vision of this. Once we see the Body, spontaneously we will be delivered from individualism, and spontaneously we will become living members.</p><p>If our individualism is not smashed, God cannot secure a vessel to fulfill His plan or express the fullness of Christ. God wants a Body to be His vessel. Yet this vessel can only be realized when all the members are joined together as a Body; anything less falls short of God's goal.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_074.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_076.html">Next</a> </body></html>
