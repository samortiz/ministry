<h1 class="title">BLESSINGS AND GRACE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:8-9; Eccl. 1:2; Matt. 6:31-32; Luke 14:33; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 4:7; 12:9; Phil. 3:8; 4:11-13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE GRACE OF GOD HAVING TWO ASPECTS</h2>
<p>The relationship between man and the grace that God bestows on man has two aspects. One aspect involves the procedure, and the other aspect involves the goal. God has a goal concerning man, and He must have a procedure in order to reach this goal. Hence, His relationship with man involves a procedure. In regard to His procedure, God bestows outward blessings, and in regard to His goal, He supplies inward grace. Both aspects are indispensable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GOAL</h2>
<p>In eternity past God had a good pleasure, which was to enter into man and be joined to man so that man would have His life and nature. According to this good pleasure, God made a plan with the goal of entering into man to be man&rsquo;s life and element. God had this unique goal in eternity past before time began, that is, before He created the heavens and the earth. From eternity past to eternity future God is working to accomplish His goal of entering into man so that man may be joined to Him. God&rsquo;s relationship with man, the grace He gives man, and the things He does in relation to man are for Him to accomplish His glorious goal. He will achieve His goal when He is fully mingled with and joined to man in eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PROCEDURE</h2>
<p>In order to accomplish His desire and goal, God created man. Before creating man, He created everything in the universe and thus prepared everything that man would need in order to live. He created the earth for man to have a dwelling place, and He also created air, the sun, and food for man&rsquo;s existence. After creating everything that man would need for his existence, God created man. Hence, immediately after man was created, he was able to enjoy everything that God had prepared: there was the earth to dwell on, air to breathe, light from the sun, and food to eat. Man had all that he needed for his existence.</p>
<p>Although God had prepared everything that man needed, this preparation did not accomplish God&rsquo;s goal in man. Rather, these things were but a procedure for God to reach His goal. In order for this goal to be accomplished, man must have a way to exist, and in order for man to exist, God had to prepare everything that man needed for his existence. Hence, the things that God created were not His goal; they were His procedure. In view of God&rsquo;s relationship with man, the things that were created were part of His procedure; they were not His goal. Hence, the things that God gives to man do not convey grace; they are outward blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUTWARD BLESSINGS</h2>
<p>Outward blessings refer to the material things that God bestows on man and to the physical environment that God prepares for man&rsquo;s existence. Whether it be people, matters, things, or environments, everything that man enjoys for his existence is an outward blessing given by God. What Adam enjoyed in the garden of Eden was outward blessings. Although those things were prepared for him by God, they were outward things, material in nature, and related to the environment.</p>
<p>Outward blessings are material and are related to man&rsquo;s existence. They are God&rsquo;s procedure, not His goal. Those who live only according to outward blessings are living in God&rsquo;s procedure; they are not in God&rsquo;s goal. Although they may enjoy many material things, their heart is still empty because they are only in God&rsquo;s procedure. This is revealed in Solomon&rsquo;s experience. Solomon did not lack outward material things; he even had a surpassing abundance of material things. He had all the possible enjoyment that a man can have in the material realm. Nevertheless, he said, &ldquo;Vanity of vanities; all is vanity&rdquo; (Eccl. 1:2), because material things are not the goal of God in man and thus cannot satisfy man&rsquo;s inner need.</p>
<p>Material things are for man&rsquo;s existence so that man may reach God&rsquo;s goal. However, after man&rsquo;s fall the enjoyment of material things usurped man, causing man to want material things instead of God&rsquo;s goal. Man enjoys the things that God created without caring for the goal of creation. Hence, when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He wanted man to forsake all things. He said, &ldquo;Everyone of you who does not forsake all his own possessions cannot be My disciple&rdquo; (Luke 14:33). The expression <em>all his own possessions</em> refers to the outward material blessings prepared by God for man&rsquo;s existence. If man highly regards such things, he will neglect God&rsquo;s goal. If we want to receive only the outward things that God prepared as the procedure, it will be difficult for us to receive the grace that God prepares for us to reach His goal. In other words, if we enjoy outward blessings but disregard God&rsquo;s goal, it will be difficult for us to receive the grace that God has prepared for us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Operation of God and the Anointing &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
