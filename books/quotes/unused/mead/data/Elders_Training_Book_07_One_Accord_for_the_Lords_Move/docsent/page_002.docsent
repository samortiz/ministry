   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE ONE ACCORD Gk. homothumadon from homo, same, and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>thumos, mind, will, purpose soul, heart Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:24; 5:12; 15:25; Rom 15:6; 12:16; 1 Cor 1:10; 2 Cor 13:11; Phil 1:27; 2:2; 4:2 A TRAINING OF PRACTICES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our fellowship in this elders training of 1986 will not be that much in vision, teaching, or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My burden to have this training is absolutely for the practice.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since October of 1984, the Lord has begun something new in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some brothers from the United States went to Taiwan and they got burned with the fire of the Lord s new move.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They came back to the United States with this fire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because I dared not control, restrict, or quench this fire which has begun in the United States, I had a burden to pass on some practical points of fellowship according to the urgent need.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Again, this is a training of practices, not doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The troubles that Christianity has been suffering always come from two sources doctrines and practices.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Most of the debates are concerning the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Doctrines, of course, bring in practices, and practices follow doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Testament gives us the vision, the revelation, concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following the revelation are the practices.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not true to say that some of the practices in the New Testament are not according to the revelation concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, every practice in the New Testament is according to the divine revelation, the heavenly vision, of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Throughout our history in the Lord s recovery, all of our practices have been according to what we have seen of the Lord s revelation, of the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need such a training concerning how to take care of the practical side of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just to talk about the recovery is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just to say that you are in the recovery, for the recovery, and one with the recovery does not mean too much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is like a kite in the air and is not something solid on the rock which could never be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have been in the recovery for over half a century.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have never been shaken and nothing has ever changed us because we have seen not only the doctrines, the visions, the revelation concerning the church, but also the practices.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since October of 1984 in Taiwan we have seen and discovered something more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The practices among us have been radically changed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even up to the present time, however, many who are very positive for the Lord s recovery are not clear about what I am doing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PROBLEM OF AMBITION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>AMONG THE ELDERS AND CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the book of Revelation there are no elders in the churches; rather, there are the messengers who are the stars Rev 1:16, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the time this book was written, the church had become degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, in Revelation, the Lord repudiates all formalities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being an elder may be somewhat legal or formal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not desire to be an elder; desire to be a shining star.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not be one with a mere position be a shining star.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s recovery has been with us for over sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was under the leadership of Brother Watchman Nee on mainland China for the first thirty years, from 1922 to 1952.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The eldership greatly bothered us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was not taking the lead in the recovery at that time, but I was always under Brother Nee s umbrella.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He talked to me personally about the problem of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since I came out of mainland China to Taiwan and then to the United States, over the past thirty-seven years the matter of the eldership has caused me much concern and has burdened me to such an extent that I did not know how to deal with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is the main trouble?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we were having the training on Matthew in 1976 I illustrated that a wife of an elder is not like the first lady, the wife of the president.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the wives of the elders should consider themselves as wives of slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of the poor situation, nearly everyone has ambition in the matter of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This bothers me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1973 this ambition crept into the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since 1973 ambition was brought in and has been very much promoted and uplifted either secretly or openly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ambition has been growing up to be a real gopher in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to my observation, from 1973 until the present day we have missed the mark to some extent and have suffered much loss in the rate of increase.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The rate of increase in the Lord s recovery has been very much brought down by the ambition of the elders and by the ambition of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This ambition has damaged us very much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Throughout the past thirteen years I have been fighting against this very thing the ambition of the elders and the ambition of the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I really hate this ambition among us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have had some consideration that it might be better not to have a mere official eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should pay attention to the way revealed in Revelation where there are only messengers or stars and no elders.</S>
