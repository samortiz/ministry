   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 3 Scripture Reading: Exo 28:1-4; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Rev 1:6; 5:9-10; John 1:14; Heb 1:3; John 17:22; Luke 24:19 SIX ITEMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to 28:1-4, the priests were required to wear a particular kind of garment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today those who serve in the armed forces must wear an appropriate uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the same principle, as a group of serving ones, the priests in the Old Testament had to wear garments that were specially designed for the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Exodus 28:4 indicates that these garments included six main items: And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a tunic of woven work, a turban, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, and for his sons, to serve as priests to Me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The breastplate was built with twelve precious stones set in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ephod was underneath the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Hebrew word for ephod means to bind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The ephod worn by the priest was similar to a vest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To the ephod were attached the shoulder plates and the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The robe was a long garment that went from the shoulders down to the feet, covering the body of the priest in full.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God required that the priests be fully covered, that no part of their body would be naked.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is rather difficult to say what the tunic was.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It was shorter than the robe, probably reaching no farther than the knee.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the tunic may be compared to a short coat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to these four items, there were the turban and the girdle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The turban was a covering for the head, and the girdle was used for the girding of the loins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In forthcoming messages we shall consider these items of the priestly garments in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My concern in this message is that we have a general understanding of the significance of the priestly garments.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The priestly garments signify that those who serve God as priests must have a certain kind of expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The priestly garments can be compared to the uniform worn by a policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we see a man dressed in the uniform of a policeman, we know that this person is a policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A policeman s uniform is his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true of the garments worn by a judge in a courtroom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A policeman s uniform and a judge s robe illustrate the fact that clothing signifies expression.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the New Testament, the priestly garments signify the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every aspect of the priestly garments signifies an attribute or virtue of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the priestly garments are the serving ones expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Qualifying the Priests to Serve</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The priestly garments as the expression of the priests were their qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the priests had worn some other kind of garments, they would not have been qualified to serve as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once again we may use a policeman s uniform as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A policeman is required to wear the proper uniform when he is on duty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the uniform which qualifies him to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a policeman wore some other kind of clothing, even very fine, expensive clothing, he would not be qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be qualified he must wear a police uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same principle, the expression of Christ qualifies us to serve as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may claim to be priests, but do we have the expression of Christ to qualify us to serve as priests?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not we are qualified to be a priest is determined by the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This expression is our qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sanctifying the Priests</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The priestly garments also sanctify the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These garments separated them from all the other people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The same is true of a policeman in uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A police officer s uniform separates him from others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Should a man wearing a policeman s uniform approach you and speak to you, you would surely respect him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if someone without the proper uniform tried to act as if he were a policeman, you would not show him the same respect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>That person would not have the qualification signified by the uniform, and he would not be separated by this uniform from others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason, he would be regarded as no different from anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In like manner, the priests were sanctified, separated to God, by their garments.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Exodus 28:3 says, They shall make Aaron s garments to sanctify him to serve as priest to Me. In this verse sanctify means to separate to God for His unique purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The priests were sanctified by the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we express Christ, this expression will both qualify us and sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verses 2 and 4 of Exodus 28 speak of holy garments.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 3 says that Aaron s garments sanctified him to serve as a priest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The words holy and sanctify indicate that a priest of God should be separated to Him, set aside for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be separated and set aside in this way is to be holy, sanctified.</S>
