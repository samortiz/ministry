Those who are under thirty may think that the Lord&#8217;s recovery is their kingdom, and the ones over thirty may feel that they are useless and out of date. This concept is not accurate. In the Old Testament those under the age of thirty were not qualified to minister in or around the tabernacle, which was a type of the church today as the Lord&#8217;s testimony. Instead of being useless, those who are thirty and over are the ones most useful in caring for the tabernacle, for the church as the Lord&#8217;s testimony.<h2 class=head1>TWO IMPORTANT SERVICES</h2><p>In the Lord&#8217;s move there are two main types of service: the service for the tabernacle and the fighting. Today we must, on the one hand, maintain a strong and living testimony; on the other hand, we need to fight the battle. For the fighting of the battle, we need those under the age of thirty, but for maintaining the testimony, we need those thirty and over.<p>Because in the past we did not make it clear about these two services, some were confused and thought there was only one service and that it depended solely on the young people. Therefore, I am concerned that we see these two categories of service in the Lord&#8217;s move. Today many of the young people are on the campuses fighting to gain ground for the Lord. The older ones, however, are maintaining the testimony. This is much more important than fighting.<p>Many of the middle-aged and older brothers and sisters have become dislocated or disjointed members. It seems that the fingers have been functioning but that the shoulders have been dislocated. I hope that through this chapter and through the four chapters to follow all the members will be put back in the proper location.<h2 class=head1>AGE GROUPS AMONG THE LORD&#8217;S PEOPLE</h2><p>Various portions of the Old Testament speak of the different age groups among the Lord&#8217;s people (Exo. 30:12-16; Lev. 27:2-8; Num. 1:3; 4:3, 30, 46-49; 8:24-25). Because Exodus 30:12-16 deals with the matter of redemption, it makes no distinction among the age groups. From the standpoint of God&#8217;s redemption, we are all the same; we are all sinners. In Exodus 30:14 the age of twenty signifies the ability to bear responsibility before God as a full-grown man. Everyone twenty years of age and older had to give the same offering to the Lord, half a shekel. This half shekel, twenty gerahs, fulfilled the requirements of the ten commandments.<p>Exodus is a book of redemption, but Leviticus is a book of consecration. In redemption we all are the same, but in consecration there are differences. Leviticus 27:2-8 mentions various age groups: those from twenty to sixty, from five to twenty, from one month to five years, and those over sixty. In redemption everyone had the same value, half a shekel. In consecration, however, there are different evaluations for different ages. Among those from twenty to sixty, the male was worth fifty shekels and the female, thirty. Among those from five to twenty, the male was worth twenty and the female, ten. Among those from one month to five years, the male was worth five and the female, three. Finally, among those over sixty, the male was worth fifteen and the female, ten. Therefore, in Leviticus 27:2-8 there are four age levels, with the most valuable age being that between twenty and sixty. The testimony of the Lord depends mainly upon those in this age group. As we shall see, according to God&#8217;s scale the most important age for His testimony is the age between thirty and fifty.<p>Following Leviticus, we come to Numbers, a book of service. The Hebrew word which Darby renders &#8220;service&#8221; in Numbers 4:3 (&#8220;host&#8221; in KJV) has the meaning of military service and thus refers to warfare. God viewed the children of Israel in the wilderness as an army fighting for His testimony. Apparently the children of Israel were fighting for themselves. Actually, they were fighting for God&#8217;s testimony on earth, for among them was the tabernacle of the testimony, God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth. In this warfare there were two main functions: the function of fighting the enemies and the function of maintaining the tabernacle, which represented God&#8217;s testimony in the universe. Only those between the ages of thirty and fifty had the privilege of doing the work in and around the tabernacle. Those between twenty and thirty, however, were qualified for the military service, that is, for fighting the enemy. Numbers 1:3 says, &#8220;From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.&#8221; This indicates that those over the age of twenty were qualified for military service.<h2 class=head1>MAINTAINING THE LORD&#8217;S TESTIMONY</h2><p>Numbers 4:3 says, &#8220;From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the military service, to do the work in the tent of meeting&#8221; (Heb.). When the tabernacle was set up, those in this age group maintained it. When the children of Israel were traveling, those in this group also carried the various parts of the tabernacle and its utensils. Hence, those between the ages of twenty and thirty were the fighting ones, and those between the ages of thirty and fifty were the ones to maintain and carry the tabernacle.<p>Applying this type to today&#8217;s situation, we see that the young people are on the frontier fighting, but the older ones are at home maintaining the testimony. Maintaining the Lord&#8217;s testimony is more important than fighting. If there is no testimony, the young people are fighting in vain. Therefore, let us rise up and keep the testimony. Then the warfare in which the young people are engaged will be meaningful. The testimony today is the church. The middle-aged brothers and sisters must be those who set up the testimony, maintain it, and carry it from place to place. What a responsibility this is!<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR AN APPRENTICESHIP</h2><p>Numbers 8:24 mentions those who were twenty-five years of age. This was the age one began his apprenticeship, not for fighting, but for serving in the tabernacle. Probably no apprenticeship was necessary for fighting; however, in order to learn how to minister in the tabernacle, it was necessary to pass an apprenticeship of several years in length. A great deal of learning was necessary for this ministry. The years of apprenticeship were necessary and practical. Every aspect of the service in the tabernacle had to be exact; no mistakes were tolerated. Therefore, those who served in and around the tabernacle had to be thoroughly trained to do things accurately. After a Levite had completed his five-year apprenticeship, he was qualified, at the age of thirty, to serve in the tabernacle.<h2 class=head1>THE USEFULNESS OF THE YOUNGEST ONES</h2><p>Numbers 3:28 strangely mentions the male Levites &#8220;from a month old and upward,&#8221; indicating that they also were to keep the charge of the sanctuary. This verse reveals that even a very young one is useful in keeping the charge of the tabernacle. A baby a month old is, of course, not able to fight. However, he can help to keep the testimony.<p>Concerning the service or ministry in the tabernacle, there are in the book of Numbers three age groups: those between thirty and fifty, who were fully qualified to serve; those between twenty-five and thirty, who were engaged in an apprenticeship of five years to learn how to minister in the tabernacle; and those a month old and upward, who could keep the charge of the tabernacle. A baby a month old may not seem to be able to do anything, but he is a help for keeping the tabernacle. If a thousand little children were to surround our meeting hall, they would certainly be helping to keep it.<p>The service in Numbers is a picture of the church service. The church service does not depend mainly on the young people. For the service of the tabernacle, we need the little ones, from one month to twenty years of age; the apprentices, aged twenty-five to thirty; and those between the ages of thirty and fifty, who are fully qualified to serve. We need many more infants, toddlers, pre-schoolers, and those in elementary, junior high and high school. We need a great many more in this age group to surround the tabernacle.<p>You may think that such young ones are useless for God&#8217;s testimony, but God&#8217;s economy is different from our natural concept. According to Numbers 3, God would use even the infants to protect His testimony. We need to follow God&#8217;s strategy. This means that we need more young ones from one month to twenty years of age and we need enough older ones to take care of them. The churches in the Lord&#8217;s recovery need to become normal in this matter.<h2 class=head1>CARING FOR THE YOUNG ONES</h2><p>Among us there have been a number of brothers who were seeking eldership because of ambition. I am concerned that such a desire is still to be found in certain brothers today. Even the sisters may be ambitious for leadership. If you have this kind of ambition, you may be disappointed when someone else is made a leader. In the United States there is only one president. This does not mean, however, that of the more than two hundred million people in this country, there are none more intelligent or capable than the president. This country is maintained not only by the president but also by a great many other capable people. Although this illustration is not adequate, it may help us to see that in the church life we should not expect to be an elder or a leader. There are many ways to serve the Lord&#8217;s testimony.<p>In November 1975, all the elders and deacons in Taipei resigned, many of whom had held certain positions for more than twenty-five years. But after they resigned, the church there was revived and became very living. That was a church with twenty-three thousand members and seventeen meeting halls. In Anaheim there are only several hundred brothers and sisters. For this number we do not need very many elders, but we do need more brothers and sisters to take care of the young ones and of so many practical matters. It is impossible for every brother to be an elder or for every sister to be a leading sister. Let us drop the preoccupation with leadership and devote our attention to taking care of the young ones. We need some sisters who do not care to be leaders, but who are burdened to take care of the young people. What a shame to be ambitious for eldership and leadership!<p>We need those who are faithful to the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Such faithful ones are not preoccupied with leadership. Instead, they take care of the practicality of the church life. Where are the ones typified by the age group spoken of in Numbers 3:28? In today&#8217;s tabernacle of the Lord, we are short of them. There is no need for you to wait for an elder to ask you to care for some young ones. Simply pick up the burden and come together with others to pray. Tell the Lord that you are willing to be burdened for the young ones and to take care of them.<p>Often we emphasize the need to function in the meetings and encourage all the saints to function. But many who frequently give testimonies in the meeting function according to their eloquence, not according to the riches of Christ. We do not want testimonies of eloquence; we want testimonies of reality. Many of those who cannot speak eloquently feel useless in the meetings. They feel all the more useless when they consider that they are not elders or leaders of any kind. Hence, they are disappointed. Please forget about eldership and eloquence and begin to take care of the young ones.<h2 class=head1>TRAINING THE APPRENTICES</h2><p>We have seen that twenty-five was the age at which the Levites began their apprenticeship. We may also apply this to today&#8217;s situation. It is right that those under thirty be engaged in the fighting. However, when some reach the age of twenty-five, they should be willing to return to the tabernacle to learn how to care for the Lord&#8217;s testimony. Many have the aspiration to be elders, but along with this aspiration, they need to be trained. Furthermore, the elders should have the burden to train others. There may be four elders in a locality, but there should be many more apprentices. However, some churches have been in existence for years and yet no new elders have been produced there. For this reason, we are short of leaders.<p>After the summer conference in 1964, many brothers in Los Angeles were eager to move to other localities for the practice of the church life. However, I told them that it was not yet the right time for them to go out; and they needed to stay in Los Angeles for a period of time. Most took this word and remained. Those who did go out experienced failure and returned a few months later. In 1967 a number again felt that it was time to start the church life in other places. However, in one of the meetings I suggested that they stay in Los Angeles until 1970 and then begin the migrations. The migrations in 1970, 1971, and 1972 were successful. But some of the migrations that took place in 1973 suffered because the leadership was not adequate. We had depleted the leadership that had been developed. Therefore, the decision was made to consolidate certain churches. By this we see that it is not sufficient simply to aspire to be an elder. There is the need of training. Only through training can a brother become a proper elder.<p>All those who are presently elders should have both the desire and the ability to train the apprentices. In Taipei we have always had a number of apprentices, those learning to be elders. At every elders&#8217; training several brothers, some still in their twenties, attended as learners.<p>We are short not only of elders but also of leaders in the church service. In the past there has been too much organization in the church service. We strongly disapprove of organization, but we welcome life and living function. We do not have an organization; we have an organism. If the service functions when there is organization but stops otherwise, this is an indicator that the church is not normal. Instead of organizing things, we should learn to take care of the young ones and to train the apprentices. Even in the church service there is the need of learning.<h2 class=head1>SHEPHERDING AND MINISTERING LIFE</h2><p>Whenever a matter pertaining to the service is put in your hand, do not organize anything. Instead, exercise your spirit to pray and to minister life to others. The best shepherding takes place in the context of the church service. The reason for this is that all the leaders of the service groups spontaneously are shepherds. However, in practice, many of the leaders have functioned as organizers, not as shepherds. It is easy to organize, but to shepherd requires considerable exercise of spirit, patience, and love. It also demands that we minister life to others, even to those who are not so open. Do not neglect the ones you regard as useless. It is your responsibility to care for them, to make them living, and to help them to grow in life. In other words, you need to make them useful. This does not come by organizing; it comes by praying, shepherding, nourishing, and ministering life to them with patience. Do not concentrate on the ones you think are the best. Instead, pay attention to the ones who seem to be useless ones, even the worldly ones. The right way is to care for a certain worldly one, ministering life to him, until a transformation has taken place in him. This is not the way of organizing; it is the way of shepherding by praying and ministering life.<p>Some elders and co-workers still have the concept and attitude that they cannot do anything with those who do not seem to be promising. Sometimes I have asked the elders in certain places why they have not produced any useful ones. The reason for the lack is that they have not trained anyone. Forty years ago, in my home town of Chefoo we trained the brothers and sisters. We were like carpenters making furniture. If we could not obtain the best wood, we used whatever wood was available. And if there was no wood, we used cardboard. Likewise, if we do not have the most qualified people, we should train the people we have. If a carpenter knows his trade, he will be able to make tables out of almost any material. We need to be like this in the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<h2 class=head1>BEARING THE TESTIMONY</h2><p>We have seen that the Levites between the ages of thirty and fifty were the ones who bore the testimony. They were qualified both in age and in training. To bear the testimony is to have the actual church life. Neither the fighting on the frontier nor the taking care of the young ones is the direct service of the testimony, the direct church life. However, in order to keep the church life, we need both the fighting and the caring for the little ones. Those fighting on the frontier keep the enemy away, and the little ones, forming a wall around the tabernacle, maintain the testimony. But those typified by the Levites between the ages of thirty and fifty carry on the direct church life. With them are a number of learners. A great many people are needed for the Lord&#8217;s testimony, all of whom are for the tabernacle either directly or indirectly. Presently we are seriously lacking those who know how to care for the tabernacle in a fine way in order to carry the Lord&#8217;s testimony. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we need a group of experienced ones who have been trained to bear the testimony.<p>We are not here as part of Christianity; neither are we here to be another denomination or independent group. We are the Lord&#8217;s recovery. For this, we must be serious with the Lord and go on with Him according to our age. Then a strong testimony will be built up. There will be a clear testimony to the Christians, to the unbelievers, and to the principalities and powers in the air. We shall be able to testify to all that the Lord has fulfilled His prophecy in Matthew 16:18 concerning the building of the church. The clear picture of the type in the Old Testament helps us to see what we need today.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE YOUNG PEOPLE FIGHTING THE BATTLE, THE NEW ONES KEEPING THE TABERNACLE, AND THE OLDER ONES CARING DIRECTLY FOR THE TENT OF MEETING</h1><p>We have seen that in the Lord&#8217;s move on earth, there are two areas of function: fighting the battle and keeping the testimony. For fighting the battle the Israelites between the ages of twenty and thirty were useful, but for keeping the testimony the older ones, those above the age of thirty, were necessary. According to the picture in the Old Testament, those in the middle-aged group are the ones most necessary for the Lord&#8217;s move.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR A PEACEFUL REALM</h2><p>Chapters one and two of the book of Numbers reveal that the children of Israel were formed into an army because they were surrounded by enemies. This army was necessary for the protection of God&#8217;s testimony. Around the church as God&#8217;s testimony today, there are many enemies. Because we are an anti-testimony, there are many enemies to the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Hence, there is the need of an army to protect the testimony. We have seen that this army does not take care of the tent of meeting directly. Rather, according to the picture in Numbers, the army was encamped around the tabernacle to protect the sphere, the realm, in which the tabernacle was erected. For the keeping of the tent of meeting, there was the need for a peaceful sphere. Because the twelve tribes camped around the tent of meeting, wherever the children of Israel went, there was a peaceful realm in which the tabernacle could be erected. Today in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we need the young people to be an army encamped around the church life.<h2 class=head1>KEEPING THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>The twelve tribes of the children of Israel not only fought the enemy, but also gained the ground to create a peaceful realm for the setting up of the tabernacle. This ground made it possible for God&#8217;s habitation to be safely erected. Today we need the young people to drive away the enemy and to gain more young people to secure the safety of the Lord&#8217;s testimony. In every major city there is the need for a peaceful sphere for the establishment of the church life. The gaining of such a sphere is the responsibility of the young people.<p>By studying the picture presented in the book of Numbers, we can see what the responsibility of the middle-aged brothers and sisters should be. In chapter three of Numbers we see how to keep the tent of meeting. Those related to the tent of meeting were in three sections according to their age: one section for those from one month to twenty years; a second section for those between twenty and thirty; and a third section for those over the age of thirty. We have seen that those between the ages of twenty and thirty were to fight the battle and that those over thirty were to maintain the testimony directly. But what about those between the ages of one month and twenty years? Those in this age group surrounded the tabernacle in order to keep it. The Bible does not tell us the meaning of keeping the tabernacle. Perhaps it meant to protect the tabernacle and to share in its maintenance. As the Lord&#8217;s testimony today, the church needs more young ones, more new ones. However, most of us in the church life do not have the way to use the new ones. It seems that the more new ones we have, the more trouble we have. But the more young ones there are, the more the church is protected. How wonderful it would be if the church in Anaheim  had a thousand new ones to protect the church life!<p>In the meetings of the church many times the same ones give testimonies again and again. I am eager to hear new ones speaking in the meetings. If many new ones would testify at the Lord&#8217;s table meeting, I would be excited. Some of those who speak often are quite eloquent. But eloquence means nothing. The church is not a place for eloquent speaking. Instead of eloquence, I prefer to hear the childlike speech of the new ones. How sweet such speaking is! We do not want to hear the same voices all the time. If there are no new ones speaking in the meetings, the church life will be under attack. A sister may be sixty years old as far as physical age is concerned, but spiritually, having been newly converted, she may be only a month old. To hear such a one praise the Lord is very sweet. Although her speech may not be eloquent, it is refreshing and encouraging. How refreshed we would be if several newly converted ones would stand up in the meeting and praise the Lord for their salvation! We need the speaking of such babes and young ones. We need more new converts to guard the Lord&#8217;s testimony. We need a line of spiritual babes and young ones to surround the church life.<h2 class=head1>CARING FOR NEW ONES, NOT FOR LEADERSHIP</h2><p>Numbers 3:32 says, &#8220;And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.&#8221; This verse indicates that Eleazar was to have the oversight of all those between the ages of one month and twenty years. I hope that among the elders in the churches some will be overseers of the babes or teen-agers.<p>We should forget about being leaders. For many years I have been looking to the Lord for a way to have the church life without the eldership being so prominent. I have also been seeking a way to have the church service without emphasizing leadership. Although there is a need for elders, eldership has been a strong temptation for many brothers. In the past certain brothers have been ambitious to be elders. Once I received a telephone call from a brother who asked me whether or not he would be an elder in the locality to which he was migrating. I told him that migration is not for eldership. Anyone who moves to a city expecting to be an elder is not qualified for eldership. Others desire to be leaders in the service groups. Many who have had such an expectation have been disappointed when they were not appointed elders or service group leaders. My point here is that we need to drop our natural concept of &#8220;leadership.&#8221; However, we need many brothers and sisters to take up the burden to care for the young ones and the new ones. Do not wait for the elders to arrange something. Be encouraged to carry out your burden for the new ones.<h2 class=head1>CARING FOR CHRIST IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS</h2><p>The most important age group with respect to the tabernacle was the group between the ages of thirty and fifty. The burden of caring for the tent of meeting was directly upon them. It was those in this age group who carried the various parts of the tabernacle from place to place. In the church life we need those between twenty and thirty to fight the battle, those from one month to twenty to guard the tent of meeting, and those over thirty to care directly for the tent of meeting. According to the book of Numbers, those thirty and over carried the ark, the show bread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, the brass altar, and all the vessels and utensils. The children of Kohath took care of the vessels; the children of Gershon, the curtains, hangings, and coverings; and the children of Merari, the pillars, the boards, and sockets. We may apply these types to today&#8217;s church life. We need many saints experienced in Christ to take care of different aspects of Christ for the constitution of the church life. We need a number of experienced saints to take care of Christ as the ark, as the incense altar, as the showbread table, as the lampstand, and as the brass altar. Those who have experienced Christ in these ways should convey these aspects of Christ to the new ones. Many are short of the experience of Christ as the ark or as the incense altar. Thus, there is the need of the experienced ones to carry Christ to them in these ways.<p>The ark was not carried within the tent of meeting. Likewise, we do not need to carry Christ as the ark to the new ones only in the meetings. There is much opportunity to do this outside the meetings. For this reason, we have some evenings each week for the basic church meetings, meetings for prayer, the Lord&#8217;s table, and Bible study; one evening for our family life; and the other evenings open to have fellowship with saints, especially to care for the new ones or for the young ones. We need to use this time to minister Christ to others as the ark, the table of showbread, or as the lampstand. This is what it means to care for the vessels that belong to the tent of meeting.<h2 class=head1>THE LIBERTY TO CARRY OUT OUR BURDEN</h2><p>In the past the elders have been too exercised in making arrangements and in selecting saints to do things. Instead of this, we should give the saints the liberty to carry out their burden and encourage them to do so. Not long ago I proposed to the elders that many homes be opened for Bible studies. Although a number are burdened for this, they are waiting for the elders to arrange something. Do not wait for the elders to make arrangements or to decide who is qualified to have a Bible study in his home. We all can study the Bible. Can you not gather a few of your neighbors together for a Bible study on the Gospel of John? Certainly you can. Whether or not you can carry on a Bible study does not depend on eloquence; it depends upon your burden. People do not want eloquence-they want reality. I encourage you, according to your burden, to have a living, informal Bible study according to the spirit. This is simply one example of the many things the saints are able to do.<p>Since coming into the church life, we have heard message after message. The saints not only need to eat the spiritual food; they need to work and to be useful. All the brothers and sisters can be useful and do something. I would encourage the elders to stop making arrangements and to let the saints be busy. In the church I like to see that the saints are busy and that the elders have much time to pray. Although the saints should not wait for the elders to make arrangements, they should not be rebellious or independent in what they do.<p>The church needs the elders, but the elders should not do everything, for this will produce the clergy-laity system. We need the eldership, but not the clergy. As long as the saints are not rebellious or independent and as long as they are for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, whatever they do is all right. They need to be given their freedom. Selection always forms a class among the saints, and this causes division. The elders should give the saints the liberty to drive the &#8220;car.&#8221; As long as they are moving toward the same goal, it does not matter if they drive differently.<h2 class=head1>MINISTERING CHRIST</h2><p>We have pointed out that we need some experienced ones to minister Christ in specific ways to the new ones. Suppose a certain brother, skilled at carpentry, serves with the maintenance group. Although many things in our meeting hall require maintenance, our goal is not merely to take care of the practical needs, but to bear Christ as the ark to those serving in the maintenance group. A new one with ability in carpentry may spontaneously share in this service. The more experienced ones should be thankful for this new one, not for the help that he can render in maintenance, but for the opportunity to minister Christ into him as the ark. This is shepherding. If those in the maintenance service minister Christ to others in this way, this service will be full of Christ.<p>However, this is not yet the situation among us in the church service. Instead of ministering Christ to others, we care for the group itself and, for the sake of the group, we often make a selection among the saints. Do not think that ministering Christ is solely the responsibility of the elders. It is the responsibility of all the saints. There are innumerable opportunities to minister Christ. If there were thousands of us ministering Christ, we still could not exhaust the opportunities.<h2 class=head1>SERVING THE LORD IN THE SPIRIT</h2><p>With respect to the tabernacle, Moses and Aaron did not do very much. They did not do the packing nor the carrying. The elders in the churches today, on the contrary, do too much. The elders should not promote organization. Organization leads to hierarchy, which in turn issues in the clergy-laity system. There is a strong tendency, even among us, to have the laity. But if we have the laity, then we have the clergy also. The church needs the elders, not to control the saints nor to do everything for them, but to fulfill their own duty. The elders should decide the time of the meetings, and they should represent the church in certain matters. Instead of waiting for the elders to make arrangements, the saints should pray and function according to the spirit. However, there must be no tendency to independence or rebellion. If we are either independent or rebellious, then we are not concerned for the Lord&#8217;s recovery.<p>We need to carry out the Lord&#8217;s recovery according to the heavenly vision. Under the light of this vision, we care for a living testimony in oneness. Nevertheless, in this oneness there is great variety. The saints are free to set up a Bible study in their homes or to engage in other spiritual activities to care for others. They do not need to wait for the elders&#8217; approval or permission. The elders have no right to grant this permission. Every saint has the freedom to serve the Lord in the spirit as long as he is neither independent nor rebellious. This is the way to build up the church.<h2 class=head1>ALL AGES NEEDED</h2><p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we need all ages. The young people need to be released to fight the battle and to gain ground for the recovery. Although they need to be released, they should not have a spirit of rebellion. If there is the proper release among the young people, there will be a spiritual explosion among us. This involves risks, but without taking risks nothing can be accomplished. If Columbus had not been willing to take a risk, he never would have discovered this continent.<p>In Anaheim we have had too much organization and selection. We need to turn from this. We are not qualified to determine who is good or not so good. Our maneuvering can accomplish nothing for the Lord. Only the Lord knows who is trustworthy and faithful. Without His mercy, none of us can be trustworthy. Whenever I see organization or selection in the church life, my heart aches. From now on, let us drop organization and selection. All the saints are useful in the various sections of the church life. The young people are good for fighting, the new ones are good for keeping the tabernacle, and the older ones are good for taking direct care of the tent of meeting. Let us do everything we can for the Lord in the spirit, but without a trace of independence or rebellion. Furthermore, we do not need to be unified nor controlled by the eldership. All the brothers and sisters must move ahead to do their duty and to fulfill their responsibility.<h2 class=head1>NO SPECIAL SERVICE</h2><p>In the church life, we should not make anything special. Rather, we should be general. For example, some time ago there was the need to set up a business office for the church in Anaheim. In order to have a business office, there is the need to have brothers and sisters to serve in the office. Some, regarding this as a special service, were disappointed when they were not invited to serve in the business office. Others felt quite proud at being asked to serve. If you serve in the business office, you should not feel proud about it. Rather, you should regard yourself as a slave. If you consider it a glory to be chosen to serve in the business office, perhaps you need to resign, for you are not caring for the tabernacle in a proper way. We need to tear down the concept of prestige in the church life. More than fifty years ago, we were raised up by the Lord to tear down these things. Let us not build them up again. We should not be concerned about being in a so-called special service; rather, we should be concerned about taking care of others.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST MANIFESTED</h2><p>The children of Gershon carried the curtains and the four layers of covering for the tabernacle. These refer to different aspects of Christ. We need to experience Christ in certain specific aspects and then help others to also have these experiences of Him. If we do this, we are here as the Lord&#8217;s testimony, not as part of religion. For the sake of having a living testimony, we need many who know Christ in a rich way and in many aspects. For example, some should know Christ as the badgers&#8217; skins and as the textiles in the tabernacle. If we know Christ in a full way, He will be richly manifested among us. This is the church life. What a shame it is to have organization, selection, arrangements, and assignments without the experience of Christ! To do this is to repeat the history of Christianity. We all need to stand against such a trend. We need to have Christ manifested among us in many different aspects. Then we need to come together and express Christ in the church meetings and to minister Him to others.<p>The family of Merari carried the pillars, the boards, and the sockets. In other words, they bore the solid elements of the tent of meeting. This signifies that some among us need to experience Christ as the sockets that are weighty and full of Christ and as the boards that form the solid structure of the tabernacle. Those who have experienced Christ in this way need to help others out of their experience. If this is our practice in the church life, then at the Lord&#8217;s table meeting many new ones will give testimonies full of reality. This is the proper church life. Such a church life, God&#8217;s testimony on earth, is God&#8217;s habitation. As we bear this kind of testimony, the young people should be on the frontier fighting the enemy and gaining ground, and the new ones should be keeping the tabernacle. May we have all three sections in the church life.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>MAINTAINING THE TESTIMONY OF THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH IN CHRIST</h1><p>The Lord&#8217;s recovery is not primarily a matter of doctrine. In the recovery today we are concerned for the experience of Christ and for the practice of the proper church life.<h2 class=head1>DIVISIONS OVER DOCTRINE</h2><p>Martin Luther took the way of the state church. In this he made a mistake. It is a serious mistake for the government and the church to be mixed together. Approximately two hundred years after the Reformation, the Lord began the recovery of the church life under Zinzendorf and the Moravian brothers. In the following century, the Lord raised up the brothers in Great Britain for the further practice of the church life. At first, their experience was wonderful, and Brother Nee even considered it the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning the church in Philadelphia. However, eventually there was a division, mainly because different opinions regarding the Lord&#8217;s coming were held by two outstanding Brethren teachers, John Nelson Darby and Benjamin Newton. If Darby and Newton had had the light concerning oneness, they would not have argued about the Lord&#8217;s coming, but would have maintained the oneness of the church. The division between Darby and Newton was followed by many other divisions. I know of a Brethren assembly that was divided over the use of a musical instrument.<p>Today Christians are divided over many things, for example, over the method of baptism or over baptizing people in the name of Jesus or in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Because there has been so much division caused by debates over doctrine, we need to emphasize the fact that the primary concern in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today is not doctrine. This does not mean, however, that we do not study the Bible. We study the Bible and know it very well. But our primary concern is the recovery of Christ as life and of the church as our living. We are for the recovery of Christ and the church, not for the recovery of doctrines regarding head covering, foot washing, or the method of immersion. If anyone still wants to dissent regarding doctrine, the church in the Lord&#8217;s recovery is not the place for him. He should meet with those whose doctrine he finds acceptable.<h2 class=head1>LIVING BY CHRIST AND EXPRESSING HIM IN ONENESS</h2><p>We are here as the Lord&#8217;s recovery, not as part of today&#8217;s Christianity. The church is the redeemed, saved, forgiven, and regenerated people who have Christ as their life and who come together to express Christ in oneness. This is according to God&#8217;s economy for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. Throughout the centuries, the church has become degraded. Therefore, the Lord has raised up a testimony at the end of this age to recover the proper church life. In the church life we live by Christ as our life and come together in oneness to express Him.<p>The Lord does not require the believers to be uniform in doctrine. Chapter fourteen of Romans proves this strongly. Concerning eating and the keeping of days, Paul&#8217;s attitude in this chapter was liberal. In verse 6 Paul said, &#8220;He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God.&#8221; In these matters the saints were not to judge one another. On the contrary, they were to receive one another. Verse 3 says, &#8220;Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him.&#8221; Regarding the receiving of believers, Paul said, &#8220;Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God&#8221; (Rom. 15:7). God receives the believers no matter what they eat, and we also should receive them. The same is true with respect to the keeping of certain days. We should receive one another, not criticize one another or debate with one another. We all need to have a gracious and liberal attitude.<p>Suppose someone criticizes the church meetings for being too noisy and claims that noisy meetings are contrary to the verse in 1 Corinthians 14 which tells us to do all things decently and in order. One who holds such an opinion should go to a place he regards as decent and orderly. If we impose our views upon others, we shall cause division. If you speak in tongues, you should not insist that others do so. Such a demand will cause division.<p>In Romans 15:5 Paul exhorts us &#8220;to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.&#8221; We cannot be likeminded in doctrine; we can be likeminded only according to Christ. Apart from Christ, believers from different cultures and with different dispositions cannot be likeminded. A brother may not even be likeminded with his wife. Although we may not be likeminded concerning so many things, we can be likeminded concerning Christ and the church. We are one in Christ, and we are one for the church. The Lord can testify that my wife and I do not have different opinions regarding Christ and the church.<h2 class=head1>PROPHETS, TEACHERS, AND EXHORTERS</h2><p>Acts 2:14 says that Peter stood up with the eleven. The &#8220;eleven&#8221; here refers to the apostles. At the time of Acts 2, the gifted persons were the apostles. There were no prophets or teachers. But Acts 13:1 says that in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers, also gifted persons. In contrast to the kingship and the priesthood, which were particular ministries, the prophethood is not a separate ministry, but a supplementary ministry. When King David fell into sin, the prophet Nathan rebuked him. But if David had not sinned, there would not have been a need for Nathan to speak a word of rebuke. This indicates that if the kings had always been proper, there would have been no need for the prophets. The prophets were raised up when the priesthood and the kingship were weak.<p>In the time of the Old Testament recovery, Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the governor, a descendant of David, are mentioned. Their ministries were used by the Lord in His recovery. But when they became weak and the work of recovery ceased, the Lord raised up the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to strengthen them. This indicates that the prophethood is not a separate, independent ministry. Rather, it functions to support the ministry of the kingship and the priesthood.<p>Romans 12 speaks of the functions of prophets, teachers, and exhorters. What is the difference between prophesying, teaching, and exhorting? The main function of a prophet is not predicting the future; rather, a prophet speaks for God as His spokesman. God&#8217;s prophets in the Bible were sent by God to speak for Him. Although they sometimes spoke concerning the future, most of the time they uttered words of rebuke, declaration, or condemnation. What the prophets speak they do not learn from man, but receive directly from God. The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel did not repeat the teachings of others; they spoke what was revealed to them directly by God. They spoke what they saw in God&#8217;s vision, God&#8217;s revelation. In contrast to the prophets, teachers do not have direct revelation. Instead, they teach according to what the prophets have spoken. In order to be a teacher, one must know what has been spoken by the prophets. An exhorter uses the teaching of the teachers to exhort others. For this reason, Romans 12 mentions the prophets first, then the teachers, and then the exhorters. The prophets receive the direct revelation, the teachers instruct others according to the revelation given to the prophets, and the exhorters do the exhorting according to this teaching.<p>Now we need to apply this to the situation in the church life today. We have pointed out that the middle-aged brothers and sisters are the ones most needed for the church life. Those in this age group care for the tent of meeting directly, whereas the young people are useful for fighting the battle, and the new ones, for guarding the tabernacle. Therefore, the testimony of the church today depends directly on the middle-aged ones. In order for the middle-aged ones to function normally, they need to set aside the ambition for leadership or eldership. Elders are necessary in the church, but their function is not all that is needed. There is also the need for prophets, teachers, and exhorters. In Anaheim there is a great need for the saints to be established and confirmed by those who teach and exhort. Many young ones need someone to teach them by feeding them through fellowship.<p>In the church the need for elders is limited. If all the brothers are seeking the eldership, they will find a &#8220;no vacancy&#8221; sign in front of the eldership &#8220;motel.&#8221; Do not waste your time waiting for a vacancy in this motel. Instead, go to the motel of teaching and exhortation where there are many vacancies.<h2 class=head1>OPENING OUR HOMES</h2><p>I am burdened that the saints in Anaheim open up their homes for the preaching of the gospel or for fellowship with the saints. There is no need for the elders to arrange this. Families in the same neighborhood may come together to pray and seek the Lord&#8217;s leading. The Lord may lead some families to hold an informal gospel meeting in one of the homes. Others may be led to invite their unsaved neighbors to a home for a time of refreshments. In doing this, we should not try to proselytize others. Rather, we should minister salvation to the unsaved ones and minister Christ to the believers. If we minister the riches of Christ to others, they will be stirred up to seek the Lord. It is the Lord who adds to the church. Our intention is not to proselytize; it is to minister Christ as life to others and to give them a testimony of our salvation, of our love for the Lord, and of our oneness. We are here to be a collective living testimony of those who live by Christ and for Christ.<p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery there surely is the need for elders to care for the administration of the church and to make decisions regarding such practical matters as the times of the meetings. But not every brother in a local church can be an elder. Other functions, including teaching and exhorting, are urgently needed for the building up of the church. We need to preach the gospel to sinners, and we need to share the Lord&#8217;s testimony with Christians. The elders alone cannot do this. All the saints need to take up the burden for preaching the gospel, for spreading the Lord&#8217;s testimony, and for edifying the saints through fellowship. If we do this, the church will grow, and the recovery will spread.<p>Because many different functions are needed, let us set aside the thought of leadership. Whether or not you are a leader is unimportant. The important matter is that you are willing to preach the gospel, to care for other Christians, or to edify the saints.<h2 class=head1>NO DIVISION, INDEPENDENCE, OR REBELLION</h2><p>As those in the Lord&#8217;s recovery, our spirit and our motive must be pure, and we must do everything possible to avoid division. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is a matter of Christ and the church in oneness. If we are divisive, then we are not for the recovery. Furthermore, we should not act independently of the church. Although there is no need to gain the permission of the elders to function by opening your home, do not be individualistic in doing this. Furthermore, do not be rebellious, for rebellion kills our purpose. There is no room for rebellion in the church. The saints should respect the elders as the leading ones in the church and have fellowship with them. The elders should not control the saints, but the saints should be willing to fellowship with the elders. However, we should not make fellowship a matter of legality.<h2 class=head1>NOT TEACHING DIFFERENTLY</h2><p>We have seen that the believers need not be the same in doctrine. However, in 1 Timothy 1:3 Paul indicates that we should not teach differently. This means that we should not teach our particular doctrine. We are not for our doctrine, but for the oneness of the church in Christ. Dozens of homes may be opened for the preaching of the gospel or for fellowship, but in these home meetings we should all teach the same things. Do not use a gathering in your home as an opportunity to teach your particular doctrine. Do not teach foot-washing, head covering, or a certain view of the rapture, but teach concerning Christ and the church.<h2 class=head1>NOT INSISTING ON OUR WAY</h2><p>Moreover, we should not have the attitude that our way is the way. Also, we should not try to be particular. Whatever you do, do not label it as something special. This causes division. In 1 Corinthians 1:10 Paul exhorted the Corinthians to be perfectly attuned in one mind and in one opinion. Do not have the attitude that everyone in the church should take your way, and do not insist upon any certain way. For example, there are many ways to drive from Anaheim to Los Angeles. Although some ways are better than others, those who take a better way should not insist that everyone do the same. Likewise, in the church life we should not say that we have the way to be spiritual, to be one, or to be built up.<h2 class=head1>LOVING OTHERS</h2><p>In addition to all the matters we have already covered, we also need to point out the importance of loving others. We need to love all people, especially all those who confess the name of the Lord Jesus. If we do not love all believers, we are narrow and sectarian. We should love not only those who are lovable, but especially the ones who are not lovable. In Matthew 5:46 the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;If you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not also the tax collectors do the same?&#8221; In the church life we should give more honor to the uncomely members. According to 1 Corinthians 12, the uncomely parts are more necessary. As a living testimony of Jesus and as an anti-testimony to this age, we are here, not as part of today&#8217;s Christianity, but for Christ and the church. For this, we need to love one another.<h2 class=head1>NEVER FORMING A PARTY</h2><p>In the church life we should never form a party. Whether the formation of a party is intentional or not, the existence of a party in the church life is always damaging. Throughout the years, I have not had a special intimacy with anyone. Such intimacy is typified in the Old Testament by honey, which eventually becomes leaven. A personal intimacy is something of the natural life. Therefore, do not form intimate relationships according to your natural choice. The sisters especially must take heed to this warning, for, because they are emotional, it is easy for them to have &#8220;honey&#8221; in their relationships with one another. Sisters, do not spend so much time with those who match your personal taste; rather, have fellowship with those who differ from your natural choice. If we are for the Lord&#8217;s testimony, we shall have nothing to do with any party.<p>If we practice all the points covered in this chapter, the church will grow and be built up, and the Lord&#8217;s recovery will spread. Then the church life will be a living testimony. In activities we may be different, but in our speaking of Christ and the church we are one, not because the elders endeavor to make us one, but because we are for the testimony of the oneness of the church in Christ. A strong testimony of Christ and the church will defeat the enemy and pave the way for the Lord Jesus to come back. The Lord needs such a strong and living testimony today. This depends upon us all. May we not fail Him!<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>SHEPHERDING THE SAINTS</h1><p>We have seen that in the church life there is the need not only for elders, but also for prophets, teachers, and exhorters. Our problem today is that the eldership occupies too great a place in our concept. Brothers who love the Lord and have the ability to do something for the church have the subconscious desire to be elders. Nothing has bothered me more through the years than to see in so many brothers this hidden expectation to be elders. Yes, in 1 Timothy 3:1 Paul does say that he who desires to be an elder, an overseer, desires a good work. But the motive must be pure, wholly for the Lord&#8217;s interest and without personal ambition. However, some of the brothers who want to be elders are motivated by ambition. For this reason, I have the burden to point out that there is much more to the church life than eldership. In the &#8220;hotel&#8221; of the church life in the Lord&#8217;s recovery there is not only the &#8220;room&#8221; of eldership but also that of prophesying, teaching, and exhorting. Nevertheless, many brothers endeavor to get into the room called &#8220;eldership,&#8221; and many sisters want to enter the room called &#8220;leading sisters.&#8221; But we have no such thing as leading sisters. I do not even like to hear this term used. We all need to forget about position and title. The New Testament reveals that besides eldership there are many other functions the saints can fulfill according to their burden.<h2 class=head1>A TESTIMONY AND AN EXAMPLE</h2><p>I thank the Lord for the testimony and example of brother Eugene Gruhler, Sr. Although he was neither an elder nor a leader among us, he did a great deal of shepherding. He functioned in this way until the very hour the Lord took him to Himself. During the years he was with us, he invited a great many brothers and sisters into his home. Everyone who spent time with him was strengthened and edified. This is what the church needs today. Although Brother Gruhler never sat in the front row, he was always watchful for new ones and invited them to his home for a meal at the first opportunity. The church needs such shepherds today.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICAL SPIRITUALITY</h2><p>In Shanghai the more experienced sisters were exercised to take care of others during the meetings. Realizing that many needed to be warmed and comforted, they purposely sat next to new ones or weak ones in order to help them. If you sit next to a weaker one in the meeting, that one will be greatly helped.<p>In the church life we need &#8220;mothers&#8221; and &#8220;fathers&#8221; to take care of the spiritual children. The church needs shepherding; it does not need brothers and sisters to come together in special groups according to their preference. It is not normal for &#8220;mothers&#8221; to abandon their spiritual children and spend all their time together. That is not the proper family life. Although the &#8220;mothers&#8221; may come together at certain times, they should spend more time in caring for the new ones, the young ones, and the weak ones. We need a practical spirituality, not a spirituality in word. If we have such a practical spirituality, we shall care for those who are not coming to the church meetings.<p>Certain ones among us claim that they have seen the Body. Time will prove whether or not they have actually seen the Body. However, we should not make such a claim nor have any confidence in such claims. You may say that you have seen the Body, but you may not have anything practical. If you have truly seen the Body, you will be concerned for the weaker ones.<h2 class=head1>NO RANK OR SPECIAL CLASS</h2><p>In the church life we need to take care of the little ones, the weaker ones, and the uncomely ones. We must not have any rank; the strong ones should not form into a special class of their own. If the elders are always conscious of the fact that they are elders, they should resign. The elders should regard themselves as little brothers. This is the reason we never use the term &#8220;elder&#8221; as a title or speak of Elder So-and-so. In like manner, we should not have the concept of so-called leading sisters. Yes, we have leading ones both in reality and in practicality, but we should not have titles or the consciousness of position. What a shame it is to seek for position or title in the church life out of ambition!<h2 class=head1>NO PRIVATE INTIMACY</h2><p>At this point I need to say a strong word: never have a private intimacy with anyone in the church life. No matter how spiritual we may be, we are still in the flesh and influenced by the flesh. If we are truly for the Lord&#8217;s recovery, we must crucify the flesh and never allow it to form a private intimacy. I can testify that I do not have a personal intimacy with anyone. Although I share in responsibility with certain brothers, I rarely go to their homes, and they rarely come to mine. Instead of private friendship or personal intimacy, there should simply be the fact that we are members of the Body.<h2 class=head1>MINISTERING LIFE AND SHEPHERDING</h2><p>Genuine spirituality is seen in ministering Christ as life to others. A proverb says that if we water others, we shall be watered also (Prov. 11:25). The spirituality in the church life is not a matter of being in a certain select group; it is a matter of ministering life.<p>Again I say that there is a great need for shepherding. Do not expect that everyone in the church life will be a spiritual giant. On the contrary, the proper church life is a big family that includes grandparents, young ones, weak ones, and even sick ones. When all the saints are cared for, we shall have a beautiful church life. Please forget about eldership and leadership and take care of the practical needs of the church. I hope that many will have the heart to care for those who are discouraged and not in the meetings. At the very least, call them on the telephone and tell them that you miss them and hope to see them soon. Even such shepherding will help to keep them in the church life. If we love the church, let us change our concept regarding leadership and take care of the members of the Body. If we all do this, what a glorious church life we shall have!<h2 class=head1>THE FUNCTION OF ELDERS</h2><p>Let us now consider the function of the elders. Acts 14:23 says that the Apostle Paul and his co-workers appointed elders in every church, and in Acts 20:28 Paul speaks of the elders of the church in Ephesus as overseers. The Greek words for elder and bishop, or overseer, are presbyteros and episkopos respectively. Titles for two types of denominational organizations-Presbyterian and Episcopalian-are taken from these Greek words. According to the Bible, the elders and the overseers are the same people. Their responsibility is to exercise oversight; it is not to do all the practical things. For example, an elder should not spend the whole day sweeping the meeting hall parking lot. Rather, along with possibly doing some cleaning himself, he should exercise the oversight of the cleaning work. Likewise, the elders should oversee the shepherding of the saints to be sure that all are taken care of. This is the right way for the elders to function as overseers.<p>The main responsibility of elders, however, is shepherding. In 1 Peter 5:1 Peter refers to himself as a co-elder (Gk.). Peter was an elder in one locality, whereas some of those addressed in his Epistle were elders in other localities. The term &#8220;co-elder&#8221; is very meaningful. It implies that although the elders are in different localities, they should work together with one another as co-elders. We are shepherding one flock, not many flocks, because the Lord Jesus has just one flock. Part of this flock is in Anaheim, another part is in Los Angeles, and still another part is in San Diego. The elders in all the churches are the co-elders, and the Lord Jesus is the head Shepherd. Shepherding is the main function of the elders.<h2 class=head1>APT TO TEACH</h2><p>In order to shepherd the saints, the elders must be apt to teach. In shepherding others by teaching, we do not give them lectures or messages. Rather, we give them edifying and nourishing instructions. We may not be eloquent, but we can still nourish others by instructing them.<p>According to Ephesians 4, the shepherds and the teachers are one category. This indicates that anyone who would be a shepherd must also be a teacher. Likewise, a good teacher is also a shepherd. Some so-called teachers, however, do not know anything about shepherding. They may give sermons, but they do not shepherd anyone. But in the Bible a shepherd is a teacher, and a teacher is a shepherd. Just as a mother shepherds her children by feeding them and caring for them, so we also need to shepherd God&#8217;s children. For example, some need help in knowing the church ground. In order for them to be clear about the ground of the church, someone needs to shepherd them by teaching them. Who will do this work? We all must rise up to do it. No matter how many elders we may have, they are not sufficient to fill the gap. For the shepherding, there is the need for all the brothers and sisters to function.<p>We teach others by what we do. Suppose a new one sitting next to you in a meeting cannot find the book of Haggai. By helping him find this book, you teach him. Perhaps someone else is not familiar with a certain term that is used. By having fellowship with him, you may help him understand the significance of this term. This is shepherding. All the weak ones, new ones, and young ones need a great deal of such teaching. Whenever someone renders them this kind of help, they are built up. Eventually, through receiving this kind of help, they also become useful. This is the way to build up the church.<p>In the previous chapters I encouraged the saints to open their homes. Now I encourage you all to do the shepherding. Sisters, some of you have been in the Lord and in the church life for years, and you have attended many conferences and trainings. Surely you have received something from the Lord. Now is the time to exercise yourselves to use the grace you have received and the gift you have been given to care for others.<p>The way to grow is not by grouping yourselves together in a selective way; it is by eating and working. My health comes from these two sources. I eat well, and I work with every fiber of my being. After I work, I rest. The more I work, the better I rest. Sisters, I encourage you to go to the weaker ones. If you do this, the church meetings will be full of joy and glory. Oh, so many sick ones, hurt ones, and young ones need to be taken care of! How can we come together and praise the Lord for our oneness if we are not willing to shepherd the saints? Whenever I hear this kind of praise, I wonder about the weak ones and the young ones and about those who do not come to the meetings. I wonder who is taking care of them. There is no need to tell me how much oneness you have. If you go to the weaker ones and shepherd them, then your oneness is genuine and practical. I thank the Lord that you all are for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. But we still need to be for the recovery in a practical way.<h2 class=head1>BRINGING BACK THE LOST SHEEP</h2><p>I hope that in the coming days many lost sheep will be brought back. I can still remember my mother&#8217;s concern for her seven children. Whenever one of the children was out too late, my mother would tell me that I should have no peace or rest until that one was home. She told me that if I were not willing to go out after my brothers and sisters, I did not truly love them. Therefore, I had to go to look for the brother or sister who was not at home. My mother would not accept any excuse. In the same principle, how can we be at rest until our brothers and sisters have been brought back to the church life? You may be at rest, but I am not at rest, for I am concerned for those who are not with us.<h2 class=head1>TAKING THE LEAD</h2><p>In 1 Timothy 5:17 Paul speaks of those who take the lead well. This is to take the lead as a shepherd leads a flock. In the church life there is some need for administration, for example, to make decisions concerning the times and days of the meetings and for other practical arrangements. For this, there is the need for elders who do a good job at taking the lead. Once the elders have taken the lead in a certain matter, perhaps in cleaning the meeting hall, they should step aside and oversee the work of others. This is necessary for the proper church life.<p>First Timothy 5:17 implies that some elders are better at taking the lead and that others are better at teaching. This verse says that the elders who rule well should be &#8220;counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.&#8221; Among the elders, some excel in taking the lead, and others, in teaching.<p>Many of us need to take up the burden to be co-shepherds and co-teachers with the elders. Then the church will bear a strong testimony to the whole universe. If we forget about leadership and concentrate on shepherding, the Lord will honor what we do.<h2 class=head1>ONLY FOR THE LORD&#8217;S RECOVERY</h2><p>We are not here for ourselves, but for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. We do not want to corrupt the recovery by acting according to our natural feeling or natural concept. We want to see the church built up in a pure way. For this, we need the heart to devote our very being to shepherding the saints.<p>I can testify that my heart is solely for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. Only the recovery can make me happy. But anything that damages the recovery grieves me deeply. We all must set a watch against the Devil, the flesh, and the subtle self. Because we can be damaged at any time, we need to be watchful. I expect that you all will remain in the Lord&#8217;s recovery and that we shall see one another in glory in the coming kingdom. In order to be in the Lord&#8217;s glory and in His kingdom, we all must take grace and not repeat the damage caused by Christianity. Because we love Christ and the church, we should take Christ as our practical life and the church life as our practical living. Anything that damages the recovery we must gladly give up. In the Lord&#8217;s recovery we are absolute for Christ and the church.<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE TEMPERING OF THE BODY AND CARING FOR THE SAINTS</h1><p>In this message we shall consider some verses in 1 Corinthians 12. In verse 22 Paul says, &#8220;But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.&#8221; We may think that the stronger ones are needed but that the weaker ones are burdensome. But this verse says that the weaker ones are necessary. They are necessary for the building up of the church. In the local church, therefore, there is the need for the weaker ones.<h2 class=head1>THE TEMPERING OF THE BODY</h2><p>In verse 24 Paul tells us that &#8220;God has tempered the body together.&#8221; For the building up of the Body there is the need for tempering. In order for God to temper the Body, the weaker members are necessary. Paul&#8217;s word here was not only according to the revelation he had received, but also according to his experience. In his experience Paul realized that God needed the weaker members in order to build up the Body of Christ. We may think that if every member of the church in Anaheim were a Peter, a Paul, or a John, the church would be wonderful. Perhaps it would be wonderful, but it would not be tempered. It would not be balanced. The Lord does not want a church that is extreme and unbalanced.<h2 class=head1>BEAUTIFYING THE LESS HONORABLE MEMBERS</h2><p>Continuing verse 22, verse 23 says, &#8220;Those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor; and our uncomely members have more abundant comeliness.&#8221; If we consider that a certain brother or sister is less honorable, then we need to clothe that one with more abundant honor. This means that we need to beautify him by clothing him. All the weaker ones are worthy of our respect because they are needed. Likewise, all the seemingly less honorable ones need to be clothed with more abundant honor. After these members are clothed with honor, they will have more abundant comeliness.<p>With what are we to clothe the apparently less honorable members? We must clothe them with Christ. According to the book of Exodus, the tabernacle had four layers of coverings. These coverings typify Christ. Furthermore, all the textiles related to the tent of meeting are types of Christ in different aspects. In order to clothe others with Christ, we need to experience Him in a rich way as our clothing, covering, and beautification. Then we shall be able to clothe our brothers and sisters with Him.<p>Suppose a certain sister is inclined to argue with her husband. Furthermore, suppose her husband, a brother in the church, has a bad temper. In your eyes this brother and sister may not be very honorable. What should you do with them? Should you give up on them or criticize them? No. If you are faithful to shepherd them, you will clothe them with Christ by ministering Christ to them. It will not help to adjust this sister by teaching her to submit to her husband. In speaking to her about her habit of arguing with her husband, you need to care for Christ. You may say, &#8220;Sister, in our daily life we should not only follow the Lord Jesus, but also live by Him as our life. If you argue with your husband, you are not living by Christ. Our desperate need today is to live by Christ.&#8221; Perhaps such fellowship will stir up that sister to pray that she may live by Christ. In her prayer she may ask the Lord to help her to live by Him in dealing with her husband. Through this kind of shepherding the sister is clothed and beautified with Christ. Christ is ministered to her as her beautifying element. This is what it means to clothe the less honorable ones with the honorable Christ. This should take place continually in the Lord&#8217;s recovery. By being instructed how to take Christ as life and how to live by Him, we shall eventually overcome our habit of arguing or of losing our temper.<h2 class=head1>THE COMELY AND THE UNCOMELY</h2><p>In verse 24 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;Our comely members have no need.&#8221; Those who are comely have no need and therefore do not require any particular care. In a sense, we may forget about them. Both the comely and uncomely ones are necessary. The difference here is that the comely ones have no need because they are already comely. The uncomely ones, on the contrary, need to be clothed with honor in order to have more abundant comeliness.<p>These verses speak of three kinds of members: the weaker ones, the less honorable or uncomely ones, and the comely ones. Which kind are you? Actually, we are not able to say whether we are a weaker one, a less honorable one, or a comely one. We should have no confidence in our estimation. I simply do not know what kind of a member I am. However, I can discern when a particular brother is lacking in honor or comeliness. How can I be at peace as long as my brother has such a lack? I should not be at peace until I clothe him with Christ. If we all practice this, how different the church life would be!<h2 class=head1>THE PROVING OF OUR SPIRITUALITY</h2><p>We have pointed out that in verse 24 Paul speaks of the tempering of the Body. To temper something is to make it balanced by dealing with the extremes. For example, we cannot drink water that is either boiling hot or ice cold. But if hot water is tempered with cold water, the tempered water will be the right temperature for drinking. In the local churches there are many different saints. Some are very spiritual; others are not so spiritual. The spiritual ones need to be tempered with those who are not spiritual. Then the spiritual ones will be spiritual in a proper way. The weaker ones are necessary to test the genuineness of our spirituality. Sisters, if you are truly spiritual and if you have genuinely seen the oneness, I ask you to go to the weaker, less honorable sisters and see what you can do for them. You are so hot, but they are so cold. You are so honorable, but they are very uncomely. Because they are utterly without honor, they need to be beautified by you. If you do this, you will find that both you and they are needed. In the Body there is the need for tempering. Even our spirituality must be tempered. Through this tempering, we shall find out how genuine our spirituality actually is. Our spirituality will be proved by God&#8217;s tempering.<p>Do not expect every saint in the church life to be a spiritual giant. This will never be the situation in the church. According to the Bible, we all must be tempered, the hot ones with the cold ones, and the spiritual ones with those who are not spiritual. In the proper church life there will always be the weaker members, the less honorable members, and the comely members. Nevertheless, because all are being tempered together, these are not three divisions.<h2 class=head1>VIOLATING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY</h2><p>In verse 24 Paul also says that God has given more abundant honor to that member which lacks. Any group within the church that claims to be spiritual will always collapse. I have seen this take place several times and in several places. In my home town of Chefoo a certain group of sisters thought they were today&#8217;s Madame Guyons. They regarded themselves as the most spiritual ones, and they tried to help others to be like them. But their so-called spirituality was abnormal and a damage to the Body.<p>When Brother Nee was ministering on the matter of the Body in Shanghai, he emphasized the importance of seeing the Body. Certain co-workers testified strongly that they had seen the Body. However, none of them became a real help to the Body. Both those sisters in Chefoo and those co- workers in Shanghai violated the principle of the Body.<h2 class=head1>NO GROUPING TOGETHER</h2><p>The healing of diseases or injuries in our physical bodies takes place mainly through nourishment. Suppose a certain part of your body is hurt or diseased. It is not possible to feed only this part of the body. On the contrary, you feed your whole body, and this part of the body will be healed. Do not think that the Body will receive some benefit if you select a few strong members of the Body and bring them together. No, the stronger ones and the weaker ones need to be blended together. God does not put all the weak ones into one group and all the strong ones into another group; instead, He tempers them by blending them. It is wrong for the strong ones to group together.<p>If the strong ones group together, the result will be division. According to verses 24 and 25, God tempers the Body together so that there will be no division in the Body. If the shoulders were to come together, there would be a division in the Body. Although you may have no intention of damaging the Body, you will frustrate the growth of the Body if you group yourselves together as stronger ones or more spiritual ones.<p>Verse 26 says, &#8220;If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if a member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it.&#8221; A suffering member of the Body should not be left alone. Rather, the Body with all the members must bear the suffering along with this member.<p>The Body of Christ is not built up with only spiritual giants. On the contrary, the Body is built up with all the different members-the comely ones, the less honorable ones, and the weaker ones. This does not mean, however, that all the different members are arranged in distinct groups. No, all are blended together so that the Body may be tempered. When we are tempered, the uncomely ones share comeliness with the comely ones, and the weaker ones are nourished and supported by the stronger ones. Then we have the Body.<h2 class=head1>CARING FOR THE SAINTS</h2><p>We should never regard ourselves as spiritual or boast of what we have seen. Those sisters in Chefoo who claimed to be today&#8217;s Madame Guyons were actually not that spiritual. Likewise, the co-workers in Shanghai who claimed to have seen the Body actually did not see very much. Often our estimate of ourselves is not accurate. Because of this, we should not classify ourselves. Whatever we may be, we need to have fellowship with the saints and shepherd them. Do your best to take up the burden of caring for the saints. By caring for others, you will be tested. As you contact the weak ones, you will discover not only where they are, but also where you are. Before contacting them, you may think that you are all right, that you know Christ and the church, and that you are wholly for the Lord&#8217;s recovery. But through your contact with the weaker ones, you may discover that you have no food to feed them, no medicine to heal them, and no clothing to cover them. In other words, you will be exposed and realize that so much of what you have is vanity.<h2 class=head1>ADMONISHING THE DISORDERLY ONES</h2><p>First Thessalonians 5:14 says, &#8220;We entreat you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be longsuffering toward all.&#8221; This verse describes the church life.<p>In the church life the disorderly ones are necessary to prove our patience. Thus, we need to praise the Lord for the disorderly ones. We are told to admonish those who are disorderly. This is very difficult. If you admonish them too severely, they may be stirred up to fight with you. Admonishing the disorderly ones requires a great deal of prayer, experience, and exercise of the spirit. Whenever I have had to admonish the disorderly ones, I have had the sense that I was walking on thin ice over a deep river. It is not a simple matter to have the church life. If we pay no attention to the disorderly ones among us, God will send in even more of them to show us that we cannot ignore them. According to 1 Thessalonians 5:14, we must admonish them. The disorderly ones surely expose where we are.<h2 class=head1>CONSOLING THE LITTLE-SOULED</h2><p>First Thessalonians 5:14 also speaks of the fainthearted or little-souled (Gk.). Because some were born with a small soul, they are easily offended, disappointed, or discouraged. Others, on the contrary, were born with a large soul and can withstand a great deal of ill treatment. Those with a small soul can bear hardly anything. Sooner or later in the church life, you will meet some brothers and sisters who have little souls. If there were not this kind of person in the church, the Bible would not speak of consoling or comforting the little-souled ones. What will you do with them? You cannot neglect them. If you try to avoid them, the Lord will add many more like them. The little-souled ones are needed by the stronger ones.<p>Because the little-souled brothers and sisters cannot withstand hardship, we need to comfort them. We need to speak to them in a very kind way to keep from offending them. If a brother comes to you troubled because his wife is upset, do not say much to him and do not argue with him. Rather, tell him that you will pray for him. Instead of reasoning with the little-souled ones, you should comfort them. Reasoning will only hurt them. Our ability to comfort such a one depends altogether on how much we have experienced of Christ. If you have experienced Christ as the incense altar, you will be able to tell a little-souled brother that today Christ, our High Priest, is interceding for him and his problems. In this way, you minister Christ to him. Do not try to comfort the little-souled with mere human words, but comfort him with the Christ you have experienced in various aspects. When a little-souled one is nourished with Christ, he will be comforted. Let us learn to comfort the little-souled ones with Christ.<h2 class=head1>UPHOLDING THE WEAK</h2><p>In 1 Thessalonians 5:14 Paul also tells us to &#8220;uphold the weak.&#8221; In order to uphold the weak, or the infirm, we need to experience Christ as the boards, the pillars, and the sockets in the tabernacle. Because the weak ones are not steady, they need Christ to be their board, pillar, or socket. Such a Christ will make them strong in standing.<h2 class=head1>LONGSUFFERING WITH ALL</h2><p>Finally, in this verse Paul tells us to be longsuffering with all men. Admonishing the disorderly, comforting the little-souled, and upholding the weak require patience. The disorderly, the little-souled, and the weak exhaust our natural patience. Therefore, to shepherd such saints we need Christ as our patience.<h2 class=head1>INCITING, EXHORTING, AND RESTORING</h2><p>Hebrews 10:24 says, &#8220;Let us consider one another for inciting to love and good works.&#8221; According to this verse, we should consider not only ourselves, but one another. Consider those who are discouraged and not coming to the meetings. If you consider them by visiting them or by at least calling them on the telephone, you will incite them to love and good works. Such inciting will increase the mutual love among us.<p>Hebrews 10:25 says, &#8220;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.&#8221; This verse indicates that none of us should form the habit of staying away from the meetings. Rather, as we see the day approaching, we need to exhort one another.<p>Galatians 6:1 says that if someone is overtaken in a fault, we need to restore him with our spirit. This type of shepherding should be done not only by the elders, but by all the saints. If we all do this, the church will grow.<p>The middle-aged ones care for the church as the Lord&#8217;s testimony directly. By shepherding, fellowshipping, teaching, comforting, and upholding others, they will bear the burden for the Lord&#8217;s recovery today.</body></html>
