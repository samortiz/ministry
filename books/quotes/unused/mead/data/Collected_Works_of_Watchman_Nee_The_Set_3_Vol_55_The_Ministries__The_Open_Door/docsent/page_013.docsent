   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Present Condition of the Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Presently, the meetings are much purer than before.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although the number is smaller, all have come for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All who attend the Lord's table meeting are brothers and sisters who were baptized among us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I feel that I will allow the brothers to touch the affairs of the church only after they have been brought through the narrow gate of purging the leaven, and consecration to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our expenses for March were thirteen million yuan the principal expense being payment on three months' rent for a brother .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although this is not a great amount, several brothers have given their all.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Pao-sheng</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>April 22, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mailing Address: 20 Jie-Shih Road, Siying, Zhan-Jiang, Kwangtung province</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A BEGINNING IN KULING MOUNTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the most recent letters from Foochow, more than twenty brothers and sisters have arrived there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>P'ing-Yang sent the most brothers and sisters, Swatow was second.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The brothers and sisters began going up the mountain in different groups on June 4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After they arrived on the mountain, they met every morning from 8:00 to 10:00.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After a break, they continued meeting until 12:00.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the afternoon there was rest until 3:00 and then work by assignments.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There were also meetings in the evenings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Editor</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>WAITING IN LAN-CHOU</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>..I have not written since coming to the Northwest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have recently felt led by the Lord to simply discuss my past, present, and future with you brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope you will pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was in Tsingtao, it seemed that I received a calling for the remote regions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the seven years that I waited before leaving Tsingtao, I became more and more aware of my spiritual poverty and weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I felt that I may not have had a calling, and so my purpose in going west was to do business and serve a little in the matter of hospitality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I came to Lan-chou and used up almost all of my capital.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord made provision for me to come to Kansu College as an accountant.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In that year God seemed to remind me of His calling through 1 Timothy 6:11-12 and 2 Timothy 1:6-8.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when I considered the problem of my lack of gift, knowledge, and eloquence, I was held back by an invisible force.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the morning of January 14, 1945, the Lord seemed to give me a clear revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seemed as if a voice spoke to me, "Your name is not Shi-xin, which translated means new,' nor is it decrease'; it should be John,' who said, He must increase, but I must decrease.'"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After I changed my name, I had a deep realization that the work before me did not require my gift or knowledge for the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, I should rely on the Lord's grace to pioneer and prepare His way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since I received the brothers' confirmation and sending, I boldly ignored my own feelings and took my family on the road to Yungchang for two years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then I went to Wuwei.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Lee Yin-xin arrived in Lan-chou in winter and sent us an invitation to come to him for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He brought me into His light in one of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Little by little I saw that my previous work was like the situation in Judges, where everyone did what was right in his own eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If one has not been connected with the source, how can one speak of work and service!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, I had to put those activities aside, despite calls from Yungchang and Wuwei and their attempts to persuade me to return quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am peaceful remaining in Lan-chou to learn to serve God with the brothers here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can only wait for His clearer revelation and leading with regard to my future.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I really hope the brothers will take time to teach me about God's up-to-date desire and the way He wants to take.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May the Lord be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John Lee</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>April 12, 1948</S>
