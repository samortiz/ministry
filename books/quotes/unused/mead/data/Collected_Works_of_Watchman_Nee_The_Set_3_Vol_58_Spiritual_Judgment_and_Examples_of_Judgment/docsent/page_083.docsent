   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 62 Date:September 21, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER S. M.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I became a Christian at the age of seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In my youth I was always sick.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was married in Luo-Yang and met with the local church in Sian.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time I was very seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I dealt with sins and also experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I consecrated myself to the Lord and my whole family eventually was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once, I became sick during a period of darkness, and I asked God to take me away.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later, my husband and I mutually confessed our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The next day the swelling in my stomach left, and I recovered gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT Being Enlarged by the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our sister has not learned many lessons, because her years in the Lord are short.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She is not very experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both the work of the cross and the discipline of the Spirit are for the purpose of enlarging man's capacity before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The cross can enlarge man's capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are narrow because we experience little working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more the cross works on us, the more our measure is enlarged, and the more we are willing to deny ourselves and all that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know that the Lord's heart is large.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through His cross man's heart can also be enlarged beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as a man touches the cross, he begins to be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He can even pray for his own enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who can pray for their enemies are enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The cross can enlarge a person and make his heart as large as the heart of the crucified Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more crosses a person receives, the more he is enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fact that Stephen was able to pray for his enemies proves that he was enlarged by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The cross was manifested in him as much as it was manifested in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Accepting God's Arrangements</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our sister prayed for death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She also prayed for repentance, for recovery, and for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person prays for death only because he does not appreciate the environment that God has arranged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He despises and hates God's arrangement, and he is disappointed by it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You are not willing to accept God's arrangement and are disappointed by it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the reason you prayed for death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please remember that this is not a matter of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a sign that speaks of your hidden rejection of God's right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It speaks of a secret, rebellious spirit, a disobedient will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should learn to bow our heads before God and submit to all of His arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we find God's arrangement different from our will, we should ask for grace to appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although what happened to you is over, you should find out why these things came upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A Christian should learn to kiss the hand that orders his environment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We become disappointed when we encounter many things that we dislike and are unable to change them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When God orders such circumstances for us, we should learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to know that many things are impossible with man, but all things are possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have to learn to trust and obey.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being Careful and Serious</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our sister's speaking gave me the impression that she is not a careful person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Her testimony and prayer show that she is not that concerned with small details.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She is careless, unfocused, and unconcerned about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hope that our sister will receive mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A sister should be careful and serious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She should not be negligent or sloppy in anything before the Lord, and she should consider everything in a sober way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everything that you do should be done to God, not to those around you, such as your husband and children.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We live before God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our immediate relationship is not with man, but with God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Men may excuse us for many things, but we should be sober before God concerning these things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Careless persons are off in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our walk and our living are before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Men may let us get by with many things, but we have to seek to walk perfectly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God told Abraham to be perfect before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our God is a God of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps this is what you need.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have to accept God's arrangements, and you have to be more sober in your living.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You should no longer be careless or sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Otherwise, your daily life will affect your Christian life.</S>
