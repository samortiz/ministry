   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. BY MINISTERING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we would present others mature in Christ, we must minister the church as the mystery of Christ, as the ex- pension of Christ Eph 3:4; 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In his subtlety, Satan has caused many seeking Christians to avoid the matter of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My experience with Brother T. Austin-Sparks illustrates how persistently some avoid the church matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At our invitation, he came to Taiwan in 1955.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We had a wonderful time together as he ministered on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He could clearly echo what we had seen about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1957 he came to Taiwan a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On this visit he touched the church ground, the standing of the church, in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1958 I accepted his invitation to visit him in England.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the days we were together, we had many long conversations about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, he could not change my mind, and I could not change his concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He tried his best to avoid the subject of the church, but my concept was that we must labor for the building up of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His intention was to convince us that we should give up the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But I pointed out to him that it was impossible for us to have the church practically without the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Sparks tried to assure me that he was not opposed to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He went on to tell me that during the early years of his ministry, he was invited to speak in Edinburgh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he spoke about Christ, the meeting hall was crowded, and the audience was responsive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But when he spoke about the church, the number of people decreased.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This caused him to feel that it was not profitable for him to speak on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I went on to ask Brother Sparks how we could practice the principles we both had seen concerning the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He admitted that these principles could not be put into practice in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But he would not admit that they could be put into practice only on the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, he emphasized the fact that the church can be produced only by much prayer and through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then I said to him, Do you think that so many churches on the island of Taiwan did not all come into existence by prayer and through the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I asked him what a group of saints should do after they had prayed regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Still he would not admit that they should take the standing of the church on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He simply said that they needed to be assured that any move they made was of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the conclusion of our conversation about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I tried my best to convince him concerning the church, and he tried his best to avoid the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, neither of us would change our position.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today a battle is raging over the church as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Due to the subtlety of the enemy, most Christian bookstores will sell Brother Nee s books on spirituality, but not his books on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christians, however, cannot become full-grown without the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Nee s books related to spiritual matters have been popular with Christians around the world for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the popularity of these books has not caused the condition of Christianity to improve very much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the church life, the help people received from Brother Nee s books would eventually leak away because the church life is the only proper vessel to preserve this help.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For some, the spiritual books by Brother Nee for the most part supply new doctrinal concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not much is gained for the fulillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Does the Lord want people who only seek after spirituality, but who do not participate in the proper church life?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Apart from the church, God s purpose cannot be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because we realize this, the Lord s burden concerning the church presses heavily upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to practice the church life for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also need to be faithful to minister the church as the mystery of Christ, as the very expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord s desire is to have the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He does not want the church in terminology He wants the church in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order for the church life to be practical, there must be local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is made clear in The Practical Expression of the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today the practical expression of the church can only be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Oh, may we all learn to minister the church as the mystery of Christ, as His expression, in order that others may be presented full-grown in Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some have claimed that the ministry concerning the church has no future because the opposition against it is so widespread and intense.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Certainly if this ministry is simply the work of man, it has no future.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if this ministry is the ministry in the Lord s recovery, the future will be bright.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more others advise us not to minister on the church, the more we must be faithful to minister regarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must be bold and faithful to speak not only of Christ, the Head, but also of the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must not follow today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>On the contrary, we must follow the pure Word to minister the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>BY MINISTERING CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>TO HIS MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Finally, we need to minister Christ as life to His members so that they may live by Him and grow with Him unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life, and in John 6:57; 14:19; and Galatians 2:20 we see that we need to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we shall grow with Him unto maturity Eph 4:15, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we desire to present others full-grown in Christ, we must minister to them all the matters we have considered in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What a great need there is for the believers to be infused with all the things related to God s economy!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we are faithful to minister these crucial points, we shall be able to present others full-grown in Christ.</S>
