<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JEREMIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>JEREMIAH'S CALL AND COMMISSION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Jer. 1:4-19</H1><P>In this message we will consider 1:4-19. This portion tells us first how Jeremiah was called by God and then how he was commissioned by Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. JEREMIAH'S CALL</H2><P>In verses 5 through 8 we see Jeremiah's call.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Appointed by God<br>as a Prophet to the Nations</H2><P>In verse 5c God said to Jeremiah, "I have appointed you as a prophet to the nations." Literally, the Hebrew word translated appointed here means "given." God gave, appointed, Jeremiah to be a prophet not only to the nation of Israel but to all the nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Known by God<br>before Being Formed in the Womb by Him</H2><P>In verse 5a God said to Jeremiah, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you." Realizing the poor situation of Israel in relation to Him, God knew Jeremiah even before He purposely formed him in his mother's womb to be a prophet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Sanctified by God<br>before Coming Forth from the Womb</H2><P>God also said to Jeremiah, "Before you came forth from the womb, I sanctified you" (v. 5b). How good it is that before Jeremiah was born he was already sanctified!</P>
