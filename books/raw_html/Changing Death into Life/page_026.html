        <h2 class="head1">WORKING FOR THE FOOD THAT ABIDES<br />
UNTO ETERNAL LIFE&mdash;CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus spoke a long word to show these people that their real need was not physical food but eternal life (v. 27). Eternal life does not perish; it exists forever and abides unto eternity. The Lord Jesus said that He is eternal life; He is the food that abides unto eternal life. He is the One who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world. He is the bread of life (v. 35). Anyone who comes to Him shall by no means hunger, and anyone who believes into Him shall by no means ever thirst (v. 35). He is what man needs. Only He can supply man and give man true satisfaction. Only He can be man&rsquo;s life and cause man to live forever. He does not give man physical bread but the bread of life. He gives man spiritual life, not physical things.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s real need is life. Without the divine life, everything in the human life comes to an end. The human life lacks the divine life. The human life is insufficient and empty; it cannot meet man&rsquo;s need. The human life is also temporary and mortal; it cannot enable man to live forever. Only the life of the Lord Jesus is rich, solid, and eternal. His life can meet every need of the human life and enable man to live forever. The life of the Lord Jesus is the Lord Himself (1:4). He wants to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and life supply for man&rsquo;s satisfaction. For this reason, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who comes to Me shall by no means hunger&rdquo; (6:35). The phrase <em>by no means hunger</em> implies that there will be no lack, no emptiness; it means &ldquo;being filled and satisfied.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said that we should work for Him, the food that abides unto eternal life. This means that we should choose Him, receive Him, and gain Him.</p>
<p>We need to be prudent. Those who are prudent make good choices. Why should we choose what is inferior over what is superior? Why should we choose something that perishes over something that abides unto eternal life? Human history proves that physical things do not abide unto eternal life. Why are we still deceived by physical things? Why do we not choose the food that abides unto eternal life? This food is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is our real need.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW CHRIST CAN BECOME OUR FOOD</h2>
<p>Christ said to those who were hungry and seeking Him, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh...He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life...For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him&rdquo; (vv. 51, 54-56). He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I came to be the bread of life for you to eat and enjoy. You can eat Me and enjoy Me. If you eat Me, you will have eternal life; you will receive Me into you as your life.&rdquo; This word is perplexing and hard to understand. It is no wonder that those who heard this word said to one another, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to eat?&rdquo; (v. 52). They asked how He could be their food.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink&rdquo; (v. 55). The significance of this statement is very profound. When we eat mutton or beef, we are eating the flesh of a sheep or a cow. In order for a sheep or a cow to give us its flesh to eat, it must first be killed. When it is killed, it will shed its blood. What the Lord Jesus said has the Old Testament as its background. We may not understand what the Lord Jesus said, but the Jews understood Him. The Jews celebrated the Feast of the Passover every year. During this feast they killed a lamb and ate its flesh, and they applied the blood of the slaughtered lamb on the doorposts and the lintel (cf. Exo. 12). The Jews understood the passover, and the Lord Jesus said this to remind them of the passover. He seemed to be saying, &ldquo;The blood of the passover lamb redeemed you from your sins, and the flesh of the lamb became your food to satisfy you. I will be the same to you. I will be slain and will shed My blood just like the lamb. My blood will redeem you from your sins, and My slain flesh will become your food to satisfy you. Without My shed blood, you cannot be redeemed from your sins. Without My slain flesh, you cannot receive the indestructible, eternal life. Without Me as your bread of life, you will die in your sins. I am the bread of life. If you eat of Me as the bread of life, you shall by no means die, because this bread of life is the living flesh. In order for you to eat My living flesh, My blood must be shed. My shed blood redeems you from all your sins before God. When you are redeemed from your sins, you will also be delivered out of condemnation and death. Moreover, My living flesh, the eternal life, will enter into you so that you may live forever. Therefore, he who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life and lives forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ said that His flesh was true food and that His blood was true drink, He was referring to His death on the cross in which He gave His body and shed His blood for our redemption from sins so that we might receive Him as our life.</p>
<p>There are two key points here. First, every person is sinful before God. As a result, according to the righteous law of God, we deserve to die. Therefore, no one can escape death. Death means perdition. This is our first condition. Second, our human life does not have the ability to live forever. Our life is mortal. Therefore, we are not living daily; we are dying daily. The more we live, the closer we are to death. We live until the day we die. When the Chinese celebrate the New Year or any joyful occasion, they like to write words, such as <em>blessing, prosperity, longevity, joy,</em> and <em>peace from heaven,</em> on red paper and post them. However, no one writes the word <em>death,</em> and no one wants to mention it, because no one likes death. Whether or not we like death, one day death will come and swallow us up. This is our second condition. Thus, we have these two conditions: sin and death.</p>
<p>In order for Christ to give Himself to us as our life, He must first deal with sin and death, because these are our conditions. How does He deal with sin and death? On the one hand, He gave His body and shed His blood on the cross. He shed His blood to redeem us from our sins before God. On the other hand, when His body was broken and slain on the cross, the divine life within Him was released (John 12:24). Now this life can enter into us to be our life, thus delivering us from death. Let us use a grain of wheat as an example. When the grain is sown into the soil, its outer shell is broken, and the life within the seed is released. This life then grows into wheat and bears many grains. In this way, the life that was originally in one grain is released into many grains. How wonderful is Christ&rsquo;s salvation! He shed His blood to wash away our sins, and His body was broken to release the life within Him. If you believe that He died for you on the cross and shed His blood to redeem you from your sins, you will receive Him. Then His life will become your life, and His element will become your element.</p>
<p>Animals need to pass through death in order to become man&rsquo;s food and enjoyment, and plants also need to pass through death in order to become man&rsquo;s food and enjoyment. Every living thing needs to pass through death in order to become man&rsquo;s food. Birds, cattle, and sea animals and also fruit, grain, and herbs must pass through death, through breaking, before they can become our food, enjoyment, and nourishment. Likewise, in order to become the bread of life for our enjoyment, Jesus Christ passed through death. He said that His flesh is true food and that His blood is true drink. This implies His death, because death is needed in order for flesh to be separated from the blood. When the Lord Jesus died, His blood and flesh were separated (cf. 19:34). Hence, we can enjoy Him. Through the death that separated His flesh and blood, He became the bread of life. Now we can eat Him as our life supply.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ the Savior does not teach doctrines; rather, He enters into man to be assimilated by man as man&rsquo;s food, life, and enjoyment. How does the Lord Jesus give Himself to us? He gave Himself to us on the cross when His body was broken and His blood was shed. His blood washes away our sins and resolves our case before God so that our sins may be forgiven. Furthermore, through His death on the cross His life was released and entered into us to be our bread of life and our element. Thus, He is assimilated into us. If you are willing to believe in Him, you will eat His flesh and drink His blood; in other words, you will eat and enjoy Him.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
