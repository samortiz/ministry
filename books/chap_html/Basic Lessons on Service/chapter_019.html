Lesson thirteen is on the danger and loss of not using our gift. Lesson fourteen is on the strange fire. Lesson fifteen shows us that we need to take heed how to build. We should not build with wood, grass, or stubble, but with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). Lesson sixteen speaks of the impotence of our natural being in the things of God. Then we saw in lessons seventeen and eighteen that we need to know the flesh in a thorough way.</P><P>We have to help the saints realize that in the service of the church we must know all these negative things. If we are not clear about these negative things and do not have a thorough clearance from these negative things, we can never have a proper church service. If we are not cleared up from all these negative things, we are still in Christianity in nature. So it is worthwhile for us to stay with the saints on all these negative points.</P><P>In this lesson we want to see the need for the denial of the self in our service to the church. The outline for this lesson is simple, but there is the need for much development, labor, and prayer on our part to enter into its intrinsic significance.</P>
