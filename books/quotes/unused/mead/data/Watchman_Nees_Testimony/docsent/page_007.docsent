   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GIVING UP MY FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this audience there are at least three schoolmates of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Among them is Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi, who can testify concerning what an ill-behaved student I was, as well as what a wonderful student I was in school.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the evil side, I often violated the school rules.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the good side, I was always first in every examination, because God had bestowed intelligence on me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My essays were frequently posted on the bulletin board for exhibition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time I was a youth with many grand dreams and many plans for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I considered my judgments sound.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I can humbly say that had I worked hard in the world, it would have been quite possible for me to have had great success.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My schoolmates can also testify to this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But following my salvation many new things happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All my previous planning became void and was brought to nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My future career was entirely abandoned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For some this step might be easy, but for me, with many ideals, dreams, and plans, it was exceedingly difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the evening I was saved, I began to live a new life, for the life of the eternal God had entered into me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My salvation and calling to serve the Lord took place simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since that evening, I have never once had any doubts about being called.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During that hour I decided on my future career once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I realized that, on the one hand, the Lord had saved me for my sake, and at the same time, He did so for His own sake.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wanted me to obtain His eternal life, and He also wanted me to serve Him and be His co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a boy I did not understand the nature of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When I was older, I considered it the most trifling and base of occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In those days most preachers were employed by European or American missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were servile subordinates to the missionaries and earned merely eight or nine dollars per month.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I had no intention of becoming a preacher nor even a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I could never have imagined that I would choose the profession of a preacher, a profession which I despised and considered trifling and base.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>LEARNING TO SERVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After being saved, I continued on in school, though I had little interest in books.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others read novels in class, but I diligently studied the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Editor's note: Although Brother Nee studied the Bible in class, he still came first in the end-of-term examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later, desiring to pursue spiritual things further, I left school and entered Dora Yu's Bible Institute in Shanghai Editor's note: a famous lady evangelist .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, before long she politely dismissed me, and I returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The reason she gave for her action was that it was inconvenient for me to stay there any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I realized that my flesh had not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was still fond of good food and fine clothing, and I enjoyed sleeping until eight o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Dora Yu felt I was good material for the Lord's interest and had good prospects, but when she discovered my laziness, she sent me home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time I was thoroughly disappointed and felt my future was doomed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time I even questioned my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But surely I was saved!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I even considered that I was quite good and that I had been transformed in many ways, not realizing that there was much yet to be learned and much to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Confident that the Lord had saved me and called me, I could not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I admitted that I was not yet good enough, but I felt that with the passing of more time I would improve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since the time was not ripe for me to continue my spiritual pursuits, I decided to return to school.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When my schoolmates saw me, they recognized that I had changed, but I had not changed thoroughly, for I still occasionally lost my temper and did some things wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There were times when I seemed very much like a saved person, but at other times I seemed very much like an unsaved person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, my testimony in the school was not very powerful, and when I witnessed to Brother Weigh, he paid no heed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Editor's note: Brother Nee's prayers and guidance finally brought Brother Weigh to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After I was saved, I spontaneously loved the souls of sinners and hoped that they would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To this end, I began to preach the gospel and to bear testimony among my schoolmates.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After nearly a year's work, however, no one was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I thought the more words I could speak and the more reasons I could present, the more effective I would be in saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But though I had much to speak concerning the Lord, my words lacked power to move the listeners.</S>
