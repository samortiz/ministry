   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SPIRIT'S ACTIVITIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our spiritual life there are many things that should be done.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this reason, the work of the mind cannot be neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Being filled in our spirit is different from the ocean tide coming in and going out at will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be filled in the spirit, we must fulfill its requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This implies that the mind must initiate what the spirit is ready to do but has not yet begun.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we sit and wait for the sense of the spirit, it will never come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Neither should we overemphasize the work of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should know that only the activities that are done in the spirit have spiritual value; therefore, we should not walk according to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then why do we use the mind?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We use the mind, but it is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, our purpose is to stir up the spirit to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The spirit must be the one who works.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the spirt is still very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Employing the mind is simply for stirring up the work of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, when we apply the mind to draw up the spirit, if there is neither a response nor an experience of the anointing after a period of time, the work of the mind in that regard should cease and turn in another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In spiritual warfare as well, if we have a sense of "void" within us for a long period and no sense of the spirit, we should stop; however, we should not stop simply because of the impatience of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although sometimes we are weary, we know that we should continue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At other times we know that we should stop.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no fixed law.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the mind to assist the spirit in this way is like priming a mechanical pump.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some pumps require a cup of water to be poured in first in order to create some suction power which draws the water up as we are pumping.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The relationship of our mind to the spirit is the same as the cup of water to the pump.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not use a cup of water as a starter, water cannot be drawn up; similarly, if we do not initiate with our mind, the spirit will not rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not use the mind to initiate prayer, it is like a person who does not pour in a cup of water, and after pumping a couple of times, says that there is no water in the well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Truly there are differences in the work of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes it is as strong as a lion, and sometimes it is as indecisive as a babe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When our spirit is weak and cannot help itself, the mind should act as the spirit's nursing mother to look after it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The mind cannot replace the spirit, but it can assist the spirit to enliven it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the spirit descends from its controlling position, the believer should use the power of the mind to pray and raise it up again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Should the spirit sink because of oppression, the believer should use his mind to examine the condition and then pray strongly until the spirit rises up to be liberated again.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A spiritual mind can maintain the tranquil position of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The mind can restrict excessive activities of the spirit and also uplift an excessively depressed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simply speaking, our spirit can only be filled again by the activities of our mind in the spiritual realm .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In principle, whatever we have done in the spirit, we should now do with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then when the Holy Spirit anoints us, it confirms that we are doing it in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the beginning of a certain situation, you may not have any sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, once you acquire the sense of the spirit, this indicates that the spirit wanted to work this way, but it was too weak to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through the assistance of the mind, it is able to express what it previously was unable to express.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever we need in the spirit can be obtained by simply considering in our mind and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way we will be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regarding assisting the spirit, another point must be observed: spiritual warfare involves spirit warring with spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When our spirit wrestles with the evil spirit, the strength of our entire being is one with the spirit for the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The most important part is our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The entire strength of the spirit and the mind must be united together for the attack.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the spirit becomes suppressed and loses its strength to resist, the mind should continually fight for the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When the mind fights by praying, resisting, and opposing, the spirit will receive a supply to rise up once again for the battle.</S>
