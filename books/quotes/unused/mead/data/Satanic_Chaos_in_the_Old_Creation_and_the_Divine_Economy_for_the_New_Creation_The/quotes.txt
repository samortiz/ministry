[2]  AND THE SATANIC CHAOS 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1-2, 26-28; 2:7-9 OUTLINE In the preadamic age: The divine economy: God's creation of the heavens and the earth Gen 1:1; Job 38:4-6.
[3]  In the fall of man: The divine economy: God promised Adam that Christ would come as the seed of woman to destroy the serpent Satan Gen 3:14-15.
[4]  God promised to let man have life signifying God's eternal life and provided man with covering typifying God's coming redemption in Christ Gen 3:20-21.
[5]  In the further steps and consummation of man's fall: The divine economy: Abel accepted God's promise in offering the firstlings of his flock typifying Christ to receive God's respect Gen 4:4.
[6]  Noah walked with God and prepared the ark typifying Christ for the carrying out of the divine economy Gen 6:8-22.
[7]  In the raising up of a new race of mankind: The divine economy with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: God called Abraham out of the land of idolatry and brought him into the land of His promise Gen 11:31; 12:4.
[8]  God promised Abraham His blessing of the gospel to the nations in the seed of Abraham Christ as the centrality and universality of the divine economy Gen 12:2-3; 18:18; 22:18.
[9]  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob built an altar for the offerings typifying Christ to Jehovah and lived in a tent as pilgrims, looking forward to the consummation of the divine economy Gen 12:7-8; 26:25; 33:18-20; Heb 11:9.
[10]  God provided the people of Israel in the wilderness with manna from heaven typifying Christ and water typifying the Spirit out of the moving rock typifying Christ Exo 16:1 17:7; 1 Cor 10:3-4.
[11]  In the Old Testament: The divine economy concerning the tabernacle, the offerings, and the priests: God charged the people of Israel to build the tabernacle typifying Christ for His dwelling and to serve Him by the priests through the offerings both typifying Christ Exo 25 Lev 27.
[12]  Israel entered into the good land Josh 3 4.
[13]  The divine economy with David, Solomon, and the positive prophets: God raised up David as a man after His own heart to do His will 1 Sam 13:14.
[14]  The general subject of this book is the satanic chaos in the old creation and the divine economy for the new creation.
[15]  Such a subject may seem quite peculiar, strange, and extraordinary.
[16]  You have heard that Jesus Christ is our Savior, Lord, and Master and that He is our life, nature, and person, but probably you have never heard that Jesus Christ is also the divine economy.
[17]  However, my initial feeling of joy did not last long.
[18]  A few days later I became angry with my mother.
[19]  God's intention is to produce the new creation out of the old creation.
[20]  God created the first creation, which has become the old creation.
[21]  In the preadamic age, the divine economy in the creation of the universe was followed by the satanic chaos.
[22]  The tree of life is a figure of Christ as the embodiment of the divine life.
[23]  Thus, when God put man in front of the tree of life, He was indicating that man should take God in Christ as life for the carrying out of the divine economy.
[24]  In the further steps of the fall, man became flesh and man's sin became great, so man was judged by God with the flood Gen 6:3, 5-7, 13; 7:10-11, 17-23a .
[25]  The gospel is the good news that Christ has destroyed Satan, that He has redeemed us from our sins, that He has brought God to us and us to God for our enjoyment of God's blessing, and that He has brought us into the kingdom, where God reigns through His redeemed as His organism.
[26]  D. The Satanic Chaos with the People of Israel
[27]  With the people of Israel in the wilderness, we see not only the divine economy but also the satanic chaos.
[28]  AND THE SATANIC CHAOS 2 Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; Rev 21:1-3; 22:1-2, 16-21 OUTLINE In the New Testament: Concerning Christ and His ministry: The divine economy with Christ as the God-man: Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God became incarnated to be a God-man John 1:1, 14; Luke 1:26-38; Matt 1:18-23.
[29]  John the Baptist came out to testify concerning Christ Matt 3:1-12; John 1:6-8, 15, 19-36.
[30]  The seekers of Messiah came to Christ and followed Him John 1:37-49; Matt 4:17-24; John 3:1-15.
[31]  Christ revealed to His followers the kingdom of the heavens Matt 5 7 , the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens Matt 13 , Christ and the church Matt 16:13-19 , the consummation of this age and the second coming of Christ Matt 24 25 , and the mystery of the Divine Trinity in union with the believers of Christ John 14 17 .
[32]  The divine economy in Christ's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension: God judged Christ on the cross for the sin of the world and for the sin of the believers John 1:29; 1 Cor 15:3 , and Christ died an all-inclusive vicarious death John 19:34; 12:24 .
[33]  In dealing with humankind, God deals with only two races.
[34]  These are the Adamic race, the race created by God, and the Abrahamic race, the race chosen by God.
[35]  This race failed God to the uttermost at Babel, where, in union with Satan to frustrate the divine economy, they rebelled against God, exalted themselves, and worshipped idols.
[36]  These verses say, "As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[37]  There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[38]  Abraham has only one seed, Christ v. 16 . Hence, to be Abraham's seed we must be of Christ, be a part of Christ.
[39]  Because we are one with Christ, we too are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God's promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.
[40]  IN THE NEW TESTAMENT A. Concerning Christ and His Ministry
[41]  Concerning Christ and His ministry, the New Testament reveals that there were both the divine economy and the satanic chaos.
[42]  The followers of Christ discovered His resurrection and received the revelation that Christ in His humanity was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God with His many brothers constituting the Body Matt 28:1-10; John 20:1-18; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11-12 .
[43]  The revelation was that the very Christ who was in the flesh was born in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God and that all His believers were born at that same time to be the many sons of God and the many brothers of Christ who constitute His Body, the church.
[44]  Acts 1:3 tells us that, as part of the divine economy, Christ in His resurrection taught His eleven apostles concerning the kingdom of God for forty days.
[45]  According to the record in the book of Acts, the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly 6:7; 12:24; 19:20 .
[46]  Among the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the first one lost her first love toward the Lord 2:4 ; the third one fell into the world where Satan's throne is, held the teaching of Balaam involved with idolatry and fornication, and held also the teaching of the Nicolaitans related to hierarchy 2:13-15 ; the fourth one had the teaching of Jezebel involved with fornication, idolatry, and the deep things of Satan 2:20, 24a ; the fifth one was living in name, yet she was dead, with nothing perfect before God 3:1-2 ; and the last one, in Laodicea, was lukewarm, boasting in her "riches," but not realizing her wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked condition, with the Lord Christ standing outside and knocking at her door 3:14-17, 20 .
[47]  CHAPTER THREE THE OVERCOMERS Scripture Reading: Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 OUTLINE Not disappointed or discouraged but strengthened and enabled to stand for and live out the divine economy.
[48]  To conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy: By the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-sufficient grace 1 Cor 15:10; 2 Cor 12:9; 2 Tim 4:22.
[49]  According to the truth, of which the church, the manifestation of God in the flesh, is the pillar and base 1 Tim 3:15-16.
[50]  Enjoying eating Christ as the tree of life in the church as today's Paradise to be a shining lampstand --Rev 2:7, 5.
[51]  Keeping the Lord's word of endurance and not denying the Lord's name unto the last bit of their power, that they may be kept out of the hour of trial, which is coming to try all those who dwell on the earth, and that they may receive the crown of reward to be pillars in the temple of God with the name of God, the name of the city of God, the New Jerusalem, and Christ's new name written upon them Rev 3:8b, 10-12.
[52]  Now I would like to present an overview of the twenty-two chapters of the book of Revelation.
[53]  The worldly church lost the enjoyment of Christ in a hidden way as the hidden manna v. 17 . Thus, this church was filled with the satanic chaos and was under the rebuking of Christ.
[54]  When Christ opened the fifth seal, John saw a group of martyrs under the altar, that is, underneath the earth v. 9 . These martyrs cried out, "How long, O Master, holy and true, will You not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?" v. 10 . The Lord told these martyrs to "rest yet a little while, until also the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed, even as they were, is completed" v. 11 . The cry of the martyred saints must occur near the end of this age.
[55]  Now that we have received an overview of the book of Revelation, we need to consider where we are and who we are.
[56]  As long as we are living in the church life, we are ready to take one more step to cross the threshold into the kingdom, the New Jerusalem, which is called the Paradise of God Rev 2:7 .
[57]  The marriage dinner of the Lamb as the wedding feast will be a reward to the overcoming believers.
[58]  After the marriage dinner, Christ will come as a fighting General with His bride as His army to fight against and defeat Antichrist and the kings under him with their armies at Armageddon Rev 19:11-21 .
[59]  The defeat of Antichrist will end human government on earth, and Christ with His overcomers as co-kings will reign in His kingdom to rule over all the nations on earth for one thousand years vv.
[60]  Revelation 2 and 3 reveal that we need to conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy in certain conditions.
[61]  As the overcomers, we need to be transformed to be a "white stone," justified and approved by the Lord, for the building up of the house of God, with a "new name" according to the transformation in life Rev 2:17b .
[62]  Now I would like to say something concerning the Lord's move in Russia.
[63]  On the one hand, Rome conquered and captured Palestine.
[64]  But on the other hand, Rome prepared a good environment for the Lord Jesus to be born.
[65]  Over one thousand years ago, Russia was a wild country without a written language or a civilized culture.
[66]  Then the Greek missionaries of the Greek Orthodox Church went to Russia.
[67]  CHAPTER FOUR GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Col 3:10-11; 1:15-19; Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5; Eph 3:8-11, 2; 4:15-16; 1:10; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:10-12; Matt 16:18-19; Rom 14:17; Heb 1:8; Rev 21:1-3; 22:1-2 OUTLINE Taking Christ as its centrality and universality Col 3:10-11.
[68]  Making Christ preeminent in all things Col 1:15-19: In the Godhead v. 15a.
[69]  Producing the church to be: The Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23: The fullness of Him who fills all in all to be His expression.
[70]  The house of God 1 Tim 3:15-16: Composed of the many sons of God as the many brothers of Christ, the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29; Heb 2:10-12.
[71]  We have seen in the previous chapter that there are four races in the eyes of God the Adamic race, the Abrahamic race according to the flesh, the Abrahamic race according to the Spirit, and the overcoming race.
[72]  Today we are near the end of a period of six thousand years since the creation of Adam.
[73]  BEING AN OVERCOMER TO CONQUER JUDAISM, CATHOLICISM, AND PROTESTANTISM
[74]  My burden in this chapter is to show us how to conquer the satanic chaos and what to conquer.
[75]  Christ is the centrality and universality of the divine economy Col 3:10-11 .
[76]  Everything we do must be in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, through Christ, and to Christ.
[77]  Christ also has the preeminence, the first place, in the creation Col 1:15b-17 .
[78]  Christ is also preeminent in the resurrection for the new creation, the church, the Body of Christ v. 18 . In the old creation, He is the Firstborn.
[79]  Christ is the center, Christ is the embodiment, Christ is the image, and Christ is the fullness.
[80]  God's economy takes Christ as its centrality and universality, makes Christ preeminent in all things, and also produces the church to be the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God, consummating in the holy city, the New Jerusalem.
[81]  We are here living a church life to take Christ as the center and to make Christ the preeminent One for the purpose of producing the church, the Body of Christ.
[82]  The Body of Christ is an organism constituted with His members Rom 12:5 .
[83]  As the members of the Body of Christ, we are the living parts of Christ.
[84]  The Body of Christ needs to be built up with the unsearchable riches of Christ through the divine dispensing Eph 3:8-11, 2 .
[85]  The church as the house of God is also the pillar and base of the truth.
[86]  The truth is just one thing the Triune God, having Christ as the center, the embodiment, the image, and the expression, to produce the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God.
[87]  CHAPTER FIVE THE CHURCH LIFE IN GOD'S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Phil 1:20-21a; John 21:15-17; Rev 2:4; Phil 3:12; 1 Cor 1:9; Col 1:12, 18b; 1 Tim 4:6; Eph 4:3-4, 12, 16; 3:8-10, 2; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:11; John 17:21-23; Rev 1:12, 20b; 1 Tim 3:15-16; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; 1 Cor 4:15; 1 Thes 2:7; 1 Pet 2:2; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14:1-5, 12, 31, 40; Col 3:10-11 OUTLINE To live and magnify Christ --Phil 1:20-21a: To love and treasure Christ --John 21:15-17; Rev 2:4.
[88]  To enjoy and partake of Christ --1 Cor 1:9; Col 1:12.
[89]  In chapters one and two, we saw the divine economy and the satanic chaos in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[90]  As a result of my preaching and teaching, a number of people gave up their denominations and came together to meet with me.
[91]  This bothered many of the pastors and elders of the denominations in Chefoo, especially since I grew up in that city and we knew one another.
[92]  Now that we have seen something concerning our standing as the church according to the divine revelation, we need to see the church life in God's economy.
[93]  The church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 , the organism of the Triune God, and this organism is the expression, the manifestation, of the invisible Triune God.
[94]  Today's Christianity is full of organization, but the church as the living Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God.
[95]  The first item in the church life in God's economy is that we need to be those who live and magnify Christ Phil 1:20-21a .
[96]  If we do not live Christ and magnify Christ in our daily life, we are not practical members of a practical church.
[97]  If people can see only what we are in our natural being, we are not living and magnifying Christ.
[98]  A. To Keep the Universal Oneness of the Body
[99]  In order to build up the Body of Christ, we need to keep the universal oneness of the Body Eph 4:3-4 .
[100]  The truth is the Triune God, taking Christ as His center and His circumference so that the church as the Body of Christ, as the organism of the Triune God, can be produced.
[101]  According to the divine revelation, the truth is the Triune God, taking Christ the Son as the embodiment and as the centrality and universality of His divine economy to have a church to express Him as His organism.
[102]  For the church life in God's economy, we need to meet and serve in mutuality according to the God-ordained way.
