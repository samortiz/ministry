<h1 class="title">TABERNACLED</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14; Rev. 21:3</h1>
<p>John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Revelation 21:3 says, &ldquo;The tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them.&rdquo; The Chinese Union Version translates the Greek word for <em>tabernacle</em> as &ldquo;dwell&rdquo;. In fact, however, these two verses use the noun <em>tabernacle</em> as a verb. John used this word to convey a particular meaning, not because he was forced to for lack of a better word. The particular meaning of this word may not be evident from John 1:14, but it is clear in Revelation 21:3. God will not only dwell with men, but God will tabernacle with them. This shows that the matter of God&rsquo;s dwelling with men does not involve a common dwelling; it involves a tabernacle that is erected for the purpose of dwelling.</p>
<p>God wants to dwell with men, but His dwelling should not be considered a common thing. He wants to dwell within men by erecting a tabernacle among them. Such a building involves grouping, coordinating, and building up people. It is not easy to understand the Gospel of John without seeing this matter of tabernacling.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN<br />
BEING GOD&rsquo;S GREAT DELIGHT</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s great delight is to enter into man, to be mingled with man, and to be joined with man. We often speak of wanting to love and please God. However, as the Lord shines upon us, He gradually brings us to the point of knowing that He is touched the most when we let Him mingle Himself with us. If we really love Him, we will see that no other matter pleases His heart more than to let Him mingle Himself with us. This is not a matter of doctrine but of our practical living. If our living on this earth comes out of our being mingled with God, He will be pleased to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Many people are able to do things for the Lord, such as paying a price to follow Him, enduring, and laboring in many works, but such things do not necessarily touch His heart. Without the mingling of God and man in these things, our works, regardless of how good they seem to be, will not be of much value in His eyes, because they will be done outside of Him. Every valuable work has the element of the mingling of God and man in it. Being mingled with man is the most pleasing thing to God. This is the Word becoming flesh (John 1:14).</p>
<p>The meaning of the Word becoming flesh is nothing less than God being mingled with man and being expressed through the flesh. God does not want to be expressed simply in His divinity; God wants to be mingled with humanity and expressed through humanity, through our flesh, such that His life and nature are expressed through our humanity. This is what God delights in the most.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN BEING<br />
FOR GOD TO GAIN A DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>God came to be mingled with man not only because He takes delight in this, but also because He wants a home in which to dwell, a resting place among us, with us, and in us. This involves not only entering into man to be joined and mingled with man but also building those who have been mingled with Him into His dwelling place.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the mingling of God and man over the years, and I have said repeatedly that the mingling of God and man is for building a dwelling place of God in man. I am concerned, however, that many of us do not see this vision, because we so easily deviate from this and pay attention to things other than God. I am not concerned that our deviation is related to bad things, such as sin or the world. Rather, if we are not inwardly absolute and single toward God, even good things, such as the gospel and the edification of the saints, can be deviations. If we are not absolute, we may hear this word and know the doctrine, but we may not truly see that more than anything else God wants to gain man, to mingle Himself with man, and to build man into His dwelling place. It is not easy to see such a vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN BEING<br />
FOR MAN TO TAKE GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Almost no one preaches the truth of the mingling of God and man or the truth of the building of God. There are many orthodox Christians who endeavor to preach the gospel and to bring people to salvation, and it is common for Christians to exhort others to love the Lord, to consecrate themselves, to live for the Lord, to do God&rsquo;s will, and to work for the Lord. Consequently, there are many who pursue spirituality and endeavor to live a holy life. However, among God&rsquo;s children, we seldom hear a message on God&rsquo;s desire to mingle Himself with man. Although people can speak in generalities about receiving God&rsquo;s life when they believed in the Lord and of needing to live by God&rsquo;s life, their living may not reflect the intrinsic reality that God is life in order to mingle Himself with us. The Gospel of John is a book on God as life, and it repeatedly shows that God wants man to receive Him as life, just as we receive food and water. Whatever we eat and drink becomes a part of our constitution. Similarly, God wants to be our inner constitution.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s being mingled with us does not mean that God&rsquo;s person becomes our person, nor does it mean that we become God in order to be worshipped. That is not the meaning of mingling at all. Mingling means that God&rsquo;s life and nature have been imparted into us to be our element, and although we are human beings, we can live by God&rsquo;s life in us instead of by our human life. Although we are human beings, our human nature has been mingled with God&rsquo;s nature. Hence, we can learn to express God&rsquo;s life and nature through our life and nature.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
