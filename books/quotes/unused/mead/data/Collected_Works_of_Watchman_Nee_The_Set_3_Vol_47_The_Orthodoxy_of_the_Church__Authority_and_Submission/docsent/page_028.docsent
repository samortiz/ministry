   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What is the reason for this problem?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must be very careful and humble or else we will become involved in the same failure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I think any kind of division is due to the lack of love for one another; when love does not exist or is lacking, people pay attention to laws, stress procedures, and split hairs to find faults.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once love is in distress, people will also be proud of themselves and envious of others, which produces controversy and strife.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit is the strength of oneness, while the flesh is the strength of division.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Unless the flesh is dealt with, division will occur sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, I believe the lack at that time was that the brothers did not see the "local'' ground and boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They clearly saw the sins of the church on the negative side, but on the positive side, they did not adequately see how the church should love one another and be of one accord on the ground and boundary of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Roman Catholic Church pays attention to the oneness of a united church on this earth, while the Brethren paid attention to an idealistic oneness of a spiritual church in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not see or did not see clearly enough that the love for one another in the epistles is the love for one another in the church in one locality; the oneness is the oneness of the church in one locality; the joining together is the joining together of the church in one locality; the edification is the edification of the church in a locality; and even the excommunication is the excommunication of the church in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In any case, only these two kinds of people talk about the oneness of the church: The Roman Catholic Church speaks of the unity of all the churches on this earth, while the Brethren speak of the spiritual oneness in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, the former is but a oneness in outward appearance, while the latter is an idealistic oneness that is, in fact, divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both have not noticed the oneness of each and every local church in each and every locality as recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the Brethren did not pay enough attention to the fact that the church has the locality as her boundary, the "Exclusive Brethren'' demanded unified action throughout in every place, resulting in breaking the boundary of locality and falling into the error of the united church; while the "Open Brethren'' demanded independent administration of every meeting, the result of which is that there are many places that have many churches in one locality, thus falling into the error of the Congregational Church, which makes each congregation an independent unit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The "Exclusive Brethren'' exceed the boundary of locality, while the "Open Brethren'' are smaller than the boundary of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They forget that in the Bible there is one and only one church in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The words spoken in the Bible to the church are spoken to this kind of church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Strangely enough, today's inclination is to change the words spoken in the Bible to the local church to words spoken to the spiritual church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Moreover, when some brothers set up the church, they set up a church that is smaller than the locality the "house'' church is a case in point.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But in the Bible there is no "United Church'' of the churches everywhere; neither are there churches of the congregations and meetings in one locality as independent churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One church for several localities or several churches in one locality both are not ordained of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's Word clearly reveals that one locality can have only one church, and there can only be one church in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To have one church in several localities demands a unity which the Bible does not demand; to have several churches in one locality divides the oneness which the Bible demands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The difficulty of the Brethren in those days was that they were not clear enough regarding the teaching in the Bible on locality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The result is that since those who have the "United Church'' type of unity are united with brothers in other places, they are not afraid to be divided from brothers in the same locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Similarly, those who take the meeting as a unit and who have no problem with the brothers in the same meeting are not afraid to be divided with the brothers who are in other meetings in the same locality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because they have not realized the importance of the teachings in the Bible concerning the locality, divisions have resulted in both cases.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord does not demand the impractical unity of all places.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord also does not permit taking one meeting as the boundary of unity that is too free; it is licentious, having no restriction or lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With just one word of disagreement, another meeting is formed immediately with three to five as a group, and this is counted as oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There can only be one kind of oneness in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a restriction to those with fleshly license!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The movement of the brothers is still in progress, and the light of "locality'' is clearer and clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To what extent the Lord will work we do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can only wait for history; then we will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If our consecration to the Lord is absolute and we ourselves are humble, it may be that we will receive mercy to be kept from error.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name'' Rev 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the time of Philadelphia there have been many cases of excommunicating the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But here they can no longer be excommunicated; they will be a pillar in the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the pillar is removed, the temple cannot stand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Philadelphia makes the temple of God stand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There are three names written on the overcomer the name of God, the name of the New Jerusalem, and the Lord's new name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's eternal plan is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The people in Philadelphia return to the Lord and satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches'' v. 13 . Please remember, God has not kept His heart's desire in secret; God has put the way very clearly before us.</S>
