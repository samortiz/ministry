However, he did not know the way of salvation. He asked one of his friends, "What should I do to be saved?" His friend was busy with his own work and answered him hastily, "Start with the first `all' in Isaiah 53:6 and end with the last `all,' and you will be saved." Indeed, when this person received with faith the fact of these two "alls," he was saved. Are you saved? Please try the same method.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD ANSWERING PRAYER</H2><P>There was a child who was called Henry. He was young, but he knew about God. He told his family that whenever one asks of God, God will answer him; He will never leave anything unanswered. The grown-ups in the family did not believe in God. They thought that God sometimes answers and sometimes does not answer. Once it was raining, and everyone told Henry, "If God hears your prayer, why don't you pray that it will not rain tomorrow?" Henry said, "Very good. I will pray." The next day it was still raining heavily. The others asked Henry, "Did God answer your prayer? See how heavy the rain is!" Henry answered, "God has indeed answered my prayer. He answered by saying, `No.'"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>A spiritual missionary once told me an experience of hers. She said that she was once in a certain denomination, and she was sent to work as a teacher in a parochial school. Because of her love for the Lord, she did much work among the students. She brought the unbelievers to salvation and perfected the believers. The Lord greatly blessed her work. Because of this, her co-workers became jealous of her.</P><P>Later, a person from her denomination accused her of many sins. The annual board committee would not announce the name of the accuser, nor would they tell her what charge was brought against her. They only sent a few persons to tell her that the denomination would no longer hire her and that she should pack up her belongings and go back to England. She was expelled. When she heard this, it was like an unexpected thunder from the sky; she did not know where the storm came from. She told the committee that she was willing to return home, but that they should tell her who was accusing her and what was the mistake she had made that forced her to return home. Even if she were a criminal, she could not be sentenced to the guillotine without a trial. But the committee was adamant in not telling her the name. Later, she committed the matter to God in her prayer. Because the blow was so great, she wept and cried before the Lord. She knew that she had not made any mistake that could cause her expulsion. She considered how her name and character would be slandered from that time on, and she decided that she would not give up unless the committee would tell her the truth and give her the chance to defend herself. The more she considered her future, the more her pride would not let her give in.</P><P>However, in her prayer, it seemed that she saw the Lord. The Lord taught her, "You belong to Me. Those who accused you also belong to Me. I am the Head, and both of you are My members. Consider My hands. What difference does it make to My head if it is the thumb or the middle finger that is hurt? To my head both cause pain. Whether you are hurt or the other is hurt, it is a fact that I have been hurt. Why do you have to argue? Why do you have to justify yourself and put shame on others? You may be able to save yourself from false accusations, but is not the hurt done to Me the same? Why justify yourself? My child, be at peace! Your future is in My hands!" After this, she returned to her country, and she suffered much misunderstanding and despising. Others thought that she had committed untold crimes! Today, she has been back at work in Fukien for over twenty years, but none of her former co-workers are left in China any longer!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 9</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENVIRONMENT</H2><P>A Bible salesman went to the villages to preach the gospel and to sell Bibles. He told others that the Holy Book is powerful to change men's behavior and to deliver them from judgment of sins and to keep them from sinning. One opposer stepped forward and asked, "How can this be? Who can be without sin in a sin-infested world? Can a man be free from the influence of his environment? What can you show me that is not affected by its environment?" The Bible salesman said, "The fish swims in the salty sea, but it does not turn into a salty fish! What is so threatening about the environment?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FASTEST WAY TO HELL</H2><P>A person who loved to joke once asked his Christian chauffeur, "What is the fastest way to hell?" The chauffeur said, "If you open the door and jump out, hell will be right there. But you should remember that if you do not believe in God, you will not be there, because there is no one in hell who does not believe in God!" Everyone in hell believes in God. James 2:19 says, "You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe and shudder."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BOOK OF THE HEART</H2><P>A near-illiterate person once read the "Holy Bible" as the "Heart Bible." The Bible becomes the Book of the Heart. This is probably what the ancient psalmist meant when he said in Psalm 119:111, "Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HEART OF THE PREACHERS</H2><P>One Monday morning, two preachers met each other on the road. One said, "Last night I spoke on `The coming of the Judgment Day.'" The other said, "I wish you would say this with tears." Indeed this is true. Acts 20:19 says, "Serving the Lord as a slave with all humility and tears."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHERE ONE CANNOT FIND CHRISTIANS</H2><P>One young man could not stand the zeal of his parents toward God. He could not bear the spiritual atmosphere at home, and he thought that there were too many Christians in his own town. He was tired of their presence and tired of their heavenly talk, and he set about to escape to a lake by train. On the train, he saw two old people opposite his seat with their Bibles open, discussing spiritual matters. He was angry at seeing so many Christians. At the next station, he left the train to give vent to his anger. There he saw a few old women talking to each other. When he approached them, he realized that they were also talking about the Lord Jesus. There was a lake in that place, and many people went on the lake. He took a steamboat to travel to the other side of the lake. On the boat, again he heard many people talking about heavenly things. They were all Christians! He found out later that they all belonged to a tour group from a Christian school. This made him very agitated. Later he went on deck and asked the captain of the boat angrily, "Where can I go to avoid these accursed Christians?" The captain was not a good man either. He answered sharply, "The only place is hell." This word pierced the young man's heart deeply. Soon after this, he became a Christian.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FINAL PRAYER</H2><P>The bishop of England was a faithful worker of the Lord. He labored day and night. On his deathbed he prayed, "Lord, forgive me for my sin of negligence!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IMMEDIATE EFFECT</H2><P>The Keswick Convention in England is the top among all spiritual conferences in the world. It has been preaching sanctification, consecration, and victory for over half a century. Dr. Meyer, who has been to China before, was conducting one of these convention meetings. At the beginning of the meetings, he told the congregation, "If you have any overdue debts at home, you cannot expect to have God's blessings this time." The next day, the money orders at the post office were all sold out.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LOCK BEING ON THIS SIDE</H2><P>Once a man met a preacher on the streets of London. He said to the preacher, "When I was in Paris, I heard your preaching, and I can still remember it. At that time, I heard the message and repented and believed in God." The preacher asked what he had heard. The man said, "You said that `the lock is on our side.' I had always thought that God was cruel and that I had to do good before I could please Him. When I heard your word, I had a fresh realization, and I knew that the Lord Jesus was waiting for me to receive Him. If the Lord Jesus is not in my heart, the fault is with me." John 5:40 says, "Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 13 and 14</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHY MANNA CAME DAILY</H2><P>A certain king only saw his son once a year at the appointed time when the son came for his supply and money. In order that the father could see the son every day and be near to him and have fellowship with him, the father changed the meeting time to once a day. This is how our heavenly Father feels toward us. Therefore, we should come to the Father's throne of grace every day and ask Him to "give us today our daily bread" (Matt. 6:11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN WESLEY'S FAITH</H2><P>Wesley once said, "When I first began to preach, I encountered many difficulties. My brother Charles many times said, `If the Lord would give me wings, I would fly away.' I always answered, `If the Lord wanted me to fly, He would certainly give me wings.'" "Fear ye not" (Exo. 14:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A SERMON THAT WAS NEVER DELIVERED</H2><P>A certain renowned professor at a university was very much admired by many people. One day he was sitting in his study. On his desk were many books, but the Bible was not among them. He was invited to speak at the university cathedral on the upcoming Sunday, and he was preparing for his sermon. He knew that many people would listen to his speaking, and the chancellor, the professors, and a few hundred students would be there. The famous professional people and merchants would also come to listen to him. The Sunday morning service at that cathedral, being famous for always having good music, was always well-attended by socially renowned persons. This being the case, the professor thought that he must do the best job possible, for he realized that his name was quite well-known also. A few of his colleagues had spoken there before and had been severely criticized. He could not afford to commit the same mistakes as they did. He had to say something new and timely. He was obviously trying to earn the praise of men instead of the praise of God.</P><P>He put his head in his hands and muttered quietly to himself. In the end, he exclaimed, "I have it!" and he took a piece of paper and wrote on it, "New Trends in Thinking." He said, "This will be my theme-New Trends in Thinking." Two weeks before that, another preacher had preached there. He was known as a fundamentalist, and what he spoke was mocked by others. The young men and women called him an "antiquity." Now that this professor was going to preach on new trends in thinking, he found this a chance to respond to what the other preacher had spoken. He knew that his audience would love to listen to such words.</P><P>Now he had to consider a little what he was going to say. But he needed one verse. According to the custom of the place, he must choose one Scripture verse to serve as the basis for the Sunday morning service. What verse should he choose? In the end, he chose Acts 17:19. "And they took hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is which is being spoken by you?" He said to himself, "Fortunately there is such a verse. I can take this opportunity to show them my knowledge concerning Greek history and language." He hurriedly wrote something down. After he had jotted something down concerning the Areopagus and Greek philosophy, he proceeded to write the first section of his sermon, "Old Concepts." He wrote, "There are some old concepts in religion that cannot stand in the eyes of modern scientific research. What our ancestors believed in is too old and antiquated. If the great ancient theologians were to come back to life today, they would give up their faith and agree with our new thoughts also." But what are the old concepts that he had to speak about? Here he thought he had a chance to rebut the word of the preacher who had spoken earlier. He wanted to find some points of faith from the unerring Book that he could make a mockery of. He wrote, "There is nothing in this world that is infallible. The word infallible means perfect, and it is impossible to be perfect. There is no book in this world that contains no mistakes, there is no truth in this world that can be unerring, and there is no one in this world who can be without error. Even Christ was not without error; He made some mistakes also." Then he proceeded, "The virgin birth of Jesus is a belief that cannot be explained by science. Neither is there any historical record concerning it. It is merely an unfounded story. As to resurrection, such a belief is rejected by great writers and scientists alike. All those with enlightened minds will no doubt understand Jesus' resurrection to be not a resurrection of the person, but a resurgence of His conduct, His personality, His guidance, and His pattern. The old concepts speak of a heaven and a place of suffering (hell) after death. This belief is quite illogical also. We do not know about our future. It is possible that after death there is a future life, but it may not be a kind of future life like that described in the Bible. We can never be certain of this."</P><P>What we have quoted was the first section of his sermon. Now he proceeded on to the second section, "The New Concepts." He said, "We are like the ancient Greeks, always seeking for the new things, and we are still in the process of seeking." He was coming to the subject of evolutionary theology, and he was writing faster and faster.</P><P>While he was writing, suddenly two little arms embraced his neck. They were the arms of his only daughter, who was eleven years old. She had entered the study without her father noticing. She said, "Daddy, the meal is ready. Mother has called you three times. We thought you had fallen asleep."</P><P>The man pointed to his papers and said, "No, I have not fallen asleep. I am very busy. Do you know that your daddy is going to preach next Sunday in the big cathedral?"</P><P>While he was taking his meal, he spent the whole time talking about his sermon, and he told everyone how he came up with the theme. He also told them how he would spend the whole afternoon and evening writing his sermon. At that time, his daughter said, "But Daddy, you promised me that this afternoon you would take me to the top of the hill. What about it? Please take me there!" He shook his head, saying, "I am afraid that you have to wait until the following week after I have finished my sermon. What a pity that this is Wednesday already. Other than the time I spend on lecturing, I will have to spend all my time to prepare my sermon." The daughter was disappointed, and she was about to cry. The mother comforted her and told her that her father would surely take her to the hill the following Monday and would walk with her in the cemetery on the hill. There was also a cottage of an old farmer there.</P><P>That afternoon, the professor was busy writing. By midnight, he was still correcting his wordings over and over. Later he said, "Finally, I put the whole thing in order. Tomorrow, the day after, and Saturday, I will spend some time to read over it again and again." After he said this, he went to his bedroom beside his study to sleep.</P><P>The second morning, his wife came in earlier than usual and told him that his daughter did not sleep well the night before, that she had a fever, and that she was afraid that it was a kind of gallbladder disease. The mother gave the girl some medicine she had taken before. The father went to look at the child. The girl said, "Daddy, if you had taken me to the hilltop, to the cemetery and the farmer's house, I would not have become sick this morning." He kissed his daughter and said, "Next week I will surely take you there."</P><P>He went back to his study and busied himself with his new thoughts-his sermon. He had to go to a class at 2:00 in the afternoon; hence, he wanted to spend all his time on his sermon. At about noon, his wife knocked on the door and came in, saying, "I don't want to bother you, but Clara (the girl's name) seems to be very sick. She has a fever of 103 degrees. She kept talking about the hilltop. She is no longer conscious." He tried to call for the doctor to come right away. After lunch the doctor came, and he said that the sickness was very serious. Her fever was high, and her throat was burning. In the evening the doctor came again, and the child grew worse. He thought that the child had diphtheria, and he gave her a shot. The child was weak, and the fever did not go away. The parents watched her anxiously. The father went frequently to his study to kneel before the desk, on which lay his sermon, and cried out with tears, "O God, if You answer prayers, please save my child, my only child, Clara."</P><P>The next morning, the doctor came to visit them early. As soon as he saw the child, he was disappointed because the child had become worse. He asked a few other doctors to join him. The child breathed heavily and spoke hysterically, "Daddy, the hilltop." The doctors were all sober-faced. They decided that they should stay there for a few more hours.</P><P>The professor returned to his study. He wanted to pray, but could not do so. After an hour an older doctor, a Christian, came and knocked on his study door. The professor went over to open the door, and asked, "Doctor, how is she? Did she respond to the treatment? Will she recover?" The old man looked at him without saying anything, then bowed down his head. In the end he said, "Professor, come and see her lovely face. She has gone to a better place. To Christians, that is a better place." Before the word ended, the two were in the bedroom. The child was lying there with her eyes closed and her pale face smiling. The child had died.</P><P>The sad news spread quickly. A few students of the professor were sincere Christians. In the evening they gathered under the window of the professor's study and sang softly:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;<br>The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!<br>When other helpers fail and comforts flee,<br>Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.<br><br>Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;<br>Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;<br>Change and decay in all around I see;<br>O Thou who changest not, abide with me.</P><P>They did not know that the professor was sitting by his desk. His sermon was laid aside, and all his reference books were on the shelf. In his hand was a Bible. Randomly, he turned to a page. At that time his eyes were filled with tears. It read: "Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me. In My Father's house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be" (John 14:1-3).</P><P>At this time, while he was sobbing softly, he heard the singing outside:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>I need Thy presence every passing hour:<br>What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?<br>Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?<br>Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.<br><br>I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:<br>Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:<br>Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?<br>I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.</P><P>He turned to his Bible again and read, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and every one who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever. Do you believe this?" (John 11:25-26). He said with a trembling voice, "Lord, I believe." His eyes were immediately opened to see the vanity of the "New Trends in Thinking." In the depths of his heart, he realized that such thoughts gave him no hope and no comfort. What he believed in did not give him any life, power, or hope. In his time of sorrow, they could not render him any help. He knelt down to pray. Oh, what a prayer it was! He confessed his sins and committed himself into the bosom of his Lord.</P><P>On Monday they went up to the hilltop. The coffin of the child was covered with white flowers. The coffin was carried by four of the professors. The preacher read the Bible: "For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep; because the Lord Himself, with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words" (1 Thes. 4:15-18).</P><P>After the coffin was lowered into the grave, the father stepped forth and spoke loudly to everyone, with his head bowed: "Friends, the child whom I loved has died. She is with the Lord who died for her. Before this open grave, I want to confess that this Lord is my Savior. The Lord left the heavenly glory to come to earth to die for our sins. He was buried and resurrected on the third day. He will still come back again to receive us unto His glorious self. By that time, my child will be back in my arms. This faith is what I have often denied before you, my students and colleagues. Now it is the only faith that will give me peace and hope."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 22</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WIND BLOWING</H2><P>One day by a river, a man was angrily tearing apart a tract that another person had given to him, and he was throwing it into the river. The amazing thing was that the wind blew a piece of the shredded paper back into his sleeve. The torn piece had only one word: "Eternity." The man was immediately reminded by the word, and he was awakened to his own ungodliness. It turned him to "seek Jehovah while He may be found; / Call upon Him while He is near" (Isa. 55:6). Indeed, "the wind blows where it wills" (John 3:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE VICTORY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THROUGH THE DEFEAT OF AN AGNOSTIC</H2><P>A certain man was an educated and polite person. Yet he was an agnostic. Whatever he felt in his heart, he would not show it outwardly. He traveled to many places and visited many of his relatives. Among one of his relatives was his widowed aunt who was a Christian. She invited this man to her house very often, and she was grieved about his attitude toward the Bible.</P><P>One day I received an invitation card from her to speak with her nephew over dinner about his unbelieving concepts. She and her daughters had debated this matter with him already, and the poor women were not able to answer him. I gladly went. At the table this man sat opposite to me. Soon, he looked at me with a smile and said, "Do you believe in the story of the flood?" I said, "I believe in every word of it." He said, "In this matter, your God shows that He is a demon that destroys humanity." I said, "On the contrary, He was saving men by destroying them. This proves His wisdom and His goodness." He said, "You can never convince me in this matter." I said, "Don't say such a thing with too much assurance. You are a doctor. If you observe that I have a deadly disease in my arm and you tell me to have my arm cut off, would you say that you are doing what a demon does? The proportion of the number of men at the time of flood to the whole of humanity is much smaller than the size of the arm to the whole body. The difference in the spiritual sphere does not change the principle. Furthermore, in order to cut off an arm, a person must cut off the hand and the fingers as well. When a man corrupts himself, he corrupts his family as well. Take the example of a drunkard: the arm can be likened to the man, the hand can be likened to the wife, and the fingers, to the children. Are you a demon just because you cut off my arm?" He answered, "Certainly not." I said, "What more then can you say?" He humbly acknowledged his defeat, yet followed immediately by saying, "If you believe in the foreknowledge of God concerning man's suffering, you can never justify God's act in His creation of man." I said, "You are wrong again. This act has to do with His gift of life. It proves God's goodness and wisdom." He said, "This is impossible." I said, "Not so. Suppose we are twins, and our father promises that when we grow up, he will give us fifty thousand pounds each. Suppose he knows beforehand that I will waste my portion and that you will increase your portion. Should the fact that I will bring loss to myself cause you to be deprived of your joy?" He said, "That is right. One cannot do this." I said, "In this matter, you have to acknowledge that God's goodness and wisdom are manifested in the creation of man." He began to show admiration and awakening, and he readily acknowledged my argument. But he insisted that it was wrong that man should be given a free will, and that such an act was indefensible.</P><P>I said, "This is again something that manifests God's goodness and wisdom. You are an unmarried man. Suppose you are to be married, and you have to choose between two women. One of them does not have any will. The other has a will, but in everything she is contrary to your will. Which of the two would you choose?" He said, "Of course, the one with a will. The other must be a piece of clay!"</P><P>All the lady relatives applauded and were happy at his judgment, and the doctor did not say anything more.</P><P>Later, we became good friends, and he was no longer an agnostic. He openly confessed that he believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, and he matched his faith by his Christian deeds.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD USING THE HUMBLE ONES</H2><P>One town in our province was famous for being evil. The tide of sin swept through that place, and the small number of Christians there felt unable to stand firm. One summer there was an evangelistic tent meeting nearby. Among the repentant ones was an illiterate called "the Fool." He attended the meeting out of curiosity, but was wonderfully saved by the Lord. When he returned to his sin-ridden town, his heart was pounding within him. He went from house to house and went in without knocking, threatening the people with a loud voice: "What will you do when eternity comes?"</P><P>He did his best from street to street. He said nothing else except, "When eternity comes, what are you going to do?" The arrows of condemnation were shooting fast and quick. The people were reminded of God and were sorrowful. The few Christians in that town were encouraged by their newly converted comrade, and they came alive. They invited a preacher to their town, and following that, there was a great revival and much reaping of souls. As the preacher recalled it, the filthy, sinful society was renewed. A church was built, and a great congregation with a Sunday school was established. All these things happened because of one heavenly messenger who came with the word, "When eternity comes, what will you do?" This resulted in waking everyone out of his dreams.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A DRUNKARD'S WILL</H2><P>The following is a drunkard's will which was found on a chair in his room after he had committed suicide. It concerns a very sober and tragic matter: "What I am leaving to the world is a detestable character and corrupted example. What I am leaving to my parents is unbearable sorrow in their failing age. What I am leaving to my brothers and sisters is my extreme shame and dishonor. What I am leaving to my wife is a broken heart and a shameful life. What I am leaving to every one of my children is poverty, illiteracy, poor character, and the memory of a father lying in a drunkard's tomb, going into a drunkard's hell."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SAFE IN THE ARMS OF JESUS</H2><P>One day, two sisters were playing and singing, "Safe in the arms of Jesus." The older sister asked the younger one, "How do you know that you are safe?" The younger one answered, "When my hands are holding the Lord's hand, I know that I am safe." The older sister said, "What if Satan comes to snatch you away from the Lord's hand? How can you still be safe?" The younger one changed her countenance, and she thought for a long time. Then she said, "Oh, I was wrong. It is the Lord's hand that is holding my hands. Satan cannot snatch from His hands. Therefore I am safe." Jesus said, "No one shall snatch them out of My hand" (John 10:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MISSING THE TRAIN BUT GAINING CHRIST</H2><P>It was nine o'clock in the morning. The 8:50 train had paused and left the beautiful station after all the passengers had boarded. One old stationmaster had been working in the company for many years. After the exciting activity of the last train, he lay back to rest for an hour in front of the little garden filled with flowers. This was his reward for his hard work.</P><P>Suddenly there were some rapid footsteps followed by a man rushing in. His anger could as easily be detected as the redness on his face. Though his impatience and annoyance made him somewhat short of words, he was nevertheless harshly rebuking the driver for the latter's negligence in waking him up to catch the train. "I was willing to pay you twenty-five dollars; I did not want to see myself missing the train. What should I do now?"</P><P>Of course, under such circumstances the only proper thing to do was to wait quietly for the ten o'clock train to arrive. But the poor man was not yet resolved in his mind as to what to do.</P><P>The stationmaster was a kind and diligent person. He had met such cases many times before, and he knew what to do. He said, "The best thing to do is to leave him alone, because soon he will recover." Therefore, he patiently waited, until the pace of the man's walking on the platform slowed down.</P><P>Then he spoke up, "Sir, here is a comfortable waiting room. Would you care to come in and sit down?" The man turned and followed him into the small and cozy room. Outside the window were some climbing roses, and the air was clean. In the midst of the room was a round table with many tracts. These were little God-sent messengers for weary travelers. They were all appropriately designed and could easily attract people's attention. The passenger was happy to have something to do while he was waiting. He flipped through the tracts, picked up one of them, sat down, and began to read it. By that time, the stationmaster had returned to his little garden.</P><P>He thought to himself, "What a quiet day!" A little later he looked up at the clock and realized that the next train was about to come. Some passengers had arrived, and the ticket booth had opened, and they were waiting for the next train to come. The first passenger was still sitting in the waiting room reading the tract. It was a long article, and he was fully absorbed in what it said, to the extent that he had forgotten the time. The stationmaster said, "Sir, the train is about to arrive." He jumped up from his chair as one who just woke up from sleep and shouted, "The train is coming. Will you sell this tract to me? I want to finish it." "Sir, you can take it with you. I am more than happy for you to keep it. A kind lady gave these to me, and I am sure she would be happy for you to have it." "Thank you, and please thank her for me." A minute later, the man was on the train.</P><P>One month later, the stationmaster was on the same platform. When the train stopped, a passenger jumped out of the train car and stood in front of him. He stretched out his hand and said, "Do you recognize me?" "Sir, I still recognize you. You are the frustrated person who missed the train a few weeks ago."</P><P>"I could have avoided that. But that morning though I missed the train, I gained the Savior. How wonderful was that tract! Previously, I was always busy with my business, and I had no time to think about God or read any book about God. But I could not avoid the serious questions posed by the tract. I wish I could have the time to tell you everything. But you can tell the lady who gave you the tracts that they have led me to the Lord Jesus, and I have done my best to buy and give away many tracts to others. I have never experienced greater joy."</P><P>The sound of the train whistle interrupted their conversation. The old stationmaster was happy at heart when he saw the train slowly leaving the station with one passenger glowing with joy. "One new creation created in Christ Jesus!"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING FILLED THROUGH WORKING FOR THE LORD</H2><P>One zealous but poor believer always attended the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord's Day. She always brought her friends and relatives along to listen to the sermon, and her face was always filled with unspeakable joy. When her friends and relatives met her, they always said, "You must have struck a fortune after you became a believer! Before, you worked seven days a week, but were still short of your daily supply. Now you do not work on Sunday, yet you still have enough to live on! Probably you have struck some fortune!" She answered with a smile, "I do not have any riches in this world. But I have received the heavenly inheritance and exhaustless treasures in heaven. I still have to work to earn my living. But every Lord's Day, I stop my work for the Lord's sake and consecrate the Lord's Day to the Lord. On Sunday I am busy attending meetings for breaking bread and busy attending services; I am busy inviting people to come and busy testifying to others. It does not mean that I can earn my living without working. But when I am so busy working for the Lord, my stomach is filled already." The Bible says, "If anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat" (2 Thes. 3:10). The Lord Jesus said, "I have food to eat...My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work" (John 4:32, 34).</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3, January 1926<br>(Edited from Newspapers in the West)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALMOST SIX THOUSAND YEARS</H2><P>Strictly speaking, there is, of course, no proof that the millennium will begin at the end of six thousand years of human history. However, there are many proofs that the millennium is the Sabbath day of all the millenniums and the reality of the jubilee.</P><P>We are now approaching the end of the six thousand years. According to the "creation calendar," by September 18 this year the Jews will have reached the 5,686th year of their calendar, only 314 years short of six thousand years. This is only a little over three centuries. Mr. Martin Anstey of the former London Missionary Society once did an even more accurate and scriptural calculation. If we consider his calculation, we will become more clear. He reckoned that from the year Adam was created, which was roughly the beginning of the "creation calendar," until today, there are 5,967 and one-third years, being thirty-two and two-thirds years short of six thousand years. This is only a little over thirty years from the end.</P><P>This is quite similar to the period that our Lord worked on the earth, about thirty-three years. Although the time was short, how powerful and meaningful those years were!</P><P>This age is about to end! The rapture can happen at any time! May the power of God operate more in the lives of the consecrated ones to perform selfless works and to save the perishing ones!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WEATHER FORECAST FOR 1926 to 1927</H2><P>On July 25 the famous Saturday Evening Post wrote,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Dr. H. H. Clayton with other observers, in conjunction with the observatories of North and South America of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., predicted the nature of the upcoming weather.....Dr. Abbot noted that the result obtained recently was specific and exciting....The issue that the scientists are most interested in is the forecast of the weather for 1926 to 1927. This will be the period when the sun spots will be the highest, that is, when the activity of the sun will be the greatest. According to Mr....and other observers of the new science, these two years will be the most dangerous years, and the weather will affect the crops throughout the world. The notable thing is that 1926 to 1927 will be the second time after the "summerless year" of 1816 when the activity of the sun is the greatest.</P><P>Every 270 to 275 years the whole earth experiences abnormal weather. 1926 to 1927 will be the sixth 271-year cycle after the famine of the Roman Empire at the time of Diocletian (A.D. 299-300). This period is also the 1,372nd year of the Chinese historian in which there will be the forty-eighth cycle of the blackening out of the sun.</P><P>According to an editorial of the U.S. magazine Awake, the weather forecast in the U.S. this year gives enough signs. During the summer of 1925, there were snow and hailstorms in northwestern U.S., and the temperature was very cold. In other parts of California there were abnormal storms and rain, and after the rain and the storms there were hailstorms. Although we cannot predict the weather for 1926 to 1927, we can say for sure that the age we are in is indeed a dangerous age. We will note the fact for now and will observe how things are going to develop. "In the last days difficult times will come" (2 Tim. 3:1).</P><P>Another news item from London on December 19, 1921, said,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>1926 will be a year that shakes the foundation of the world material supply and world politics. Pestilence, famine, floods, shipwrecks, looting, and revolutions will be frequent during this year. This is predicted by the British astro-magazine. This year Mars and Mercury will line up. According to that magazine, six years after this, the battle of Armageddon will begin. This will be the final battle between the Muslims with the Communists, and the Anglo-Saxons. After 1932, there will be world peace. But perhaps there will be few of us left. By that time, we will be so worn out that we will be forced to make peace. This is the prediction that the astrologists predicted for this year.</P><P>How interesting this article is! These are words uttered by worldly people. Although we cannot believe all that they said, we know that the end is near.</P><P>On August 5, 1922, the Christian Missionary Alliance Weekly quoted Mr. Panton, the renowned writer on prophecy:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1> Concerning the imminent approach of hell, I can relate the following story:<br>A captain in the British army was feasting once in 1911 in Cairo, Egypt. He met an Indian magician who told him that there would be a terrible war in Europe in the first week of August 1914. In December of 1919 he met the same Indian, who said, "Captain, what did I tell you? In 1911, the telepathists in India and Tibet had already seen the things that were about to happen." The captain asked, "What about peace?" The magician answered, "This will not be a peace, but merely a prolonged armistice." The captain asked, "What will happen?" He answered, "In the year 1927, no sooner or later, there will be a great war. The present war is but child's play in comparison to that coming one."</P><P>From all these reports, we can see that the years 1926 and 1927 will be extraordinary years. We cannot say in which year the Lord Jesus will rapture His overcoming believers. But one thing we can say: the time is near. We cannot take everything that the worldly people say as being true, but undoubtedly, we are living in an extraordinary age. I (the editor), for one, hope that the Lord will come this year! May those who love the Lord's appearing pray that the time for God's Son to appear will come quickly, so that we can see our beloved Lord. (Note: The reason we quoted all the newspapers is not to ascertain the date of the Lord's return, but to show that the time is near.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ANTICHRIST APPROACHING?</H2><P>The students of prophecy know that before Christ will appear on earth, Antichrist will appear. He will be one of the Roman Emperors revived. Please read 2 Thessalonians 2 for this. For now we can take a look at the signs. On May 30, 1925, the President of the United States, Mr. Coolidge, spoke on Memorial Day, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Our nation is based on the ideal of local self-rule...We have to admit that the recent tendency is contrary to this spirit. Individuals are no longer building their own freedom through self-rule and labor...but have committed the responsibility of prosperity and moral virtue to the intoxicating influence that pervades society. In the same way, the local governments are looking to the state governments, and the state governments are looking to the national government, while the national governments are looking to a nebulous organization, a flimsy union to pay their debts and to tell them what they should do. This is not self-rule...If we allow others to help us, we cannot stop others from controlling us. If we are too weak to uphold our own morality, we will not be strong enough to uphold our freedom. If we cannot rule ourselves, if we cannot abide by the law, there will be no way except for others to control us, to subjugate us under the law, and to lower our noble and free position to that of a shameful slave." </P><P>From this speech of President Coolidge, we can see that America and the world cannot rule themselves. According to his mature political view, the world must be under someone's domination. Hence, the world is ripe for Antichrist to execute his autocratic regime. While standing on the watchtower of prophecy, we can see that men are becoming more and more lawless, until the day the lawless one appears, when they will all be subject under his hand. Antichrist is coming soon! But before he appears, the saints will be raptured! Be watchful! Let us consider more words from others.</P><P>Mr. Mussolini of Italy, where Rome is situated, has challenged the world to pay attention to his declaration. Although he may not be one of the Roman emperors revived, he is at least a type of that emperor. He said on August 18, "I believe there is no such thing as freedom in this world. Freedom is but something in the ideal of the philosophers; it is the impractical philosophy that comes from the air. Our philosophy comes from the earth that is so near to us and is for those living on earth. Civilization is the opposite of freedom...The crowd cannot rule over the crowd, and the majority cannot rule over the majority." Concerning Caesar, the Roman emperor, Mussolini said, "He is our ideal person, our master. Julius Caesar was the greatest man on earth." Concerning the condition in Europe, he said, "Europe is impregnated with life. This old continent is not corrupted...If Europe has become old, then Italy should have been the weakest, for it is the oldest of all the European countries. But Italy is very strong, and there is nothing that can stop its progress." Do not the speeches of President Coolidge and Mussolini point to the same thing? Do they not all point to a coming authoritarian world king? "At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established" (2 Cor. 13:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SECRET CHRIST</H2><P>It is said that there are many in the Muslim countries who believe in Christ in secret. They gather together in a central location of a certain city, break bread in closed rooms, and communicate with each other through secret signs. Among them, seventeen said that they have seen Christ appearing to them in their secret meetings behind closed doors.</P><P>News from Russia also reported that Christ appeared once to a shepherd boy and warned him of the end time of this age. As a result, seventeen thousand big wooden crosses were erected on the Russian farms. This proves that many people believe in this report.</P><P>Last month the editor of this paper met Dr. Wong of the Amoy Salvation Hospital, who told us of a strange story in a certain house in Tsanghai of Amoy. I have heard of this story before, but not with so much detail. There appeared to be a voice that came from the ceiling of that house, which was supposedly the voice of the deceased Pastor Lin. The voice would identify himself as the voice of Pastor Lin and would warn the people in the house on behalf of God. All that the voice spoke was Scripture verses. This strange story goes into much detail, and we cannot relate all the details here. The voice has been there on and off for over a year, and there have been many believers who have gone there to inquire of the voice. My friend Wang Teng-ming asked Dr. Wong to test the voice with 1 John 4:2. After Dr. Wong asked the question, the voice was silent for half an hour, after which it said, "Read 1 Corinthians 13:13!" It was not an answer to the question. But the believers in that place still believed that the voice was genuine and considered the teaching of 1 Corinthians 13:13 to be an answer. Not only did they say that they heard the voice; they claimed that they had once seen a form and had seen glory shining in the sky for an hour and a half.</P><P>This is clearly the false work of the evil spirits, because (1) the dead believers are now in paradise and cannot come out of it, (2) the Lord never asks dead people to preach to the living, (3) the Lord forbids the dead to communicate with the living and would, therefore, never send a dead person back to life, and (4) this voice did not acknowledge that the Lord Jesus had come in the flesh. His silence means that he did not acknowledge the fact. All the other ambiguous answers do not count. Yet why did the voice teach others to do good? Please read Acts 16:16-18. There the demons were preaching for the Lord and were telling others about the works of God's servants! When the devil tempted the Lord Jesus, he quoted Scriptures as well. Moreover, the things with which he tempted the Lord were not sin in man's eyes. Yet those things are not God's will. Therefore, this demon from Tsanghai came from Satan and was there to deceive men.</P><P>At the end time, Satan is using all kinds of schemes to pave the way for his Antichrist, so that when he comes, there will be no hindrance at all.</P><P>"Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it" (Matt. 24:26). God's command is: "Do not believe every spirit, but prove..." (1 John 4:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REVIVAL OF ROME</H2><P>Around September 1925, the government in Rome was changed from self-rule to national-rule. The correspondent in Rome of the British Morning Post (August 25, 1925) said, "This is a necessary step for the renewed expansion of Caesar's city." This is an ominous sign. At present, anyone or any newspaper in Italy who criticizes the Roman Catholic Church or its creeds will be condemned. The official paper of Mussolini recently published an amazing article that praised the Inquisition as being flawless. This article talked about the "wild principle" of Protestantism and continued by saying that "the interrogation of the heretics, the tortures, and the murders are the greatest acts for the glory of God to us." The massacre of the Huguenots in France was considered as being very praiseworthy. The Christian World on August 20, 1925, said, "The position of the Protestants in Italy can be in peril any moment. What kind of omen is this?" The students of prophecy decades ago were able to answer this question already. Before the Roman Catholic Church will be judged (Rev. 17:1), it will first be drunk with the blood of the martyrs (v. 6). The thoughtful observers are beginning to worry. One of the professors of theology at King's College in London, Dr. Maurice Relton, said, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In the twentieth century, Rome demands the authority of decision-making and of authoritarianism in the same way as it did before. Can we deal with this problem, or should we simply restrict ourselves to being Anglican Church members? If we can deal with this problem, there may still be hope. Otherwise, we know for sure that in the near future, there will be nothing except confusion. In the more distant future, it will probably not be Canterbury (where the Anglican bishop resides) or Geneva (where the League of Nations is) that will prevail, but Rome, the enemy of the two, who will prevail.</P><P>Those of us who study prophecy know already that the Roman Empire and the Roman Church will be revived. This will fulfill the prophecy in the books of Daniel and Revelation. Considering the present condition, we realize that the great tribulation is at hand. Therefore, we will not remain guests on earth for too long.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMING GREAT WAR</H2><P>A famous British writer recently declared that unless God intervenes with miracles, mankind will sink into unprecedented tribulations. The reason for this is that science, which used to be devoted to constructive works, is now devoted specifically to means of destruction. Although at no other time in history has there been as much advance in science in preservation and healing, with the goal of improving the material comfort of mankind and the bestowing of temporary blessings, at the same time, many believe that the advance of science on the negative side is even faster. Many shocking facts can testify to this. The following facts are recorded by Mr. Panton in his magazine, Dawn:</P><P>"The machine gun fires six thousand rounds of bullets per minute in a fan-like fashion."</P><P>"The airplane can fly to a height of a few dozen miles and drop bombs that are over 4,300 pounds, killing everyone within a radius of one mile."</P><P>"The fast gun has a shooting range of 450 miles."</P><P>"The tank can camouflage its smoke and is faster than the fastest hunting hound."</P><P>"All these things are here already!"</P><P>All of us have heard of the so-called "death ray," which can paralyze life forty miles away for more than six hours from over forty-five thousand feet high. Recently, there is another new invention called "death stroke," which some called man-made lightning. The inventor says that the "death stroke" can kill a person twenty miles away, and that he has killed many animals with this "death stroke" in the desert within a radius of seven miles. The coming great war will give no peace to mankind!</P><P>The Manchester Conservative paper said, "If destructive science is still in control, there will be no cure for the world...It is doubtless that the destructive forces are stronger than the creating and constructive forces."</P><P>David Lloyd George, four times British Prime Minister, said, "If we have another war, with the destructive means that we have that were unavailable in previous wars...the world will sink into a condition that goes far beyond the most perilous time in the past."</P><P>The Norwegian scientist Mr. Vogt said, "Give me a few million pounds, and I can destroy the whole of Berlin." Edison said, "Nothing can stop twenty to fifty airplanes from flying to London tomorrow and killing millions of people in three minutes with a certain kind of gas."</P><P>Then there is racial strife. "The present world is in a condition of unprecedented fermentation. Prior to this, eighty to ninety percent of the world's populated areas were under the white people's domination." Mr. Panton said, "Suddenly (1 Thes. 5:3), we are brought face to face with racial strife." Dr. S. P. Cadman said, "This coming war will forever remove the superiority of the white people." On June 30, 1925, the Thames Paper reported, "Moscow (Russia) encourages the yellow and black people to shake themselves from the domination of the white people. The struggle between races is no longer a distant dream on this little planet, but a shocking matter in the near future." Consider again the present anti-foreigner sentiment in China. We cannot help but think that racial wars are close at hand. The subjugation of the minority races by the white race has been a known fact. It is true that where there is discontent, there are outcries. But even if the yellow and the black people are to gain supremacy in the future, there is still no rationale behind it! Those who have not received the Lord's salvation and who have not been regenerated can never treat others with justice. This is not what we are talking about here. After reading what we have quoted, we can see that the coming war is inevitable. The pacifists can go on with their peace campaign, while the warmongers can go on with their war preparations. The day of the Lord is truly at hand. "For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom...All these things are the beginning of birth pangs" (Matt. 24:7-8).</P><P>In considering the world situation, we realize that we are truly at the end time. The world has become too evil, and it is no longer worthy of our living here. The armies of hell seem to be mobilized and are very active. This is what we know: either we will be raptured, or we will be martyred. The suffering of those who love the Lord will be increased. From now on, there will no longer be any comfortable times. However, we should not "be troubled," because our eyes are heavenward. We look up to the heavens! But as long as we are on earth, we should be the salt. If the earth becomes corrupted, it is because the salt has lost its taste. This is why we have to be faithful and watchful, and we should pray. May the Lord preserve us in this perilous age.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5, March 1926</H2><P>(Editor's note: This column considers world events from the scriptural view. It is for the purpose of showing the imminent return of the Lord, and not for ascertaining the date of His return.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES</H2><P>Last summer the World Council of Churches called a conference in the capital of Sweden. If I remember correctly, China also sent representatives to the conference. The main organizers of the conference were so-called modernists. At the end of the conference, they issued a declaration which, though it mentioned the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, did not tell what the truth of the gospel is! The purpose of the conference was to unite all the churches of the world. Yet the conference did not affirm what we believe in. Cardinal doctrines such as the inspiration of the Bible, the virgin birth, the vicarious death for redemption, the gospel of the shedding of the blood, and the physical resurrection were, according to my knowledge, not mentioned at all. If some would mention these things, others in the meeting would ask them to sit down! Let us quote a portion of their declaration:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1> We are indeed thankful for the opportunity at this time to have so many churches to come together, to love one another, to exercise restraint, and to discuss many problems selflessly. We have seen the gospel of Christ practiced in the many facets of the human life, in commerce, in society, in politics, and in the urgent needs of the international community. In economics, we realize that the highest of all pursuits is in spiritual things, which should not be considered as less important than material things and the mechanization of industry. This is why we demand that spiritual things be given the highest right, the right to be helped. For this reason we are fighting for a free and full development of human rights.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In the name of the gospel, we attest to the fact that industrialization should not be for individual gains, but should be a service to society...There should be cooperation in place of mutual competition, so that capitalists and laborers can have industrialization as the common goal.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>We went on to discuss moral and social problems, such as over-population, unemployment, decline of morality, drinking and its evil, and the cause of lawlessness. In the end we recognized the seriousness of these problems and realized that they cannot be solved by individuals, but must be a responsibility borne by society as a whole.</P><P>What they are saying is in the same principle as what the Society for the Promotion of Christianity says, which is to change the redemptive gospel of the Lord's shed blood to that of a research of problems of industrialization! This means that there is no need for a personal regeneration, and that as long as society is reformed, everything is all right! This is to try to take the Christian principle as leaven and to leaven the whole society! It is to improve this world for the purpose that sinners can live in it forever!</P><P>In these days, everywhere we hear people clamoring for church unity. Babylon the Great of Revelation 17 is about to appear. Alas, what is the use of talking about unity in outward forms if we neglect the scriptural principle? We are seeing the great whore being formed before our eyes. Those who truly love the Lord should come out (Rev. 18:4) and should wait for their rapture.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEXT YEAR'S CONFERENCE</H2><P>Next August a great conference will be held in Lausanne for all the churches in the whole world. All the Protestant churches will send delegates to this conference. This conference was initiated by the Reformed ______ Church in Cincinnati and has been held once every three years since 1910. The goal of this conference is to unite the churches of different countries. First it tries to unite the Protestant churches of all the countries. The Greek Orthodox Church is also helping this movement. There is news that the Roman Catholic Church was asked to join this conference also. In Geneva, Mr. ______ (a modernist) called the Roman Catholic Church "the mother church that includes all churches," and said that there is a "great movement of a return to Roman Catholicism" among the ______. Prior to the European War (World War I), Pope Pius X issued a statement that he was greatly interested in this movement and promised to pray for this movement. He said that for a long time he had hoped for the Protestant churches to be united with the mother church, the Roman Catholic Church.</P><P>In 1919 a delegation was sent to Rome. Pope Benedict XV received these guests courteously and thanked them for coming to him. However, the Pope told them that the Roman Catholic Church could not attend their conference. He said, "I am the descendant of St. Peter, and the representative of Christ. My greatest hope is that there will be one flock, with one shepherd." He referred to the Roman Catholic Church as the one flock, and to himself as the one shepherd! In these days men are trying to negotiate with the Pope again.</P><P>As students of prophecy, we realize that in the future all the churches will be united and will line up behind the Roman Catholic Church. At present, the tendency is already evident. Those who seek after the Lord honestly and who desire to keep the truth must not associate themselves with this movement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NEWS ABOUT THE JEWS</H2><P>(1) A new shipping company: A Jewish Forum Paper said that recently a new organization called the Palestinian Shipping Company has been formed. It has six commercial liners that will travel between New York, Haifa, and the Mediterranean Sea. The director of the company is William Jordan, the chairman of the American Shipping Association. The ships will bear the American flag and the Zionist flag as well.</P><P>(2) The return of the Jews: A certain Jewish organization claimed recently, "During the past six years, we have helped eighty thousand Jews to return to Palestine...They have been redeemed and are now in the work of redeeming many thousands and hundreds of thousands of other people. Because there were over eighty thousand who have migrated to Palestine during the past six years, one thousand Jews were able to leave Poland at one time and join the increasing crowd...Although eighty thousand is only one percent of the total Jewish population in Europe..yet this is only a beginning. Six years ago we could never have imagined that there could be three to four thousand Jews returning to Palestine every month. But now the fact is before our eyes!" The New Palestine News said, "July 21st of last year saw the greatest number of Jews returning from Poland to Palestine in one day. One thousand people migrated on that day to Palestine. In addition, six hundred others were preparing themselves to go." It is said that when they left, there was a big farewell party which expressed their zeal and desire to return to Palestine. All those who returned were filled with joy and satisfaction.</P><P>The London Christian Paper said, "In 1914 there were seventy thousand Jews in Palestine. Today, there are one hundred ten thousand. During the European War, Jews left Palestine by the thousands. Today, not only are the former deserted places filled, but new arrivals are pouring in like a flood...The recent return of the Jews was not only motivated by lofty nationalism, but was a result of the economic and political oppression in their respective countries. Last March, thirty-three hundred returned." Our Hope magazine in America said that within the past month over four thousand Jews returned, and that during the past five years the Jewish population increased by one percent.</P><P>The population of China is so large that we do not consider these numbers very impressive. But to a place as small as the Jewish land, this number is not small. The fig tree has brought forth its shoot, and summer is near!</P><P>(3) The arrival of the new governor: The last governor was ______. The Jewish Forum Paper said that the new governor ______ has arrived in Jerusalem, and that there were a lot of officers at the welcome party that day. The director of Jerusalem affairs ______ first gave a speech in Arabic, which was later translated into Hebrew and English. Mr. ______ followed with a speech in response. The new governor swore his allegiance to the Palestinian Constitution that day.</P><P>(4) The rising cost of land in Palestine: The Hebrew Daily News in Jerusalem reported that buyers of land have increased day by day and were as numerous as the locusts. They based themselves in ______ and were gradually buying land within the city. This caused an upsurge in the price of the land. It is already difficult to secure an inch of land in Tel Aviv. The paper said that the price of land became shockingly high. Another news item reported that at present there are over two hundred thousand acres of land registered under Jewish names.</P><P>(5) Even the Jewish religion is modernized: We know that the Jews are the most conservative of all people. Their faith in the Old Testament is very firm. But now things have greatly changed! Just as some in Christianity have been deceived by Satan and have called themselves modernists, in the same way there are the same kind of people in Judaism. Recently, ______ wrote a book called The Liberated Liberal Judaism. He said that liberated Judaism recognizes the existence of God and the existence of man after death. Yet the book questioned why this kind of faith was not able to gain the heart of the young ones! It said that there is no such thing as a Messianic people. It is said that their tone echoes that of the Trinity Theological Seminary in New York.</P><P>Rabbi ______ thinks that there should be a "simplified Bible." He said that the unessential and repetitious parts should be removed. He also said that "the twentieth century Bible should recognize that divine revelation can be found everywhere in the world, and that the moral teachings of Buddha and Confucius and their deep devotion to God and man, should be included in the Bible, as an example of the brotherhood of all mankind."</P><P>Those who have not been regenerated by the Holy Spirit and who have not experienced the power of the Bible will, of course, consider many parts of the Bible "immaterial, unimportant, and repetitious." But what is it to us who love the truth? The Lord's Word is sweet as honey and precious as gold. How can we remove one word of it? If the Jews who return to their own country are now in such unbelief, no wonder that in the future they will make a covenant with Antichrist and will recognize him as king! Although they are now boasting of their intellectual capacity, from the Scripture we can see their end already!</P><P>The Jewish World said the following concerning the modernistic influence of Zionism and the true belief of Judaism: "The greatest and most urgent need of today is to try our best to plant Jews in Palestine who are proper in their faith. If there are a hundred places like ______ and ______, which are colonies of firm believers in Judaism, it will be of immeasurable value to the development of the proper religion."</P><P>In spite of this, orthodox Judaism does not believe that the Lord Jesus is the Christ! In the future they will also be deceived by Antichrist. We should pray much for the Jews. May the Lord deliver their souls, and may many of their "remnant" be kept in the great tribulation after we have been raptured by the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ROME AND RUSSIA</H2><P>We have long conjectured that "the king of the north" (Dan. 11:28-end) would perhaps come from Russia. But we did not know how the Roman emperor would come to terms with the king of the north. The following fact may shed some light. The Italian dictator Mussolini has sent men to communicate with Russia in private. Although the matter is not yet apparent, and although there are yet many cover-ups, the matter is enough to cast much light on the situation. The Rome correspondent, Mr. ______ of the English Daily News, wrote on September 30, 1925: "Although I need no further proof than what I have already, which proofs for certain reasons I cannot fully reveal yet, since my last report I have received solid evidence of Mussolini communicating with Russia in private. Moscow is now trying its best to bring about a treaty between the two nations." Antichrist is about to appear! Lord, may we be raptured to heaven. Oh, how we desire this day to come soon!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION<br>OF CHRISTIANITY</H2><P>For a number of years, we have been paying attention to the work of the Chinese Society for the Promotion of Christianity. I cannot help but issue warnings to the faithful children of God, so that they would know what to follow. The work of this Society is to prepare the way for the Chinese part of the great Babylon in Revelation 17. This Society does not preach the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. It uses many beautiful spiritual terms to preach another gospel. It is pitiful that some true believers are deceived by it!</P><P>We have received its Christmas issue of the China for Christ magazine, and its publication The Family by the Family Committee. Reading these publications makes a person's heart ache. They say that the Lord Jesus was born to be an example for humanity. In the Christmas issue, not a single word was mentioned about the purpose of the Lord's coming to earth being to die for men and for the saving of men's souls, so that men may be saved from perdition and may receive eternal life. Its Family Committee promotes the so-called "three abstinences," abstinence from prostitution, abstinence from gambling, and abstinence from concubines. The first issue of The Family spoke much about these three things. But not once did it mention the Holy Spirit! Not once did it mention the cross! Can a man be saved by abstaining from prostitution, from gambling, and from having concubines? Are there only these three sins in this world? All these things are done because men do not understand the Bible and do not realize God's power! God says that man can never cause himself to abstain from anything. Everyone in the world is a sinner. Although outwardly a person may be very polished and very clean, nevertheless, this is not inward regeneration, and he is still a man of hell! We thank the Lord that He has sent His Son to die on the cross for our sins and has given us the Holy Spirit, so that we do not have to be condemned, but will have the newness of life and can go to heaven eventually. The ancient gospel is the only one that saves sinners and that removes sins!</P><P>Although these things expose their failure, we have to humble ourselves before God, because such things are done by those who call themselves the church. We should not be proud of ourselves; we should acknowledge our failures before God and should ask God to revive His own church and prepare the little flock who love Him faithfully to be ready for His coming. In these days men pay much attention to the social gospel that never bears any fruit. May God cause us to faithfully preach the gospel that saves sinners by the cross. Brothers, apostasy is increasing day by day, and we must not have a part in the sins of others.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7, May 1926<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHINESE SOCIETY FOR<br>THE PROMOTION OF CHRISTIANITY</H2><P>Because of the danger of the work of this Society, the reporter issued a warning in the fifth issue of this paper. Thank the Lord that many have awakened to the work of this Society. All the works of this Society are for the improvement of society. They do not preach the redemptive gospel of the Lord Jesus. Many officers among them are famous modernists in this country. I do not understand why Bible-believing orthodox churches would support such works that oppose God and would yield to their soft-spoken control. Sometimes they conduct retreats also. But every time I read the report of their retreats, I could not help but sigh. Why did they have to call it a retreat? Why did they not call it a discussion meeting? They use this term with only one intention: to entice average spiritual Christians and to turn them to become their co-workers. What Christianity lacks today is not organizations that are greater and expanded, or discussions that are more refined and more detailed. We have too many of these things already! May the ever-blessed God lead His children to work in a solid way and let the others organize and discuss as much as they please. Before February the editor of the Morning Light Paper wrote me a letter and told me that the church in Chefoo has never joined the Society. When I heard this, on the one hand, I thanked the Lord, and on the other hand, I congratulated the church in Chefoo. Recently I received a letter from a friend in Nanking saying that the China Inland Missions throughout China are also withdrawing from the Society. I also heard that a certain co-worker said that the China Inland Mission is now withdrawing from the Society. Thank the Lord that He has opened the eyes of His children to see that the believing ones and the unbelieving ones have nothing to do with one another. May the Lord lead His faithful servants to leave this Babylonian organization and to serve Him without the camp.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHINESE CHRISTIAN LITERARY SOCIETY</H2><P>The chief figures of this Society are ______ and ______ plus other famous modernists in China. Strictly speaking, the aim of this Society is to overthrow our faith. The fundamental doctrines that we hold as Christians are completely denied by these people. They really belong to another religion; they do not belong to Christianity. We cannot recognize those who do not believe in the inspiration of the Bible or other fundamental doctrines as Christians. This group is now translating the book The Bible for Today by Dr. ______, a noted modernist. I have read this book, and I know that this translation, like all the other books by the same author and published by the Youth Association, will cause untold damage to the faith of many young people. I exhort God's children not to buy books by this publisher nor any magazine by the modernists in the Youth Association. I would further advise others to beware of publications by these organizations. Apostasy is growing day by day, and we should do our best to fight for God's truth. The Lord Jesus is coming soon!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROGRESS IN PALESTINE</H2><P>The population in Palestine, according to a recent survey, has reached one hundred fifty thousand. This is the highest number since the Jews were chastised by God. This proves that the return of the unbelieving Jews to their homeland has become a reality. Their return is a preparation for the end of this age.</P><P>Within the national library of the Jewish state, in the newly built Hebrew University in Jerusalem, there is a gradual increase of valuable books. In Cincinnati a Mr. ______ has donated six thousand volumes of his books. Mr. ______ has also donated five hundred volumes. There are also many valuable ancient manuscripts.</P><P>Jewish women occupy an important place in Palestine, in contrast to the ancient Jewish custom. The recent issue of the women's journal in Jerusalem was printed in Hebrew. This paper is called Ha-Isha, which means The Woman. It is a kind of paper to promote women's suffrage.</P><P>There will be great developments in Jewish industries, commerce, and farming. The Jews have gathered large sums of money for the promotion of these projects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IRON AND CLAY</H2><P>General Pangalos has taken hold of the reins of government in Greece, while Romania and Bulgaria are fast following...France and Germany are rumored to be turning toward nominated government. Even England is inclining toward this age of iron mixed with clay, a difficult match. It is hard to predict the outcome of the present world situation. But when the time comes, He who will come will surely come and will not delay.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE JEWS IN THE HOLY LAND</H2><P>According to a recent report of the Zionists, there are now about one hundred fifty thousand people living in Palestine. Among them twenty-five thousand are farmers, and twenty thousand are laborers. They have introduced commerce and industry, which has been something unknown to this region for more than a few hundred years.</P><P>By their own labor they have built a busy city which has thirty-two thousand inhabitants.</P><P>At present they are developing the commercial port of Haifa and are making it prosperous. They are opening up the ______ Bay, and their farmers are turning the ______ plain into a fertile field. The Jews have also adopted electricity, and places like ______ and ______ have enough electricity to supply light manufacturing work already.</P><P>All these are fulfillments of the Scripture. How we rejoice at seeing God working behind everything for the fulfillment of His purpose.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EGYPT AND PROPHECY</H2><P>Egypt is the center of unrest in the present world. Egypt and England develop conflicts between one another all the time. At the present time, Egypt is still under the control of England. Those who pay attention to the prophecies should pay much attention to the things happening in Egypt. If Daniel 11 is not yet fulfilled, then before the appearing of Antichrist, extraordinary events must take place in Egypt. It will be revived, and it will gather its army to free itself of the British rule, and it will become a strong nation. If this is the case, the present turmoil in Egypt is but a harbinger of the coming events of the last days, and it will hasten the appearance of the coming events. We should pay constant attention to Egypt and Syria.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PREPARING FOR THE APPEARING OF THE ANTICHRIST</H2><P>According to the prophecy in the Bible, the fourth kingdom in the age of the Gentiles will eventually become ten kingdoms and will be ruled by one king. When Rome is revived and is ruled by the last Gentile king, all these prophecies will be fulfilled. This last king will be Antichrist. But how will the ten nations be united together? In the future the northeastern nations of Europe will be united together. Germany, however, will not join this union but will be friendly with the other nations. Russia will at the same time be revived through its turmoils and will become an imperial power. Germany and Russia will be joined together to counteract the allied countries. Their power will reach the East, and they will seize the raw material in the East for their manufacturing industry. China and Japan will join hands with Russia and Germany to counteract the allied countries in an attempt to block them from gaining political and commercial victory in Asia. Hence, the revival of the Roman Empire becomes an indispensable strategy for Europe. The prophecy in Daniel concerning the fourth kingdom will be fulfilled. At present Russia wishes very much to influence the other nations within the boundary of the Roman Empire through its socialistic movements.</P><P>The Jews are developing their finances in Palestine. They have collected thirty million dollars as capital in Jerusalem. The commercial ships travelling between America and Palestine are also collaborating with this work. They will use the mineral wealth of the Dead Sea, estimated to be worth forty billion dollars, for the development of agriculture and the real estate business. The wealth of these people far exceeds the expectation of the economists or the students of prophecy. The Jews in Palestine will become the great bankers of the Middle East. Later, when Palestine is besieged during the Russo-teutonic siege, the accumulated wealth of the Jews will be partly lost (Ezek. 38:10-13).</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 9, July 1926<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HIGHER CRITICISM</H2><P>The German Leipzig Professor Franz Delitzsch is a zealous Christian. He may be considered the greatest Hebrew scholar of his time. Once he warned his students with the following words, "The battle now is around the Old Testament. Soon it will be around the New Testament. The battle has actually begun already. In the end, they will storm the bulwark of your faith-Jesus Christ. The final battle is about to begin. By that time I will not be here any longer, but some of you will still be in the world. I earnestly exhort you to be faithful to the Lord, to stand up for Him, and to preach only Christ and Him crucified. I see the enemy retreating from his strong tower, and I see the bright dawn breaking. In that day our Savior, the King of kings and Lord of lords, will rule forever." This expert's warning is indeed true. The higher critics are doing exactly that very thing. At the beginning they only tried to destroy parts of the Old Testament. After that they tried to destroy the New Testament and now are attacking the Lord Jesus Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SUN SHOWING EXTRAORDINARY SIGNS</H2><P>One famous French astronomer said, "There are extraordinary activities on the surface of the sun. Recently, there have been great and powerful black spots on the surface of the sun. Soon after they are discovered, they disappear again. This has never happened before." The recent earthquakes, the sudden change in weather, and the extraordinary winds and waves are all caused by these black spots. We do not know if these black spots are the beginning of the fulfillment of our Lord's words, "There will be signs in the sun," but we know that following that prophecy in Luke 21:25, it says that there will be anguish upon the earth and roaring of the sea and the billows. Since the astronomers acknowledge that storms and waves are associated with the black spots in the sun, we cannot help but pay attention to these black spots. Revelation 6:12-14 also mentions earthquakes, and the sun becoming black like sackcloth made of hair. The present black spots in the sun may have something to do with these prophecies. At that time, not only will there be wonders on earth, but the heavenly bodies will be shaken as well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REBUILDING OF JERUSALEM</H2><P>Rome is not the only place that will be rebuilt. Reports from the Holy Land have shown that there is now a detailed plan to rebuild Jerusalem. It is said that a certain man has already gone to Palestine to find a certain spot on the Mount of Olives for the rebuilding of the temple. The original site is now occupied by a Muslim mosque and cannot be claimed back. Since the British occupied Palestine, the number of returned Jews has exceeded by a third the number that returned during the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. If Ezra and Nehemiah could use a smaller number to rebuild the city and the temple, it is conceivable that the present rebuilding of the temple and the city can begin very soon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ADVANCE IN PALESTINE</H2><P>During the past few years the Jews have already accumulated more than twenty-seven million dollars of capital in Palestine. Since the European War the returned Jews have reached ninety thousand in number. Hence, there are now more than one hundred fifty thousand people in the Holy Land. The Jews now occupy more than two hundred thousand acres of land. Many of them have been cultivated, and not a few have roads built on them already. Schools are erected, and shops are set up. Since 1920 more than three million trees have been planted. Indeed, Palestine is gradually paving the way for the unbelieving Jews to return, which speaks of the imminence of the great tribulation! "Be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen [the great tribulation] and stand before the Son of Man" (Luke 21:36).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REVIVAL OF THE HEBREW LANGUAGE</H2><P>Many people readily concede that Hebrew, Greek, and Latin are dead languages. But according to the report of the Jewish Chronicle in Chicago, Hebrew is still alive and useful. The Palestine Weekly said that there were many sceptics who have declared that the Hebrew language is dead and is useless to the modernists, in the same way that ancient Greek and Latin are useless. But there is a group of people living in Palestine now whose daily language is nothing but Hebrew. The reason this ancient language can catch up with time and become a modern language is that it has a self-reviving ability and that there are constant additions to its vocabulary. During the past ten years the Hebrew language has added more than a few thousand new words. These new words are found in all the major dictionaries of various languages. The reason the Hebrew vocabulary can encompass such a wide scope is probably due to the influence of the English-Hebrew Dictionary compiled by Dr. Waldstein. This dictionary contains over twenty thousand common and special words and their equivalents in English and other languages.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEVIL PERFORMING<br>MIRACLES AND WORKS OF WONDERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Translated from the February issue<br>of the Watch magazine)</H2><P>The following news is from India: A monk can heal sickness just by touching the sick with his hands. A train carried many helpless patients and handicapped persons to him in crowded carriages. The monk could heal them all, and he did not charge them a single dime. Because the cry for help was so urgent, he recruited five disciples and taught them the power and secret of healing, so that all of them were able to perform miracles and heal sicknesses in the same way that he did. But the disciples could only perform one healing per day.</P><P>In these days many of the Lord's people readily accept the power of healing; they think that all healings are from God. This case shows that they should be warned and should be careful. This monk did not know the true God; he was a Gentile who did not believe in the Lord Jesus. Yet by the laying of his hands on others, sicknesses were healed. We are not denying God's work of healing today, but we are saying that even Satan can perform healing. For this reason the saints should be very careful and should remember that Antichrist will come quickly, "the coming of whom is according to Satan's operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie" (2 Thes. 2:9). "For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, the chosen" (Mark 13:22). In the future Antichrist will deceive "those who dwell on the earth on account of the signs which he was given power to do" (Rev. 13:14). On that day, many evil-doers will say to the Lord, "Was it not in Your name that we...did many works of power?" (Matt. 7:22). "And Jesus began to say to them, See that no one leads you astray....But you, beware; I have told you all things beforehand" (Mark 13:5, 23).</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(5)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11, November 1926<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CELEBRATING CHRISTMAS</H2><P>December is before us, and those in the denominations are celebrating Christmas again. In the opinion of many believers, to celebrate Christmas and to set aside a day during the year to remember the birth of the Savior is a very good thing. I dare not despise the opinion of God's children. However, other than man's opinion, there is still a unique standard-God's Word, the Bible. Our question and what we are concerned with is not what men say, but what God has said. "Thus saith the Lord" is the highest court for everything.</P><P>Is there a command in the Bible for us to remember the Lord's birth? If God's children would ask this question, they would be enlightened by God's light. But what a pity that many have forgotten the need to ask this question. According to the Bible, the Lord only commanded us to remember His death at His supper. He did not command us to celebrate Christmas or Easter! These festivals are the poison left from Catholicism! A man who firmly believes in the Bible would surely agree that what God has not commanded is as meaningful as what He has commanded. Many have said: "God has not forbidden us to celebrate Christmas." But has God commanded that we celebrate it? One of the most lamentable things is that believers would search the Scriptures to find justification for their sins and their lust. "Since the Bible has not forbidden this, why can't we do it?" Oh, how I wish that God's children would not say such a word! May God strengthen us to say, "If God has not commanded, how would I dare to do it?"</P><P>Oh, in this age of apostasy, God's children have to be very careful. The standard of our walk is not whether or not God has forbidden something, but whether or not God has commanded something. Not only should we refrain from that which God has forbidden, but we should not do that which God has not commanded. If God's children would obey God's word in this way, will there be any ground left for man's tradition and system? But it is regrettable that man always wants to avoid the sharp edge of the sword of the Spirit. As long as something is not forbidden, even though there is no commandment from God, and even though the matter is absolutely contrary to the spirit of the cross of the Lord Jesus, the fact that there is no explicit prohibition means that one can therefore act according to the flesh! How feeble is such a heart in obeying God's word!</P><P>Let us come back to the subject of the Savior's "Christmas." Our wise Lord has known that the remembrance of this day is useless. This is why we cannot find from the Bible the month and the day that Christ was born. In writing the Bible, the Holy Spirit purposely obliterated this date. This shows the Lord's intention concerning this matter. What a pity that many people are still conjecturing according to their mind. The Bible did not mention December 25. But how did man come up with December 25?</P><P>Mr. Greswell has made an in-depth study into this question. According to his research and reasoning, Christ should have been born on April 5. But this is also a mere conjecture, and it is not a historical fact. Since the Bible has not said anything, no one can say definitely when the Lord Jesus was born. Nevertheless, we can say definitely that December 25 is not Christ's birthday. Luke 2:8 tells us that when the Lord Jesus was born, shepherds were watching over the sheep. According to the custom and habit of the day, when October came, the shepherds no longer kept watch over their flock by night. There could not be such a thing as shepherds being in the wilderness at the end of December. Furthermore, if the Lord Jesus had been born in the heart of winter in December, how could Mary who was pregnant for ten months have traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem? Our Lord's own word says, "Pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on a Sabbath" (Matt. 24:20).</P><P>Since the Lord's birthday was not December 25, where does Christmas come from? Who set the date of December 25?</P><P>We can look at the words of the ancient father, Tertullian. What he said characterizes the condition of the Christians at the end of the second century and the beginning of the third century.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>If we do not have the right to keep the heathen festivals with the heathen, how sinful it will be if brothers gather together for such a purpose. Who can bear with this? The Holy Spirit caused the Jews to be ashamed of their festivals. He said, `Your new moons, [Sabbaths,] and your appointed feasts My soul hates' (Isa. 1:14). We who do not have these new moons, Sabbaths, and appointed feasts, which God once loved, how can we turn to celebrate the Saturn festival, the New Year, and the winter solstice? Should we have presents, the ringing sound of New Year's gifts, games, and the noise of feasting? Oh, if the heathen were more faithful to the religion they serve, they would have no need for Christians to join their ceremonies! Even if they were to understand the Lord's Day...would they thereby join us? They would be too afraid of being identified by others as Christians. Yet we are not afraid of being identified as heathen!</P><P>This passage shows that the origin of many Christian holy festivals is but a transformation of idol worshipping. Christians were not willing to be set on a hill (Matt. 5:14). As a result, they retreated to the deep valleys and tried to be inconspicuous and unnoticed by the world. (Here we would add a word of love: the present Society for the Promotion of Christianity, together with those who are ignorant of God's heart and His Word, try to utilize our national festivals and Christianize them. But this is to secularize the Christians. What a pity this is!) They followed the heathen to keep their feasts with altered names and titles. But why would they set the Lord's birthday at December 25? Three days prior to this day is the winter solstice, which is the shortest day of the year. After the twenty-fifth, the days begin to be longer. Idol worshippers everywhere in the world take this day as the birthday of the sun god. In Rome at that time, the great festivals were conducted at the grand theaters as celebrations of this feast. The Christians tried to take this date for celebrating the Savior's birth. If we read the words of the ancient father ______, we will realize that this date was ordained by men only. He said:</P><P>"This day (December 25) was recently made the birthday of Christ in Rome, so that while the idol worshippers are busy with their worldly ceremonies, the Christians can quietly accomplish their holy ceremonies. They call this day the birthday of the unfailing One (i.e., the sun). Yet who can be unfailing as our Lord who has removed death? They call this day the birthday of the sun, but the Lord is the real Sun of righteousness!" This is the way the church at that time adopted the idol worshippers' festival as its own illegitimate child. This is the cause of the defilement of the truth of Christ.</P><P>How clear it is that Christmas is made by man! Since it is made by man, why do we have to keep it? God has not commanded man to remember His Son's birthday! Since He has not commanded us to do so, why should we keep it? All faithful children of God should know how to answer this question.</P><P>Why do men celebrate Christmas? I am afraid that there is more realization of the flesh than remembrance of spiritual things! The jesting, laughter, amusement, and much other wantonness that disturbs the quietness of the spirit are not only harmful to the body, but inflict deadly wounds to the spirit. After I was saved, I attended some of these services. When I returned home from these meetings, I was not happy. On the contrary, I had to confess my sins before the Lord for participating in these meetings. Strictly speaking, Christmas parties at their worst are nothing but opportunities for the flesh, and at their best are something to stir up the soul and to cause confusion. The most beneficial thing for the spirit is to keep the Lord's Word, to remember only the Lord's death, and nothing else. Hence, in order to receive the greatest benefit, we should not celebrate Christmas.</P><P>I do not know when God's children will separate the worldly things from the spiritual things, the human things from the divine things. If our brothers and sisters will one day happily separate themselves from the literary clubs, the concerts, the welcome parties, the entertainment clubs, and the social gatherings, and will make a clear-cut separation from the world, they will receive power to be God's witnesses. Alas, jesting is the greatest destroyer of a godly living, and revelling is a worm in one's spiritual living! Social celebrations and gatherings are the weapons that put the believers' holy life and power under a siege! Young believers should beware of these things!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT NUMBER OF RETURNED JEWS</H2><P>In July this year, there were one thousand sixty Jews who returned to Palestine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORLD CONVENTION OF JEWISH YOUTHS</H2><P>A world convention of Jewish youths was held in Paris recently.

The most open demonstration of their meeting was their mass congregation at the concert hall with two thousand in attendance. Most of them are delegates to the convention and local Jews from Buffalo. The meeting was held on Sunday evening, and the hall was adorned with Zionist decorations, which filled the ceiling and the four walls with blue and white colors. These two colors are a symbol of Palestine.</P><P>Their leader, David Yellin, gave a speech in Hebrew. While he was speaking, the audience would applaud intermittently. This showed their appreciation of his words. Yellin described the changes that had taken place in the Jewish land within the past six years, that wars had turned Palestine into a rubble, and that other factors had caused the Palestinian population to dwindle to forty thousand. But now they are beginning to walk out of these tribulations, and a young and strong colony is being formed, with a population of more than one hundred fifty thousand and growing faster year by year. Yellin also said, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In my opinion, our work toward the Hebrew language and in Palestine during the past six years exceeds that of the last thirty years. Now the time is near; through this material and spiritual growth, the Palestinian Jews are able to attain a strength undreamed of ten years ago and to build up a Jewish nation with five hundred thousand Jews closely knitted together....I send you greetings on behalf of the Congress of our Jewish homeland. This homeland is advancing day by day before our eyes, and its hidden life is being made manifest...These three days as I sat together with you, I felt like I was sitting together with all the Israelites in the holy city. Your faith has been strengthened through your contact with each other and with your leaders. You have set your minds to make the coming year shine with splendor, so that the work done in Palestine in previous years would be pale by comparison. You should press on as you have resolved to do, and perhaps you will receive more than you have hoped for.</P><P>After reading this speech, we can see how earnest were his words and how full of life they are! The Jews have high hopes indeed. According to the prophecies in the Bible, the Jews will be revived before Christ comes back again, and they will return to their homeland and will prosper. When Christ comes, they will receive Him as the Messiah. In observing the vigorous and prospering condition of the Jews, we have to admit that the recovery of the nation of Israel must be a reality before our eyes. The fig tree has indeed sprouted, and summer is near. "So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors" (Matt. 24:33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EVEN THE DEAD ONES RETURNING</H2><P>We have seen that many Jews are returning to their homeland. Now, not only are the living returning; the dead ones are also returning! Thirty years ago many zealous Jews organized a Zionist organization. The goal of this organization is to develop the land of Palestine and to help the Jews to return to their homeland to rebuild their homes. The recent prosperity of the Jewish land is a direct result of the work of the Zionists. The founder of this organization was Herzl. One of the most famous co-workers of Herzl was Dr. M. Nordau. Both of them have died long ago. Now Nordau's bones have been transported to the Jewish land. Soon Herzl's bones will be returned also. Let us quote the words of the New Palestine:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Fifteen thousand Jews received the bones of Nordau at the train station. Scouts and others all put on their military uniforms. These together with a few thousand students came to maintain order among the crowd who came to honor their dead leader. The Jewish nation is not just receiving the living, but the dead ones also. Now Nordau is once again living among us, and he is in his homeland forever! Now our feet can safely trod on our ancestors' graves. Herzl will come back soon, and we shall rejoice by the graves of these prophets. Now we are safely dwelling in our homeland. Nordau has returned. The bones of Joseph have returned from Egypt to the land of Israel!</P><P>We praise God that all these refer to the glory of the millennium. The dry bones of Israel will soon become a standing man. The millennium is before our eyes. The Lord is coming soon, and we should be ready and watchful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHANGING THE TIMES</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Translated from the U.S. magazine, Watch and Pray)</H2><P>Daniel prophesied that when Antichrist comes, he will change the times (Dan. 7:25). The word "times" here refers to years. Antichrist will no doubt try to change the way we reckon the years. In other words, he will try to change the calendar. In relation to this, we know that the League of Nations is now intending to change the calendar. There are now 137 different proposals being submitted to the committee for the reformulation of the calendar. How interesting this is, and how amazing it is! Even in these minor matters, the prophecies are being fulfilled, as preparations for the coming of the end.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BABYLON AND THE SEA</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Translated from the same magazine)</H2><P>Revelation shows us that the future great city, the Great Babylon, has much to do with ships. All the ships and captains pay much attention to it. The interesting thing is that man has now dug out sixteen million tons of dirt from the ancient Babylonian waterway, and large vessels can now sail on the waters of Mesopotamia. The Jewish Mission Report said, "In this way, the road is now open for there to be great commerce when Babylon is rebuilt again."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RETURNED JEWS</H2><P>In 1925, there were 31,650 Jews who returned to the Holy Land. They brought along with them 1.3 million pounds sterling. Mr. S. B. Rohold said, "A certain Jewish leader was not yet a true Christian. But he has noticed that in every room of a Jewish hotel, there is one New Testament Bible."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BELIEVING JEWS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Translated from the U.S. magazine, Awake)</H2><P>The reports from all sides show that the Jews are having increased interest in Christianity. It is said that many Jews in Palestine love to hear God's Word. Even the son of the founder of Zionism, Mr. Theodore Herzl, has become a Christian and has joined the Baptist Church. Someone has reckoned that within the last eight years in Hungary alone there are more than eighty thousand Jews who have joined the church. This forms a sharp contrast to the seventy-two thousand Jews who joined Protestantism in the nineteenth century. Someone else has calculated that in terms of percentages the present number of Jewish Christians is five times that of the Gentile Christians. It is said that in England and Europe Jews occupy more than six hundred pulpits. The recovery of the Jews is an undisputed fact, and the time for the "natural branches" to be grafted in is at hand (Rom. 11:21-23). Of course, the believing and saved Jews are part of the church, and they have nothing to do with the Jewish remnant, who will be in the tribulation. But more than the fact that a greater number of Jews are believing in Christ, the time when they will rise up to be the preachers to the world has drawn near. Some have said that the Jews in these days, if scattered among the nations, would be able to speak a total of 492 languages. They can indeed preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens to the whole world within three and a half years, for they will no longer need to learn new languages, like the missionaries do who are going to a foreign country now.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ADVANCES IN PALESTINE</H2><P>Sir Wyndham Deedes said, "If Palestine is to go on progressing at the same speed as it does now, within fifteen years their works and enterprises will be so developed that the Jews will be able to manage everything in their own land." This means that the Jews will become another nation again. The British government has intended for a long time to make the East prosperous. Now it is going ahead with its plan. The building of the port at Haifa is part of this plan, and a million pounds have been spent on the project. Underground oil pipes are being laid directly from Mesopotamia to Haifa. In May of this year, 17,500 returned Jews moved into Palestine. In addition, the Jews were enthusiastically responding to the call of the Zionists engaged in battles in South Africa. Mr. Nahum Sokolom said that the hope of the Zionists is in the farmers. For the Jews to return to farming is a great mystery and a great salvation. In this way, the Jews are fast becoming the most amazing nation of the world! In finance and politics, many Jews have made outstanding achievements. The Romanian Congress recently elected four Jews as congressmen and five as representatives. The Polish government is opening all its departments to Jews and fulfilling its promise to the Association of Jews. This is the first time since the establishment of the Polish government that Jews have been admitted to be members of the Congress. The Zionist movement has received its legal status in Poland. Indeed, the fig tree is sprouting! "Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes....For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming" (Matt. 24:42, 44).</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(6)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 13, 14, January and February 1927<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE JEWS</H2><P>In the last one hundred years, the United States has been able to assimilate all kinds of peoples into one culture. The Jews are an exception. This is a miracle. Had it not been for the fact that it is so difficult for them to be assimilated, after more than twenty-five hundred years of exile they would have become the same as the Gentiles. But God has promised through the Old Testament prophets that He would gather the Jews back to their country again. If they had been assimilated, how could they return? This is why God has preserved their national distinctiveness for more than two thousand years! This is a proof of the reality of the biblical prophecies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PLANNING OF A NEW COLLEGE</H2><P>During the past two years, someone has considered building a British-style college on the Mount of Olives with $250,000. The reality of this college is the present British College in Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOSPITALS ESTABLISHED IN PALESTINE</H2><P>The United Hadassah Society, the American Zionist Women's Association, and the American Medical Association are prepared to spend one million dollars to build a few hospitals in Palestine. The medical department of the Hebrew University will be incorporated into this project.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEL AVIV AND JAFFA</H2><P>The Jewish settlement office has agreed on a plan to make Tel Aviv (a fast-developing city close to Jaffa) the hub of a railway network in Palestine. Ludd (about ten miles from Tel Aviv) was originally the crossroads for the Kantara-Haifa and Jaffa-Jerusalem line. Now the crossroads will be transferred to Tel Aviv. In this way Tel Aviv and Jaffa will be greatly rewarded, because the office has agreed to build the harbor in Haifa and not in Jaffa.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORK OF THE JEWS</H2><P>The work of building waterways and roads around Haifa harbor has already employed six to seven hundred Jews.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE AMAZING CHANGES IN PALESTINE</H2><P>Recently, Mr. ______ has a report in the World Report concerning the progress of the work in Palestine. He wrote the following: </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Every aspect of the work in Palestine is amazing. Everyone is busy, and no one is idle. Progress in building can be seen everywhere throughout the country. Residential houses are going up in hundreds, as are shops and factories. Jerusalem has some very tall buildings, and one twelve-story office building is being constructed which looks like an Egyptian palace. Wages are high, and, in short, the people are happy and satisfied.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>However, five years ago when the land was taken back by the British from the Turks, it was a bankrupt and deserted country. At that time very few cities had escaped the damage of the war. All arable fields were left untilled. Areas where the Turkish armies had passed through were even more devastated. Riots and lawlessness were rife, and there were always robberies by nomad Arabs. Not one aspect of Palestine, including its finances, industry, social order, and politics, was left undamaged.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>At present, the cleanliness and orderliness of Jerusalem surprised me. It has been found out that the mortality rate is the same as that in London. The health department is also doing its best. The narrow streets are being cleaned regularly. One thing that the British government paid attention to was to clean out the small ponds and to cover them up. There were about six thousand of them, and some of them had not been cleaned for more than a hundred years. Now mosquito-borne malaria and the suffering of fevers caused by the summer months in Jerusalem are all removed.</P><P>We believe that more changes will come. The faithful Zionists said that they will turn Palestine into another Eden. This reminds us of Joel 2:3 which says that the Holy Land will be as Eden. But it also mentions a great army coming in to destroy and to lay the land waste to desolation once more. This fact will indeed be fulfilled. After the Zionists have accomplished their enterprises, the nations will come up to devastate the land again. But by that time, the Lord will come and deliver the remnant among the Israelites who fear the Lord. The prosperity of Palestine is nothing but a sign to us that our days are about to end.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DISCOVERY OF ANCIENT SITES</H2><P>Archaeologist Professor Sellin was satisfied that he had unearthed the altar of Abraham and the tomb of Joseph in Shechem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DISCOVERY OF THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS</H2><P>The traveling archaeologists from the University of Chicago had hoped to discover evidences of ancient traffic between Egypt and Palestine. At present they are digging at a hill twenty-five miles southeast of Haifa. They bore such hope because the ancient Meggido fortress guarded the pass at Mount Carmel, and the ancient Hebrews collected taxes from the traveling merchants who traveled between Egypt and Damascus. On the ancient site of Meggido, they found a synagogue built at the time of the Roman reign. It could have been one of the synagogues mentioned in the New Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DISCOVERY OF THE JERUSALEM WALL</H2><P>Most of the third wall of Jerusalem has been unearthed and exposed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES</H2><P>The World Council of Churches has completed its plan for convening at Geneva, Switzerland in 1930. Members of this committee comprise all kinds of people-Christians, Roman Catholics, Protestants, Greek Orthodox believers, and representatives of heretical groups. Those who are familiar with Bible prophecies will not be surprised at such councils. It is only one of the councils mentioned in Psalm 2. This council will convene in 1930 and will focus on religious issues. As Psalm 2 says, "The kings of the earth take their stand, / And the rulers take counsel together, / Against Jehovah and against His Anointed" (v. 2). In other words, this council is a conference of atheists. The purpose of the conference is to try to remove Judaism and Christianity from the earth. In reading the Bible, we can see that at that time there will be human institutions set up. Within this institution the spirit which operates is "the man of lawlessness...the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, setting himself forth, saying that he is God" (2 Thes. 2:3-4). The report of this conference goes: "The World Council of Churches has been formed and will convene in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1930. There are sixty-nine executive members, four of whom are Jews. Other executive members include Catholics, Protestants, Greek Orthodox, and even Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Zoroastrians, Confucians, Shintoists, Taoists, and so forth."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A MODERN-DAY MESSIAH</H2><P>In India there is a kind of spiritualist organization. It is a product of heresies. One Mrs. ______, a British woman, is their leader. A few decades ago she saw two handsome Indian brothers, and she adopted them as her sons. One of them was supposedly the coming great world Teacher, the reincarnation of the Messiah. The father of the two boys thought that the sons belonged to him and that Mrs. ______ had no right to take custody of them. The two fought for a long time. Eventually the court ruled that the two boys should belong to the lady, and that the father had no right to interfere with them. The British lady provided them with the best education. One of them was called ______, and was claimed by Mrs. ______ to be the so-called Christ. He has now graduated from Oxford University. According to the lady, last October the "spirit of Christ" had already descended upon him and had ordained him as the unique Teacher of the world, and before October the "spirit of Christ" had used him a few times already. Now this new "Christ" has traveled from England to America. We will quote a report from Our Hope in America:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>When the new Messiah ______ arrived in the U.S., every newspaper reported concerning him and called him God-among-men. Some reported that he was a handsome young man, with bright dark eyes. We can predict his prosperity, for hundreds of foolish young women and ladies will follow him. They will love to hear his foolish talk, in the same way that they admire film stars that they see in the movies.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>When this Indian reached America, he said, "I wish to see a fundamental change in American religion. I expect that by my coming, you will have a new religion." The bald seventy-nine-year-old Mrs. ______, who had claimed to be the leader of all the deceiving spiritualists throughout the world, stood by him and smiled. The manager of a newspaper, Mr. James B. Pond, was smiling also.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>One reporter asked if he would weep for New York City, in the same way that the Lord Jesus wept for Jerusalem. He answered, "I am not here to preach repentance and forgiveness of sins. I believe that the most important thing is to live happily, to not do anything that will harm others, to love, and to forbear." Some asked, if he were the Messiah, why he would not live as frugally as Gandhi. He said, "I am very frugal. I do not take meat or drink. I do not marry or dance. However, I swim and I play tennis."</P><P>Mrs. ______ claimed that this Indian young man is the "voice of God," and the "great world Teacher." These are words of blasphemy. Will such claims produce any result? Well, many, many foolish women and feeble-minded men will follow him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS</H2><P>The Bible predicts that before the Lord Jesus comes to earth, the old Roman Empire will be revived. We know that the old Roman Empire was quite large and that its empire has now disintegrated into many powerful nations. The many great nations in Europe are but small parts of the Roman Empire. The Bible tells us that these nations will eventually become a federation of ten nations. The head of this federation will be Antichrist. We believe that the League of Nations now is the forerunner of this federation. Those who study prophecy should pay attention to the League of Nations. Mr. Panton has pointed out that although England has rejected the proposal in Geneva, this rejection will not succeed, because all the nations in the League were under the former rule of the Roman Empire. Russia, Germany, and America were not under the rule of the old Roman Empire. At present, the nations that rule over Rome are Italy, Greece, France, Spain, and England. All these are main parts of the Roman Empire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DICTATORSHIP IN EUROPE</H2><P>The whole of Europe is turning more and more toward dictatorship. Mussolini is the originator. It seems to be working for him to cover up the economic crisis with personal politics. Belgium has allowed its king to dictate its finances. Its government has handed over control of its finances to its king, and it is about to hand over absolute control to him, just as Italy has done to Mussolini. France is doing the same thing, and other nations are following suit. The deposed Greek ruler liked to call himself "the Greek Mussolini." All these things are rapidly fulfilling the prophecies in the Bible. One day a great dictator will come and will rule over the finances, politics, and commerce of the whole of Europe. This dictator will be the small horn in Daniel 7. How soon will he appear?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIMINISHING PROTESTANTS</H2><P>The archbishop of ______ said that he was shocked at the condition of the believers in continental Europe. Mr. ______ of Manchester University has written us, saying:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>This summer I went to a Protestant parish. There was a Protestant church there. Every day it pulled the bell twice, once at 11 o'clock before noon, and once at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. But I did not see anyone entering the church or coming out of it. I asked the supervisor what this meant. He told me that the bell was for the villagers. I asked, "Does this not also mean that there is a service?" He said, "No. Before the War, there might have been one. But not anymore." At present, the Roman Catholic Church is getting stronger and stronger. The Thames reported on July 31, 1926, the words of Mr. ______ saying, "Men are interrogated and punished in Spain for singing in their own homes; they are not allowed to preach or to mention the Bible in public."</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(7)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16, April 1927<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN TEL AVIV</H2><P>Seventeen years ago, Tel Aviv (near Joppa) was just a plot of sand. Now it has become a new city. Most of the Jews in Palestine live here. The population is about forty-three thousand. All of them speak Hebrew. The government in Palestine has built a major railway between Tel Aviv and ______.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NUMBER OF JEWS ENTERING PALESTINE</H2><P>Before September 8, 1926, there were twenty-one thousand Jews who had entered Palestine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE JEWS LIVING IN PALESTINE</H2><P>"The organization responsible for the settling of Jewish families in Palestine...has an agenda for the next ten years: once every year it will resettle about thirty thousand Jews in Palestine." (This is an excerpt from a speech by Mr. ______ in the German Zionist conference.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONVENIENCE OF TRANSPORTATION</H2><P>Now between Jerusalem and ______, there are regularly scheduled buses. The journey takes three and a half days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SHAKE-UP IN THE THINGS OF NATURE</H2><P>During the past year, the news has been filled with reports of natural calamities. In some places there were earthquakes. One record said that there was not a single day in 1926 when there was not an earthquake somewhere. South Florida was damaged by storms and torrential rain. Thousands of homes were deluged, and a few million homes were damaged and suffered great destruction. In addition, countless persons were injured. No one knows what has happened to the universe. According to their common theory, scientists think that the calamities came from the black spots in the sun. However, no one knows this definitely. The prophet Haggai spoke of the Lord overthrowing the throne of kingdoms and the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen (Hag. 2:22). The Scripture also says, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven" (Heb. 12:26). These changes in nature are but a warning to us and a sign that tells us that the end is near. It is also an indication of the suffering that will quickly come to the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO CHANGE IN EUROPE</H2><P>Although there is the work of the ______ treaty and the alliance of the nations, the political situation in Europe still has not improved. Some have suggested that if the United States would write off some of its loans, there would be some positive results. But others have said that this is useless. Mussolini is still the conspicuous character on the Continent. His friendship with the Vatican is becoming more and more apparent. All the other politicians in Europe seem to be afraid of this boyish and amazing Italian. Recently, we have not heard much about his ambitious desire to recover the former glories of Rome and to be the master of Europe. Everywhere in Europe, there are still intense preparations for war. World peace and disarmament are nowhere to be seen. Some have written something in the newspaper roughly along the following lines: "The preservation of peace is the great problem we are faced with today. While this question is very obvious, yet the obvious questions are many times the hardest to solve. Disarmament will surely avert wars. But will they not be able to build up arms again even after they have disarmed themselves? Recent experiences have shown that the works and plans of the League of Nations have failed; it can no longer maintain world peace. What we need today is the concerted efforts of good-intentioned, wise, capable, and moral leaders." We have heard comments such as these over and over again. They are completely meaningless. All of this unrest proves that God's word is real. In the old days, He had already foretold the conditions of today. This world will not have peace until the Lord comes back to reign on earth and to begin His righteous and just rule.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHANGES IN JERUSALEM</H2><P>Jerusalem is changing rapidly. Steady improvements have not only expanded the original suburbs, but have opened up new suburbs. The waterworks of ______ have been prepared in a good way, and last summer there was no lack of water. Water in the houses and on the streets flows easily, and there is no blockage anywhere. The streets have been widened and repaved. Joppa Road is a major street in Jerusalem. Previously, it was a street which was famous for being muddy in winter and for being dusty in summer. Now it is up to the standard for a capital city. Many of the long-awaited houses are also being built, although up to now most are built only on the main streets. The central post office has also been erected in a beautiful way. The city is full of new houses, with water, electricity, and sanitary facilities. All the new dwellers are happy and satisfied.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BELIEVING JEWS</H2><P>According to the report of the manager's office of the Jewish Telegraph, since the European War, there are twenty thousand believers in ______.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SILK FARMING</H2><P>The Jewish government has ordered officers everywhere in the Jewish land to increase the cultivation of silkworms, and it has promised the villagers that it will promote the supply for this business and furnish information on the modern cultivation of silkworms.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TELEPHONES</H2><P>On August 19, Jerusalem announced that Palestine and Syria will soon be able to communicate with each other via telephone.

It is also the place where Moses struck the rock to get water. In these days, there is still water coming out from the creeks there. In the whole Sinai wilderness, this kind of creek is only found here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AGRICULTURE</H2><P>In order to meet the need of the new colonies near ______, and in order to irrigate the whole Jewish land, many proposals have been made. According to the request of the agricultural department, the Zionist convention has advanced three hundred fifty thousand dollars.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REVIVING OF PALESTINE</H2><P>A certain person who has recently returned from Palestine after a few weeks' stay discussed the wonders of the rebuilding of Palestine: "I have investigated some cities and colonies, thirty in all. I cannot describe with words how I have been impressed." The rabbi also said that there will be a bumper crop this year in Palestine, that the crises in Tel Aviv and other places were but temporary, and that they are over by now.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY</H2><P>According to modern Jewish lawyers, the University in Jerusalem is progressing very well. The Jews are famous for their intelligence not only in Palestine, but in the whole world. Recently, the director of the Hebrew University has gathered together representatives of all the Zionist organizations throughout the world. According to their recent records, all the Jewish students throughout Europe have been very interested in the development of the Hebrew University and have placed high hopes in it. The director said that these students consider this university to be the means to uplift Judaism and to succeed in bringing forth new knowledge. They see this as a center for the revival of Judaism and as the means to make Palestine once more the center of academic learning. He also reported that subjects in the humanities are continually expanding, and that other schools have similar progress. The agricultural lab of this university has already performed some crucial experiments, the result of which will bring major contributions to the national agriculture. According to the director, the library of the university has been much developed; the value of its treasures and the number of volumes of its books can match any library in Europe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WATER IN JORDAN<br>AND DEVELOPMENTS IN JUDEA</H2><P>All those who pay attention to the movement of the Jews realize that a new age has dawned for the Jews. We will quote one moving account concerning the development of Palestine:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>According to the words of one Jerusalem member of the patriotic Jewish society, development of hydroelectric power on the river Jordan is one of the most notable works of the Jews who have returned to Palestine. This person has been living in Jerusalem for nineteen years. He is now traveling around the nations to tell others about these things in the hope of encouraging the Jews living abroad to migrate back to the Holy Land. He said, "Last year, over thirty thousand Jews (from eastern and central Europe) returned to their motherland. From America, few have returned, except those who are invited to go back to teach people of various professions. Since the war, works in Palestine have been developing at a tremendous pace. During the past one to two years, many projects have been initiated. There is the development of the Jordan hydroelectric works. The planning of this project has been completed, and perhaps by the end of the year, different factories will be operated with the power drawn from the Jordan River. Among the 150,000 Jews in Palestine, 30,000 work on the farms. They are all using the new ways. Palestine can now provide food for three million people. At present, it has about 850,000, among which 700,000 are Arabs. The Arabs have sold their lands to the returned Jews. In this way, there has been no conflict between the local Jews and the newly returned Jews. The Jews want to establish their own nation in Palestine, and they are receiving help and relief from everywhere. England has helped her the most, because it is one of her allies. It is exercising its power to help the Jews, and it is giving the Jews much freedom in their religion and in their work of improvement.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LETTER FROM PALESTINE</H2><P>The following is a letter from Palestine. It shows us briefly some of the developments in Palestine, and the riches and beauty of Joppa and other places. Indeed, according to prophecy, one day we will see Palestine blossoming as a rose. In the land of Israel there will be many Jews, just as Ezekiel 36 describes. The letter said, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>This spring has been balmy and pleasant. There has been much rain, and the temperature has been cool. We are wearing lighter clothing. It is a joy to leave the cold plateau of Jerusalem and to come down to the plain of Joppa. There is a lovely mildness in this land. Concerning the scenery: the places which used to have barren rocks and hilly places are now filled with wheat fields and with grape and orange gardens. I recall the words of Song of Songs: "The winter is past, the rain is over and gone" (2:11). When we arrived in ______, the air there was filled with attractive scents, the smell of oranges. The air was so sweet that even the eastern garden that used to be unappealing has now been filled with fragrance....</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(8)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 19, July 1927<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WOMAN AND THE BEAST</H2><P>If we put Mussolini together with the Pope, we can easily identify them as a type of the woman in scarlet riding on the red beast in Revelation 17. Cardinal Merry del Val of the Vatican not long ago, in an apparently carefully prepared public speech, spoke of Mussolini on behalf of the authority of the Pope, that "he is obviously a man worthy of the protection of God. He has uplifted the fate of his nation through his wisdom and has increased his prestige over the world." France is another Latin country that has made a new pact with the Pope. With anointed eyes it is easy to look at all these and see that the stage is quickly being set for the last drama of the world. Amen, let the world go by. Lord Jesus, come quickly!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BUDDHISM</H2><P>Idol worshipping has poured forth into Christian countries like a flood. One new temple worth 50,000 pounds and which can hold 2,000 worshippers has been erected in ______. Another one complete with monks and altars has been finished in ______. In Japan, monks hold 4,175 Sunday schools, in contrast to 1,891 Christian Sunday schools, and the monks have 12,754 teachers with 575,691 students, while Christians have only 7,493 teachers, with 32,080 Christian students.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WORLD JEWISH POPULATION IN 1926</H2><P>The past year has seen many new changes. In Judaism the retreat of orthodoxy is more and more apparent. In Russia those who can keep their orthodoxy are in the diminishing minority. The orthodox Jews are dying under the atmosphere of persecution. Sabbathville, a town near New York, was designed by Jews who want to keep the Sabbath. This plan is a sure proof that Jews in America have been uplifted through material riches. In August there will be a convention of modernistic Jews. At present there is a World Union of Progressive Jews. The chief Rabbi in England has tried to stop the tide of modernism through his writings and speeches.</P><P>Politically there are a few outstanding figures. Sir Herbert Samuel occupies an important place in the coal industry. He has other unofficial titles. He was greatly used in the suppression of the May riot. In Philadelphia (Oct. 13) during the All Europe Conference, a conference which paved the way for a cooperation of European nations, powerful Jews were the outstanding figures also. When Lord Reading came back from India, he was made a lord.</P><P>Palestine has received much grace under the hand of the British administrators. When Lord Plumer was administrating this place last year, there had been signs of progress in peace already. At the same time, its border with Syria has been in a state of unrest. It is apparent that the transportation plan for Palestine has become an important issue. The Haifa-Kantara will surely become a main route of traffic. Mesopotamia has been developed. Haifa will become the export harbor for oil and other products. The port of Haifa is greatly improved and renovated, and the harbor of Jaffa is also being opened up and upgraded. Gaza is along the air route from England to India, the first stop from Cairo to Karachi. The first two planes left from that place in December of 1926. This country is being developed internally. The plan of ______ is utilizing the hydroelectric power from the Jordan River for irrigation use. Hopefully the project will be completed in a month or two. Lord Reading is the chief executive of the Palestine Electric Company, which manages the hydroelectric plant project of the Jordan River. During this year many new colonies have sprung up, and they are prospering. At present a garden city is planned near the Dead Sea for a winter retreat. There is a motorway that connects Jerusalem with Bengadi. Palestine is no longer dependent on the British finance department for support, and it is mostly self-supporting. It is slowly paying back its debts. The trees in this land are growing, which brings in more rain. Every year about 30,000 people return to the land. Archaeological studies have become active in places like Jerusalem, Capernaum, and so forth. Their studies confirm many of the records of the Bible. The progress of the Jews and the success of the colonies have stirred up the Arabs to strive and improve their lot. The feeling between the Jews and the Arabs has improved. Last year a few famous Jews died, one of whom was Zanwill, who reaped much benefit for Israel. The book he wrote describes keenly and vividly the life of the Jews, and it saved the land from becoming an unknown place.</P><P>One American rabbi, Dr. Wise, has caused shocking reactions at this time by his attitude toward Christ.</P><P>These things show the condition of the Jews in 1926. The Jews are hungry spiritually. In some parts of East Europe, the gospel is desperately needed. But the Jews have little or no contact with the gospel. The end is near, and there is the urgent cry for careful, godly, and solid evangelical works among the Jews.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NO MORE WAR</H2><P>"No more war." This is what we are being told concerning the reason we went into the four terrible years of war. Many from our families have gone to war and have died. They told us that all these things are for the purpose that the world would be safe for democracy. Eight years have passed, and where are we? Of course, we can spend a lot of time to reconsider the benefit of the war, and it is true that there has never been a time when there has been as much propaganda about peace.</P><P>"No more war." Does it seem likely? Consider the following numbers: Since the disarmament conference, England has planned, or begun building, or even completed, eighteen cruisers, ten submarines, and two minesweepers. Since 1923 the budget for the British navy has reached 174,300,000 pounds. The number of British "flying ships" has reached 1,053,650.</P><P>France has also made full preparations for future war. Experts in the French navy said that in 1930 the French navy will put together four light cruisers of 10,000 tons each, three destroyers of 2,700 tons each, six destroyers of 2,400 tons each, twenty-six torpedo boats, and thirty-nine submarines.</P><P>Russia is not behind. Russian naval experts have ordered an air armada that will equal that of the British. The result is that twelve effective schools have been started and twelve thousand students have registered.</P><P>After the Washington conference, Japan has spent 355,000,000 pounds to build up its navy. Another 320,000,000 pound inventory list has been drawn up.</P><P>The United States is also stirred up in this preparation. One nationwide security list, which places armies at permanent locations and which divides the army into seventeen new camps, is ready. The leading regular army has a budget of seven million pounds. Italy, Spain, and other countries are making room for these terrible orders of destruction.</P><P>The Bible clearly says that wars will continue until they culminate in the great War. At that time the King will lead His army to fight against all the sinners and the armies of the devil. That battle will be the decisive one, and after that one the world will not know war anymore. Then swords will be beaten into plowshares and spears into pruninghooks. What a happy and blessed day that will be! Humanly speaking, we can only have faint hope that we can be delivered from the devastation of war. Our hope is in the soon coming King.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DAY OF THE COMING OF THE LORD</H2><P>To calculate the date of the Lord's coming through the so-called prompting of the Spirit is foolish unbelief as well as a proof that the act is of the devil. Mrs. White, the "prophetess" of the Seventh-day Adventists, received "revelation" before she died to appoint a certain Mrs. ______ as her heir-apparent. But the denomination has never recognized that fact. Two years ago this Mrs. ______ conveyed a "message from God." She said, "God's Son will come again on February 6, 1925. Go proclaim this quickly, and declare this news in the high places!" But the Lord did not come, and the 144,000 Adventist members who waited for the Lord were not raptured miraculously from San Diego, as she had predicted. An unannounced coming of the Lord is the secret to constant vigilance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW GOD</H2><P>I have often heard of incidents of opposition to God in Russia. It is reported that one teacher once asked the students, "Who believes that there is God?" Five or six hands were raised. Among them, two hands immediately drew back. "Who opposes God?" Many hands were raised, and the cry was heard: "God has been defeated by us!" How horrible it is that these elementary school students are indoctrinated with atheistic education before they can differentiate between good and evil!</P><P>What will be the result of this? Doubtless, many of the Russian children today will participate in the battle of Armageddon. When the Lord appears from heaven in flaming  fire to render vengeance to those who do not know Him (2 Thes. 1:7-8), five-sixths of the Russians will perish. Russia is teaching her children not to know God, and their end will be to be burned with fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMPERISHABLE MUSSOLINI</H2><P>Since the time the Italian ruler came to Rome, some have tried to assassinate him. He narrowly escaped death six times. Once a bullet went through his coat, and another time the tip of his nose was scratched. It is amazing that he has narrowly escaped death many times.</P><P>The Italians now believe that he cannot be killed. They believe that by some fortune his life is charmed and that no one will hurt him. This turns us more to his aim: he wants to revive the ancient Roman Empire in five years. The Bible tells us that in the future a very powerful man will rise up and be the ruler of the revived Roman Empire. This man will escape the sword in a miraculous way. He will be known as he "who had the stroke of the sword and revived" (Rev. 13:14). For this reason, the whole world will worship him. But the Italians are almost making Mussolini god already. The last time he escaped danger, the people cried, "Woe to whoever wants to harm the Savior of Italy!"</P><P>Just as men today consider that it is impossible for Mussolini to die, in the same way in the future there will be the cry: "Who can make war with him?" (Rev. 13:4). But Mussolini may not be the coming ruler. He may be only a shadow of the coming one.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(9)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 22, October 1927<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PAYING ATTENTION<br>TO THE THINGS IN THE EAST</H2><P>"We saw His star at its rising" (Matt. 2:2), that is, in the east. This was the word of the magi when they were looking for Christ. When Ezekiel in his vision saw the glory of Jehovah returning, it came from the east (Ezek. 43:2). Geographically speaking, in the Bible the east also refers to the east of Jerusalem.</P><P>The eyes of the earnest students of prophecy are concentrated on the uninhabited land of Palestine and on the landless people, the Jews.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED IN THE EAST</H2><P>Mr. ______, the chancellor of the American University ______, said, "The Near East needs many trained people in commerce and sociology." He said further, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The local qualified leaders should become the power base of peaceful and honest commerce and politics, and of progress and prosperity in science. Worthless leaders have cast the Near East into a corrupt, cliquish, and conservative age that is intolerant of religion and lacking in real power.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Learned people have realized the need for capable men to rise up to lead the people. Hence, we can see that the kind of person described by Daniel, who is both learned and capable, will soon be accepted as the leader and a power (Dan. 11:36).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT THE EAST DOES NOT NEED</H2><P>This same person said,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The people of the Near East will no longer be subjected to the masters in the West.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Soon after the War, many rebellions occurred in Egypt. The revolution in Syria has taken place, and Persia has obtained freedom from the hands of England and Russia. Iraq's riots have caused ______ to sign a treaty with King ______, so that it has gained autonomy in most areas. The former dynasty of ______ has been chased out by a Muslim king in northern Arabia. This king, who is not under the influence of Europe, is now ruling that land. Turkey has been freed by its local Christians, and its nation has been removed from the center of European activity; it has abolished compromising treaties and has declared its own independence. Mr. ______ has been killed, the consulate general in Germany has been killed by the Persian refugees, and Mr. ______ has been humiliated.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The same riotous condition appears in China. The daughter of one writer wrote in her letter that their mission has been attacked. The rioters were not the excited crowd, but nominal Christians who wanted to take over the control of the gospel work in China. They did not recognize Christ as all and in all. They believe that the Chinese should rule China. They have not realized that the ambition that is seen in international politics is no different from the ambition in which Christians vie to please one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DESCRIPTIONS OF THE EAST</H2><P>The same professor noted,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Local leaders have indeed been raised up. The important thing is to have the recognition of suitable leaders. The nature of the people in the East is to dislike interference from the West, and hence in the future there will be much reliance on the proper local leaders, plus men who have great foresight and who have been trained in the new principles in business. Moreover, sociology is one great and pressing work.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Before the War, the Near East was under the ruling of the old regimes. The autocracy of the few and their corruption occupied the main part of their lives. There were few modern and effective methods in commerce, administration, industry, and in agriculture as well.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In summary, the hindrance toward the prosperity of the countries east of the Mediterranean is a result of backwardness. During the European War, the many battles, famines, and the shifting of population have lowered the standard of society and economic conditions to a great degree.</P><P>What we have quoted shows that what is needed under the situation described is influential and noteworthy men from the West, and not the so-called "local leaders," "men with foresight," "commercial and sociological experts." Satan will produce such a man, because he will gain what he is after in this final work of his.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TURKEY AND EGYPT</H2><P>These two countries always occupy an important role on the eastern stage, and they will continue to play a leading role. Turkey will join itself with the king from the north, and Egypt will be the chief part of the king from the south. England will be the motivating source behind the coming ruler. The world does not know the prophecy in Daniel 11, and it is therefore observing these events with uneasiness. These events will lead to things which will shortly come to pass. Someone has said, </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>After the War, Turkey became a democracy and is aspiring to build up a new national life. Greece has a new national consciousness. Its population has greatly increased, and, through the help of the loan from the League of Nations, we can reasonably hope that it will have a renewed period of rebuilding.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Egypt has obtained limited self-rule from England. From now on, its prosperity will depend much on local leaders rather than on English initiative. Sudan has separated itself from Egypt, and Britain has moved its cotton industry here. A new dam has been built, and through this political force that is smaller than Egypt, the British cotton market can receive sustained supply. The national consciousness of Sudan has been awakened, and there is reason to believe that the local people will take a greater part in the development of their own country.</P><P>All these are a fulfillment of the writer's word: "Pay attention to the things in the East." The movement of these peoples is a fulfillment of the biblical prophecy, in the same way that a gust of wind forewarns concerning the coming storm.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE SOURCE FROM THE EAST</H2><P CLASS=INDENT1>Yemen in south Arabia may be an extremely conservative country, but a great and famous leader ______ has ruled over it. Although conservative forces are surrounding him, his modernization program is putting his country into a guaranteed advance in the new era.</P><P>The rising up of this leader is a proof of the possibility of a powerful personality. Four things can be distinguished: he comes from the East, he is a religious idealist, he is one who goes along with the tide of the age and who is in touch with the ideas of the times, and he has personal moral integrity that wins admiration and a following.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PALESTINE-THE SOURCE FROM THE EAST</H2><P>An outstanding source that is obvious even to those who are not familiar with prophecy is the promised land. It is the center of disturbances and victories in the East. In addition to its direct fulfillment of biblical prophecies, there are four things which contribute to its being an indirect cause for biblical fulfillment. These are the things we should pay attention to:</P><P>(1) Palestine has turned from an insignificant province of Turkey into a focus of attention for many people.</P><P>(2) A solid British administration has brought about order, benefit, and trust.</P><P>(3) The Zionists are accumulating very large amounts of funds.</P><P>(4) There is a land link with Iraq for commerce, which is an indicator of a new era in the rebuilding of the nation.</P><P>Among all the other things, the one subject which is most talked about, and which is most interesting, is the strong and powerful Jewish movement. This is particularly true in America, where many have poured out money to help their friends to return to Palestine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MESOPOTAMIA</H2><P>The promise made to Abraham mentioned the Great River. The river refers to the Euphrates. Things are happening here also. The Bible prophesies that Babylon will undoubtedly be rebuilt. Two factors help to make this possible. This nation is rich in oil production, and the amazing power of irrigation has caused it to express itself in beauty and efficiency. This is the point that the writer wants to make: </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In addition to the help from Britain in building itself up as a new economic power, which ensures its political stability and developing ability, Iraq is now capable of being self-dependent. Since the invasion of the Huns, this is the first time that Iraq can look forward to building a strong nation of its own. One British committee with capital of fifteen million pounds has begun irrigation projects. Effective cotton farms have been planted, and oil fields are opening up under a joint British-Persian company.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PERSIA</H2><P>In the future stage of God's work, Persia will play a part. This country will make friends with the enemy of Israel and will suffer God's severe punishment. The facts related to this country attract much of the attention of Bible students. We are not surprised to read of the following: </P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Persia is the same as Iraq: it expects a period of rebuilding. A powerful new Persian king is determined to build up a strong nation and to open up a new era. Financially, it has taken the advice of the U.S., and it is no longer attempting to conquer its neighbors by force. Instead, it is using its power for peacekeeping and order.</P><P>Ezekiel 38:1-6 mentions a league of the nations. They oppose Israel out of an evil intention. In this alliance, Persia was clearly and definitely mentioned. One outstanding thing of our time is that some insignificant nations will be ranked as prominent ones and will become strong factors in influencing the situation in the East. We should not be surprised that Persia will rank as one of the top countries.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FURTHER REPETITION<br>ON "THE THINGS OF THE EAST"</H2><P>Both the morning light as well as the rising sun comes from the East. It is there that we read of the Lord's coming again-"His going forth is prepared as the morning" (Hosea 6:3). The morning is as accurate as God's promise, as real as His authority, as definite as His faithfulness, as undiminishing as His love, as trustworthy as His word, as sure as His protection, and as eternal as Himself. Hence, may our eyes be turned to the "east", as the temple is toward the east (Ezek. 47:1-4). May our prayer be led to the mainstream of His grace, and may we receive the abundant leading in love in looking toward the "east," so that we would set our direction to the countries in the "east" according to His purpose, and so that the degrading wilderness of humanity there would be healed by the life-giving word from us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(10)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24, December 1927<br>(Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FASCIST CALENDAR</H2><P>There is one chain of Christian belief that binds the whole of Europe together; it is the calendar of our Savior. Not only has Europe remembered the birth of Christ by its calendar, but it has called it the Year of Our Lord. One new law of the Fascist Party (according to the newspaper on December 24, 1926) is that all government documents must bear two dates: one for the convenience of international communication, and the other to commemorate the revival of the Roman Empire. For example, this year is described as 1927, as well as the fifth year. The cry is near..."Let us break apart their [the Lord Jehovah's and His Christ's] bonds" (Psa. 2:3). _________ said, "Imperialism has come to a frenzied and self-deluding state in Italy. This condition has not been experienced in this peninsula since the time of Caesar. The world will surely laugh at its boasts. But it also tells of evil and terrible consequences. For this reason, uneasy feelings have become widespread."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FEW SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AMONG THE JEWS</H2><P>Dr. Welzmann said,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Without occupying any more land from the Arabs, Palestine is large enough for three million Jews to live in.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>According to the census of 1926, by 1926 the Jews have increased their number one hundred percent since 1922. This includes those who are in the cities and on the farms.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The Palestinian government has taken measures to protect the Jews praying at the "wailing wall" in Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SIXTH ESCAPE OF MUSSOLINI</H2><P>Mussolini's life was endangered for the sixth time. Yet he escaped again. He said that an unseen power is protecting him and his life is "enchanted." Most Italians believe that this is true. They consider him as god. His extraordinary charisma and his ambition to revive the Roman Empire have gained many hearts.</P><P>Recently, he was invited to give a speech at a certain place on "The Ancient Rome." The ancient emperor worship was miraculously revived when thousands of listeners cried, "Glory to him." One Italian reporter said:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Glory to him! From the fertile plains, from all the villages, from the fascists, and from everywhere under his influence, they come! They come by car or on foot. Come with your Roman banners. Come to see him. You must impress the majestic face and his willful and capable spirit once more upon your mind. You will be filled once more with power and spirit. Glory to him! If we should praise our mother, we should also praise him. Glory be to him! There will be a day in history when Mussolini will come again. By that time, it will be like Jesus of Nazareth coming to Galilee again and like Napoleon coming back from Elba again.</P><P>We believe that these are only the beginning years. In Europe many shocking developments will unfold. Mussolini will be a great leader, but we do not know if he will become the little horn in the vision of Daniel 7. At any rate, there are many areas in which this man bears the sign of that horn.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MOHAMMEDANISM</H2><P>Last July 15, the first mosque in Paris was completed. The French president, the British ambassador, and the king of Morocco attended the ceremony. On October 2, the first mosque in London was completed. At the top of the tower, five times a day someone would pray according to the Muslim regulation. The consecration ceremony was attended by Muslims who are followers of Mirza Ehulan. The newspaper reported, "He is known as the so-called promised Messiah. His coming matches some of the prophecies in the Bible and other books. He is also the promised coming prophet, that is, the one prophesied by all the prophets as the one coming at the end of the age." In Berlin, through government aid, two similar mosques have been completed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ASTROLOGERS</H2><P>A certain newspaper reported, "There is an unusual revival of astrology in London. Some have said that in the western part of London, there are at least fifteen famous ASTROLOGERS to whom people go for counsel." On October 19, 1926, the Temple of Light appeared in southern London. This was chosen by Johannez, the ex-high priest of Jerusalem, for the worship of the goddess Madam Valcees, and it was founded by the Rev. G. ValeOwen. It has an auditorium that can hold five hundred people and a few rooms for spiritual and psychological therapy. This is only one of five hundred institutions of the same kind in England.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BITTER ROOT OF EUROPEAN FINANCES</H2><P>According to three leading British economists, the one area that all European national budgets are wasting money on is national armament, the training of its armies, and the building of weapons. This is largely responsible for the malady in finances.</P><P>They pointed out that Czechoslovakia has only thirteen million people, but it has 150,000 regular soldiers, 500 planes, 160 armored vehicles, and 33 bunkers. Yugoslavia has twelve million people, but has 115,000 soldiers, 270 planes, and 128 bunkers. Romania has nineteen million people, but has 143,000 soldiers, 250 planes, 90 armored vehicles, and 33 bunkers. Poland has twenty-seven million people, half of which are non-Poles, but it has 306,000 soldiers, 510 planes, 220 armored vehicles, and 441 bunkers. The defense budgets of these countries add up to one-fifth of their national budgets. How long can these military build-ups and weaponry continue without the outbreak of another war?</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1</H2><P>All questions regarding the Bible and spiritual matters can be directed to the editor. We will do our best to answer them. However, we will not respond to fruitless questions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DAYS IN DANIEL</H2><P>Question: Daniel 8:14 says "For two thousand three hundred nights and days; then the sanctuary will be restored." According to history, the number of days in this verse is off by a little bit. According to the Guideline to Exposition published by the Seventh Day Adventists, this verse refers to a long period and concerns the end time. The basis for their theory is verse 17 of this chapter. What actually is right? (Wong, Singapore)</P><P>Answer: We must know the difference between interpretation and history in reading Daniel. We must not think that the interpretation of the biblical vision is merely a matter of relating past events. On the one hand, we have to realize that it relates to the past, and on the other hand, it adds something that has not yet happened. Most prophecies have two fulfillments, a contemporary fulfillment and a future fulfillment. History is related to the contemporary fulfillment, while the interpretations of the prophecies are related to the future fulfillment. This is true in the case of this passage. Many of the things that the prophet saw were fulfilled in his days. But many of the things the angel said as an interpretation refer to the future. Therefore, if one only takes care of history or only takes care of interpretation, he is liable to make errors.</P><P>Historically speaking, the prophecy of the two thousand three hundred days was fulfilled in Antiochus Epiphanes (please read the books of the Maccabees in the Apocrypha). The evil days of Antiochus fit in with the two thousand three hundred days. At the end of this period, on December 25 of 165 B.C., Judas Maccabee cleansed the temple.</P><P>Interpretatively speaking, this prophecy has to do with the time of the end, that is, the end time. Not only is verse 17 a proof, but verses 19 and 26 also show the same thing. But we should notice one thing: most of the expositions by the Seventh Day Adventists are far-fetched. Although they consider this prophecy to be for the end time (the end time in the Bible always refers to "the day of the Lord" before the Lord appears on the earth, that is, the last of the seventy weeks mentioned in Daniel 9), they say on page 110 of their Exposition on Daniel that the Lord Jesus entered the heavenly Holy of Holies in A.D. 1844 and started the work of judgment. How can this be the end time! Furthermore, this kind of interpretation is absolutely against the gospel and annuls the clear teaching of the book of Hebrews. They take a day as a year and consider two thousand three hundred days to be two thousand three hundred years (p. 103). They quote Ezekiel 4:6 and Numbers 14:34 as proofs. But they do not realize that these two passages only speak of the things related to these two passages; they have nothing to do with other Scriptures and, in particular, nothing to do with Daniel. In the Bible there is no basis for taking a day as a year. Please read Genesis 7:4, 10; 40:12, 13, 20; Exodus 16; Numbers 11:19-20; Joshua 1:11; Numbers 14:33; and Matthew 12:40. A day is a day; it is not a year. If the Bible considers a day a year, then the Lord Jesus would have been in the heart of the earth for three years!</P><P>The word "days" in the "two thousand three hundred days" is not days in the original language but early evening. According to Genesis 1, there is the evening, and there is the morning. Therefore, we know that it refers to a twenty-four hour day, and not a year. The early evening is the time for offering sacrifices in the temple. This means that there will be two thousand and three hundred offerings of the evening sacrifice and morning sacrifice. This confirms the sense conveyed by the Holy Spirit that the day refers to a cycle of night and day.</P><P>Historically, this word was fulfilled once in Antiochus. At the end time, it will be fulfilled once more in "the little horn."</P><P>According to the prophecy of the seventy weeks, there should be two thousand five hundred and twenty days. Two thousand three hundred days is two hundred and twenty days shorter than two thousand five hundred and twenty days. Probably these two hundred and twenty days will be days for building the temple, and the "little horn" will not desecrate the sanctuary until the two hundred and thirty-first day, and then by the end of this "week," the two thousand five hundred and twentieth day, the sanctuary will be cleansed. We look forward to the Lord's coming to rapture us. We do not look forward to the "little horn." We look forward to reigning with Christ and cleansing the sanctuary together with Him! What a blessed hope!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ANGEL IN DANIEL</H2><P>Question: Daniel 18:15 says, "And when I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought an understanding of it; and immediately there was someone with an appearance like that of a man standing before me." Some say that this angel was the Savior. Verse 16 says, "And I heard the voice of a man." They say that this voice was also the voice of the Savior. In my opinion, the angel in verse 15 is Daniel's own angel, while the voice in verse 16 refers to the Savior because only the Savior has the authority to direct Gabriel the archangel. Which interpretation is the right one? Please answer. (Wong, Singapore)</P><P>Answer: It is probably wrong to say that both refer to the Savior. The word man in verse 15 is geber in the original language, from which the name Gabriel comes. Hence, the "man" in verse 15 should refer to Gabriel. There is no clear indication as to whose voice it was in verse 16. But to me, it should be the voice of the angel who ruled over the river Ulai, who spoke under God's order.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LEAVES OF THE TREE</H2><P>Question: Revelation 22:2 says, "The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations." Yet 21:4 says, "And death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain anymore; for the former things have passed away." Why does 22:2 mention the healing of the nations? Since there is healing, there surely must be the flesh, which brings in sickness, pain, and death. In the new heaven and new earth, will we have a spiritual body or a fleshly body?</P><P>Answer: In the new heaven and new earth, man will be divided into two classes, the kings and the citizens, just like it is in the millennium. Please differentiate between "peoples" in 21:3 and "son" in 21:7. The sons will dwell in the city; they are the glorified saints throughout the ages. They will have a spiritual body. But the "nations" and the "peoples" will still have fleshly bodies. They will be the ones transferred from the millennium. There will still be the fleshly body, but there will be no death, sickness, etc. Since there is the fleshly body, there will inevitably be weaknesses, even though there will be no sickness and death. The leaves of the tree of life are for "the healing of the nations." By eating the leaves, they will forever be strong on the new earth. For the overcoming believers, they will not eat the leaves, but the fruits (2:7). Praise the Lord!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHO ARE THE DOGS?</H2><P>Question: Revelation 22:15 says, "Outside are the dogs." According to A Commentary of the New Testament, these dogs refer to the evil nature of the sinners. Can sinners still exist then? Will there not be a restoration to the condition of Eden before the fall? Where will sin be? It will surely not be in the cleansed Christians who have passed through all the tribulations and trials. Will not the sinners be thrown into the lake of fire as recorded in the last two verses of chapter twenty? (Wong, Singapore)</P><P>Answer: It is true that the dogs refer to the sinners. It is also true that the new heaven and the new earth will be a restoration of the condition in Eden. It is likewise true that sinners will be thrown into the lake of fire, and that there will be no sin in the new heaven and new earth. In the new heaven and new earth, there will only be the saved ones. But you misunderstand this verse a little. If you compare this verse with 21:8 you will find out where the sinners are; they are in the lake of fire. Revelation 22:15 tells us where the lake of fire is; it is on the new earth. The sinners are in the lake of fire, and they are also outside the city. This means that the lake of fire must be outside the city. In the old days Sodom was close to Jerusalem. Therefore, hell should be close to the New Jerusalem. In the new earth there will be a place which is the lake of fire. The lake of fire is an actual place. What a warning this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOATS IN MATTHEW 25</H2><P>Question: Will the kingdom of the goats go directly into hell? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: According to Matthew 25:41, they should go directly to hell. The "eternal fire" cannot be explained any other way. A companion passage to this verse is Matthew 13:47-50. There it clearly says "the furnace of fire."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCERNING 1 PETER 3:19 AND 4:6</H2><P>Question: How do you explain 1 Peter 3:19 and 4:6?</P><P>Answer: In order to understand 1 Peter 3:19 and 4:6, we must first know who the "sons of God" are in Genesis 6.</P><P>The "sons of God" are the angels because: (1) The whole Old Testament only mentions the sons of God a few times (in Job and Daniel). Except in this case, where nothing is explicitly said about them, all the other cases refer to angels or supernatural beings. (2) Some brothers say that the "sons of God" were the descendants of Seth, while the "daughters" were the descendants of Cain. If this is true, how could Cain beget daughters only, and Seth beget males only? (3) Seth cannot be apart from the "men" in verse 2. (4) The "sons of God" are versus the "men" in the same verse. This means that they were not men. (5) If we say that the "men" in verse 2 were the descendants of Cain, should not the "men" in verse 1 mean the same thing? (6) In verse 3 the word "also" indicates that those who were of flesh were not limited to men only. "For that he [man] also is flesh." This indicates that there were some who were not men who were of the flesh already. Some brothers argue that angels are not distinguished by sex, and that they neither marry nor are given to marriage. But Matthew 22:30 does not say explicitly that there is no distinction between male and female angels. No clear indication can be found from other Scriptures either. Therefore, we cannot say for sure if there are male and female angels. Even if there is no distinction of sex, does not the Scripture often use the pronoun he instead of she to describe the angels? This proves that at least the angels tend to be masculine. There is then no difficulty in saying that they could marry the daughters of men. Since angels do not have a body, it is even more understandable that they attached themselves to the human body. If our Lord only said that angels do not marry in Matthew 22:30, it would be difficult to assume that "sons of God" are angels. But did not the Lord say, "angels in heaven"? This means that only the angels who kept their place and dared not leave their posts (Jude 6) do not marry; all the others do. Many manuscripts have the words "of God" after the word "angels" in Matthew 22:30. This further proves that those who are not of God are not characterized by such description.</P><P>We can now return to our main subject. First Peter 3:19 and 4:6 do not teach that there is another chance for repentance after a man dies. If a man is not saved now, he will never be saved. The "spirits in prison" in 3:19 are not humans. The word spirits in the Bible does not always refer to man. There are two uses of the word spirit: (1) it refers to the evil spirits, and (2) it refers to man's spirit. This expression is continued in the next verse which shows that these spirits were the disobedient ones at the time of Noah.</P><P>Therefore, our conclusion is that these spirits are the angels who have sinned. They have left their place and come to the world to marry humans. They did not obey God and were destroyed by the flood; their spirits went down into Tartarus and are waiting for their judgment to come. (The testimony of 2 Peter 2:4 through 5 matches our interpretation. The word hell in the Chinese Union Version is a mistranslation. The Hebrew word is Tartarus, which refers to the heart of the earth.) These angels sinned in the likeness of man. When man sinned against God, the Lord Jesus came to accomplish redemption. Since these ones were in the likeness of man (taking human bodies and marrying the daughters of men), and since they sinned as men did, they could be redeemed just the same way that man could.</P><P>According to the above interpretation of 1 Peter 3:19, the meaning of 4:6 should become very obvious. (We cannot interpret the words "those who are now dead" spiritually and consider these ones to only be spiritually dead because: (1) there is no basis for allowing such a spiritual interpretation, and (2) the word "also" rules out such an interpretation. The tone of this word implies something special. It is common and natural to preach the gospel to those who are spiritually dead, and there is nothing special about this. Since it says, "the gospel was announced also to those who are now dead," it implies that these dead ones were special and not men who are dead in sin.) The dead here does not refer to dead men, but to the above-mentioned angels who had sinned. The gospel was preached also, or even, to them. Therefore, it was something special. It is indeed special to preach the gospel to the angels. "Was announced" means that the gospel was preached to them but is no longer preached to them. Christ went to Tartarus to preach the gospel to them once. The result was that their flesh, the body to which they attached themselves at the time they sinned, was judged "according to men." (The expression "according to men" further proves that they were not men, but were only judged according to men.) Their spirits, "the spirits in prison" will live according to God. Therefore, after Christ preached to them, they believed and were saved. However, they are still detained in Tartarus until the coming day (2 Pet. 2:4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO WITNESSES</H2><P>Question: Are the two men in Revelation 11 two of the three from among Elijah, Enoch, and Moses? If so, will they be changed the same way as that which is described in 1 Corinthians 15? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: Maybe. There is no clear Scripture telling us that Enoch was changed. Elijah was taken up to heaven with his garment (see 2 Kings 2:13); it seems that he did not change either. When the Lord resurrected, did He not leave the linen in the tomb (John 20)? On the mount of transfiguration, they did not shine as the Lord did.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY OF MOSES</H2><P>Question: Will Moses have a body of resurrection? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: No. He only has a "soulish body." In Luke 16 we see that after the body dies, one still has eyes (v. 23) and a tongue (v. 24). These are parts of the "soulish body." (The two preachers in Revelation 11 are two of the three. According to my knowledge, when the Lord was on earth, He raised up three persons from the dead. Do not these three die again later? Perhaps between resurrection and a changed body, there will still be a temporary separation [death]. Nevertheless, after 1 Corinthians 15:52, they will surely be in incorruption and immortality. But there are differences as to the other experiences.</P><P>Although Enoch and Elijah were taken up, they did not reach heaven (John 3:13). It is possible that their body was not totally a body of flesh. It may be that they only possessed the kind of body like the three who were resurrected by the Lord had.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 SAMUEL 20:25 AND 34</H2><P>Question: Is there a difference in time between 1 Samuel 20:25 and 34? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: There is no difference in time. Both are in the past tense. Perhaps on the first day Jonathan stood, while on the second day, he sat at the table and hence "arose."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JUDGES 14:15 AND 17</H2><P>Question: How do you reconcile Judges 14:15 with verse 17?</P><P>Answer: Judges 14:15 should be "it came to pass on the fourth day." The internal proof is as follows: verse 14 says, "they could not in three days expound the riddle." Therefore, this must be the fourth day. Otherwise, verse 14 should say, "they could not in six days expound the riddle." The external proof is that both the Septuagint and the Syriac versions say "the fourth day." This is an error in the manuscript and does not affect the divine inspiration in any way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE VIRGIN IN ISAIAH 7:14</H2><P>Question: Some have said that "the virgin" in Isaiah 7:14 can be translated woman. Is this true? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: Virgin in Hebrew is ha-almah. In the New Testament, the Greek word is parthenos. Isaiah was written in Hebrew. The root of this word came from alam, which means hidden, enclosed in the inner chamber; therefore, it means a virgin. This word is used in the Old Testament seven times (Gen. 24:43; Exo. 2:8; Psa. 68:25; Prov. 30:19; S.S. 1:3; 6:8; Isa. 7:14). Although there is another word more specific than this one, betulah, that word can mean either a young girl or a virgin. (The above is quoted from Wordsworth's Companion Bible.) In Hebrew the word ha refers to something unique and is a definite article. Therefore, Isaiah 7:14 clearly says that it is a virgin. Although the Jews consider Matthew wrong in translating Isaiah 7:14 to be parthenos, yet the Septuagint was translated by the Jews themselves, and the Greek Old Testament also translated this word as parthenos.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><P>All questions regarding the Bible and spiritual matters can be directed to the editor. We will do our best to answer them. However, we will not respond to fruitless questions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Question: How should we explain the Trinity? Is there one God, or are there three Gods? (Rue, Hangchow)</P><P>Answer: God is triune. Although the word triune is not found in the Bible, this is definitely a major teaching in the Bible. The Bible testifies everywhere that the Father is God (2 Tim. 1:2, etc.). The Bible also attests that the Son is God. Hebrews 1:8 says, "Of the Son, `Your throne, O God, is forever and ever....'" This shows us clearly that the Son is God. John 1:1 says clearly that "the Word was God." The Lord Jesus Himself also said, "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30). We can see from the Holy Spirit's source and work that He is also God. Moreover, the Bible says explicitly that the Holy Spirit is God. Acts 5:3-4 says, "But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit...? You have not lied to men but to God." From the above verses we can see that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is also God. Then why do we say that He is the Triune God? First Timothy 2:5 says, "For there is one God." There is one God. Yet the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all God. Since there are not three gods, there must be a Triune God. This conclusion does not contradict the biblical teaching of one God, nor does it annul the divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit. It is the most scriptural expression. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is most mysterious, and we can only know about it without understanding it. We should remain quietly before Him and meditate on His greatness, rather than trying in vain to understand what God has not revealed to us (Deut. 29:29). (Note: It is better to say the Triune God than to say the Trinity.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK</H2><P>Question: Daniel 9:24 mentions the seventy weeks. Verse 25 of chapter nine mentions the seven weeks and the sixty-two weeks. Does the "middle of the week" in 9:27 refer to the tribulation, or does it refer to the Savior's time on earth? (Rue, Hangchow)</P><P>Answer: The seventy weeks in Daniel 9:24 cover a span of 490 years. These seventy weeks are divided into three periods. (1) The seven weeks, which is 49 years. This refers to the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem. (2) The next 62 weeks, which together with the first seven weeks is 483 years. This means that from the time of the decree for the rebuilding of the city until the death of Christ is 483 years. (This has fully been fulfilled. The decree for the rebuilding of the city [Ezra 1:1-2] was in 454 B.C., while the Lord's death was in A.D. 29. The two added together equal exactly 483 years.) (3) The last week, which is seven years. Originally, this week was immediately after the 483 years. But there is an insertion of the age of grace. Hence, the fulfillment of this week will take place when the tribulation comes at the end of this age. In order to determine if the "middle of the week" refers to the tribulation or to the time of our Savior on earth, we have to see who the "he" refers to in 9:27. If it refers to Antichrist, then the "middle of the week" has to refer to the tribulation. If the "he" refers to Christ, then the "middle of the week" has to refer to the time of our Savior on earth. In verse 26 we see two persons: Christ as the Messiah and Antichrist as the prince. Who does the "he" in verse 27 refer to? The "prince" is mentioned after the "Messiah," and since the "he" comes after the "prince," this "he" must refer to Antichrist. Hence, the "middle of the week" has to refer to the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ORIGIN OF SATAN</H2><P>Question: Where did Satan come from?</P><P>Answer: Satan was an angel. Through his pride, he wanted to become equal with God. As a result, he was rejected by God. Please read Ezekiel 28:11-19 and Isaiah 14:12-14. Both the king of Tyre and Lucifer refer to Satan. Pride has destroyed Satan, and it is still destroying many other people. What a pity!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF MAN</H2><P>Question: After Adam was driven out of the garden, his spirit had lost its function and was no longer able to have intimate fellowship with God. But he had not forgotten the Lord, for in Genesis 4:1 it says, "I have gotten a man from the Lord." Was that a mere inspiration? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: Yes. Although the spirit of Adam had lost its function and could no longer fellowship with God, his soul was still active and could remember the Lord. (Remembering is a function of the mind, and the mind is a part of the soul.) Not only is this true with Adam, but it is true with the few generations after Adam also. The endings "-el" and "-ah" in Mehujael and Methuselah both mean God in the original language. The same thing is true with modern man; the spirit of many backsliding believers has long ceased functioning. Their sins have stopped them from having any fellowship with God. Yet in their mouth and in their mind, they still remember the Lord. Of course, the memory of the Lord in our soul will not help us to have fellowship with God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH</H2><P>Question: What does the church in Matthew 18:17 refer to? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: In the four Gospels, only Matthew mentions the church. The Gospel of Matthew mentions the church twice, both of which are words spoken by our blessed Lord. One is in 16:18, and the other in 18:17. There are two biblical meanings for the word church: (1) The church that is composed of all those redeemed by the precious blood of the Lord. The Bible calls this the Body of Christ. (2) The believers in every place being gathered together to become the church in that place; for example, there is the church in Corinth, and there are the churches in Galatia. The first meaning refers to the universal church, whereas the second refers the local church as part of the universal church. (The present denominational churches are not scriptural churches. No doubt they are not the universal church, nor are they local churches, because the biblical local churches are called the churches in certain localities and do not have the names of different denominations or man-made administrations.)</P><P>The two mentions of the church in Matthew bear these two meanings. Verse 18 of chapter sixteen refers to the universal church, whereas 18:17 refers to the local church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RAPTURE OF THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>Question: Is the rapture of the church before or after the seven trumpets and the seven bowls? In 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 there is the mentioning of the rapture of the church. In Revelation 8, 9, and 11:15 there is the mentioning of the seven trumpets, and in Revelation 15 and 16 there is the mentioning of the seven bowls. What is the order of these events? Which one comes first, and which one next? I would like you to help me concerning this. In discussing this issue, some people have placed the seven trumpets and the seven bowls after 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17! But according to the diagram that you have put out, you have clearly put the seven trumpets and seven bowls in Revelation 8 and 9 and 11:15 with chapters sixteen and seventeen before 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. I am really confused and would like you to help me. (Chow, Meng Tse)</P><P>Answer: To discuss this problem in detail is beyond the scope of this paper. Here you must forgive me for only mentioning it in brief. The expression "the rapture of the church" is not scriptural. The Bible never uses this term. A wrong term will lead to a wrong teaching. (The word church used here only refers to the real church, composed of those who are genuinely saved.) The Bible never says that the whole church (the real one) will be raptured. If that were the Lord's intention, He would surely mention "the rapture of the church" at least once in the Bible. But there is no such mentioning, which shows that there is no such thing as the whole "church" being "raptured."</P><P>In my diagram, what I wanted to show was that there will be two raptures of the saints. Those saints who are saved and overcoming will be raptured to the air before the tribulation. Those saints who are only saved but not overcoming will be tried in the tribulation, and they will be raptured to the air only after they have matured. One rapture takes place at the beginning of the tribulation, and the other takes place at the end of the tribulation. That diagram only covers the rapture in 1 Thessalonians and how it is related to the seven trumpets; it does not cover the seven bowls. For the sake of clarity, perhaps I will explain it nevertheless. First let us consider the seven trumpets and the seven bowls. The first six trumpets have nothing to do with the seven bowls. Let us look at the seventh trumpet: "And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ" (Rev. 11:15). The kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ is the millennium. Hence, it is clear that as soon as the seventh trumpet is sounded, the millennium will be here. But what about the seven bowls? If the millennium comes as soon as the seventh trumpet is sounded, surely the seven bowls cannot come after the seventh trumpet. Hence, the seven bowls must not follow sequentially after the seventh trumpet. The wrath of the seven bowls is merely an addition to the previous judgments; they do not occupy much place in the history of Revelation. One cannot say definitely when the seven bowls will occur; they are there mainly as a supplement to the other tribulations.</P><P>Next, let us consider the rapture. We have already mentioned that there are two raptures for the church, one taking place at the beginning of the tribulation, and the other at the end of the tribulation. All prophecy scholars agree that 1 Thessalonians 4:16 will occur at the same time as 1 Corinthians 15:52. First Corinthians 15 clearly mentions "the last trumpet." If 1 Thessalonians 4 and 1 Corinthians 15 will occur before the seventh trumpet, how can there be another blowing of the seventh trumpet after "the last trumpet" ? Hence, at least we have to identify "the last trumpet" as the seventh trumpet. In this way, the rapture in 1 Thessalonians and 1 Corinthians must occur at the time of the sounding of the seventh trumpet, that is, toward the end of the tribulation. My answer therefore is that the timing of the seven bowls is not fixed. (Nevertheless, they will occur around the time of the seventh trumpet.) The rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4 occurs at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, which is at the end of the tribulation. The rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4 is the second rapture of the believers. The first rapture will take place before the tribulation.</P><P>Therefore, although we are saved, we must still be watchful and prepared, and we should not be entangled with the anxieties of this life. Otherwise, we will pass through the tribulation and will suffer, contrary to the Lord's desire. A farmer will not reap an unripe harvest, and Christ will not rapture the unsanctified believers. (The Lord willing, we will have a detailed study on the question of the rapture in the future. Here we are only giving the conclusion; this is not a detailed analysis.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GIFTS</H2><P>Question: According to James 1:17, the heavenly Father never gives any gift of imperfection. But in reality, He has granted many believing brothers some imperfections, which benefit the weaker believers. Is this not also a great gift from the heavenly Father? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: James 1:17 says that the gifts from the heavenly Father are perfect in themselves. Although God has given many servants to His church (Eph. 4:11), I do not consider it a great gift of God to the church that some brothers become a "benefit" to other believers. Such brothers are merely used by God to bring benefit to others. They may become a means for God to bestow gifts to others, but they themselves are not the gifts of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SINFUL NATURE IN THE SAINTS</H2><P>Question: Does 1 John 1:8 refer both to the believers and to the apostle John as well? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: Yes. "Sin" refers to the sinful nature. Although believers have been regenerated and have the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4), they still possess a sinful nature. John said that he who says that he does not have a sinful nature any longer is deceiving himself. At present, there is a kind of holiness teaching that tells people that the sinful nature can be eradicated. This is most dangerous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SINNING IN THE CASE<br>OF THE REGENERATED BELIEVERS</H2><P>Question: Does 1 John 3:9 say that a regenerated believer cannot sin? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: A regenerated believer can sin, but he does not have to sin, and he should not sin. It is the experience of all the believers that they do sin. There are two phrases that we should pay attention to: "does not practice sin" in the first half of the verse, and "cannot sin" in the second half of the verse. In the original language, "does not sin" means that one does not continue in sin, or that one does not consider it his occupation to sin. Hence, the first half of this verse means that a regenerated believer does not continue unceasingly in sin, or that a regenerated believer does not make it his occupation to sin. In the same way, the second half of the verse should be read, "does not continue in sin." Therefore, John is not saying that it is impossible for a regenerated person to sin. Rather, he is saying that a regenerated person does not continue in sin. When he falls accidentally, he goes immediately to God to confess his sins and trusts in the Lord as his Mediator. Otherwise, what could John have meant when he said, "If anyone sins, we have an Advocate [not a Savior, for a Savior is in relation to sinners] with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous" (2:1)?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMPELLING</H2><P>Question: What does Matthew 5:41 mean? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: The context of this portion of the Word clearly shows that the Lord Jesus was teaching us not to oppose others-"not to resist him who is evil." Verses 36 to 42 are merely giving us a few examples. A saint living in this world should not oppose others for any reason (except when he is being forced to sin). When describing the unreasonableness of men, the Lord Jesus said that if others compel you to go a mile, you should go with them two. The present-day rickshaw drivers can be a real test to the believers. Unfortunately, many people have forgotten about the second mile in their daily lives!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHANGING WATER INTO WINE<br>IN CANA</H2><P>Question: Can it be that the wine that was changed in John 2:3-9 was a kind of harmless wine? Please explain this sign. (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: Perhaps it was grape wine. But if it were consumed in great quantity, it would also be harmful. However, since it was a wine recently changed and it was new, it should not have been harmful. The Lord never forbids the drinking of wine. But at the same time, He was never drunk. This sign is significant in many ways. We will enumerate them briefly. In type, wine signifies joy (Psa. 104:15; Judg. 9:13). To be without wine is to be in the failure of the dispensation of the law; there is no joy of salvation, and there is no joy to God. The Lord's mother represents the nation of Israel, who wanted Him to manifest His outward glory. The Lord rejected her and gave the new wine (the gospel) to others. In prophecy, this sign describes the condition of the Lord Jesus in the millennium. In John 1, there are three "next days"; hence, there were four days already. Verse one of this chapter says "the third day," which means that this sign was done on the seventh day. The seventh day at the time of creation was a type of the coming millennium (Heb. 4). By that time, God will marry the Israelites. Although they have failed, God will be gracious to them. And Christ will manifest His glory. In teaching, we see how Mary was rebuked for not waiting on the Lord's timing, how the servants were completely obedient, how the Lord changes those whose hearts are as hard as stone and fills them with blessing, how the world first rejoices and then suffers, but how the believers first suffer and then rejoice. All these are beautiful lessons.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONFESSION</H2><P>Question: What does Psalm 51:4 mean when it says, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned"? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: This psalm is David's confession of his sin of adultery with Bathsheba. Although he had sinned against Uriah, and although he had sinned against Bathsheba, his deep regret before God caused him to consider the way he had grieved God and fallen short of His glory. In such deep self remorse and regret, he considered that he had sinned against God Himself. It is a pity that believers today for the most part are sorry for themselves and do not have such a contrite spirit! If a man does not weep after he sins, he will probably sin again.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN CUTTING THEIR HAIR</H2><P>Question: Is it scriptural for a woman to cut her hair? (Ho, Foochow)</P><P>Answer: No, it is not. First Corinthians 11:2-16 gives two reasons: (1) long hair is the glory of a woman, and (2) it is a sign of submission to authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SELF-EXALTATION</H2><P>Question: How does one explain Matthew 23:9 and 10? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: In order to understand the Bible, we have to read the context. Here, prior to these verses, the Lord was rebuking the scribes and the Pharisees, because they exalted themselves in the seat of Moses, but did not have any good works. Yet they wanted to be the leaders-to be called rabbis. After these verses, He said that we should humble ourselves and should be one another's servants. After reading the context of this passage, we will realize the intention of our beloved Lord. He does not mean that we should not call our physical father "father," or that teachers should not be called "teachers" by their students. This is not what the Lord means. The Lord points out clearly His reason for teaching this: "You are all brothers" (v. 8). "For One is your Father, He who is in the heavens" (v. 9). "Because One is your Instructor, the Christ" (v. 10). All these are spiritual relationships and have nothing to do with their titles according to the flesh. In considering the word brothers, we know that it concerns matters within the church; it does not concern fleshly matters outside the church. The Lord's teaching is twofold: one should not be called, and one should not call others. The Lord does not want us to follow the conduct of the Pharisees, who did many things only for the praise of men. We should not have any motive other than fulfilling our duty. Today the church behaves in just the same way as the Israelites did in the days of old! There is a group of people who stand between the heavenly Father and the brothers, who assume authority upon themselves. Actually, besides the Bible, the church has no authority of its own. It is a pity that God's children not only tolerate this kind of teaching, but promote it as well. In the Lord's eyes, everyone in the church is His child, and there is no distinction of class. It is the poison of Catholicism to separate the "pastors" from the "laity." In reading the New Testament, we see that apostles and shepherds are only gifts of God (Eph. 4:11). A gift has no authority attached to it; its only function is to build up the brothers. Although there were such things as excommunications in the apostolic churches, such matters belonged to the whole Body (1 Cor. 5:13) and were unlike today's hierarchical practices. As to Timothy's receiving of Paul's charges, his rebukes and exhortations, they were all the exercise of personal gifts. We should make a clear distinction between gift and hierarchy. The former is what God is after, whereas the latter is what man has created. When the voice of the church becomes too loud, God's word is seldom consulted. We should realize that before God we are all equal. Hence, all those who desire to uplift themselves are disobeying the command of the Lord and will be humbled (Matt. 23:12). It is a pity that many people have disobeyed the instructions in these two verses because they do not understand the teaching of the Bible! Yet, God's children should realize that not only is God not happy with our receiving titles from others, but He is also not happy that we address others with any title.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RISING OF THE MORNING STAR</H2><P>Question: How does one explain the second half of 2 Peter 1:19? (Chung, Shanghai)</P><P>Answer: This verse is difficult to understand according to the present punctuation. How can the morning star rise in our hearts? If we look at the punctuation and order of phrases in the translations of two great Bible scholars, Tregelles and F. W. Grant, the meaning will be apparent. "And we have the prophetic word made more firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts" (2 Pet. 1:19). The morning star does not rise in the believers' hearts. Instead, the believers should give heed to the prophetic word in their hearts.

In verse 37, it refers to the righteous. Who are these righteous ones? (Chang, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: These righteous ones are, of course, different from us today who have become righteous by believing in the Lord. By that time, the Lord Jesus will have already come to earth (vv. 31-32). Therefore, it will be a period of time after the seven years and before the thousand years; the age of grace will be over. God will deal with the world in the same way that He dealt with Israel in the Old Testament. The righteousness here, therefore, does not refer to our present righteousness, which is obtained by grace. The Lord calls them the righteous because they have treated the Jews ("one of these, the least of My brothers") kindly. Their being called righteous is to differentiate them from the cursed ones. The principle of this judgment follows Genesis 12:3, 27:29, and Numbers 24:5, 9, and 14. Please read Psalm 37:10-11 and 21-22 and compare with Matthew 5:5.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN TEACHING</H2><P>Question: In 1 Corinthians 14:34 and the verses after that, and in 1 Timothy 2:12, Paul says that the women are not permitted to speak or to teach in the churches. Should women be permitted to teach in the churches? (Chang, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: The Bible says they should not.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN THE BAPTIST</H2><P>Question: Before John the Baptist was born, he leaped in his mother's womb when his mother saw Mary. He later proclaimed many times that the Lord Jesus was the Lamb of God. When the Lord Jesus was baptized, John said that the heavens opened and the Spirit descended. He even heard God's own testimony. If so, why would he not know who the Lord Jesus was? Why did he send his disciples when he was in prison to ask who the Lord Jesus was? (Kang, Honan)</P><P>Answer: This event was recorded in Matthew 11:1-19. From the answer given by the Lord Jesus, we know that the faith of John the Baptist was weakened at that time. The answer of the Lord is in verses 4 through 6. At the end of His answer, the Lord said, "And blessed is he who is not stumbled because of Me." For John to ask such a question meant that he was stumbled by the Lord Jesus. What does this mean? John the Baptist was the forerunner of Christ. He was the last of the Old Testament prophets. Like all the other Old Testament prophets, he did not understand many of the things he preached. He was a Jew, and he could not help but be influenced by the hope of the Jews of that time, that the Messiah would be a king. Thus, when he preached that the kingdom of the heavens was at hand, he thought that the Lord Jesus was going to be a physical king on this earth. He had high hopes in the physical things, because he was the forerunner of Christ. He did not realize that the kingdom of the heavens has two stages: first the spiritual stage (in which Christ was despised by the world) and then the manifested stage (at which time Christ will be honored and worshipped by the world). The Christ that he testified of was not what he hoped He would be. This Christ did not emerge to establish a manifested kingdom, but instead He traveled all over to preach and to heal. He acted as if He had no ambition to be a king! In the meantime, John was imprisoned, and his own life was in great danger! As a result, his faith was shaken; he questioned whether the Lord Jesus was indeed the Christ. If He was, why did He fail to match his expectation? (Often, we are the same way.) He, therefore, sent his disciples to question the Lord Jesus. In essence, the Lord gave His answer as follows: "You should know who I am from the things that I have said and done (v. 4). You should not be stumbled just because My works are lowly and do not match your expectation. The Messiah must first suffer and then enter into His glory." May our hearts not be stumbled because Christ was despised.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SHEEPFOLD AND THE DOORKEEPER</H2><P>Question: John 10 speaks of the sheepfold and the doorkeeper. To what do they refer? (Chi, Foochow)</P><P>Answer: The sheepfold is the sphere of Judaism. The doorkeeper is the Holy Spirit. Enters through the door means that the Lord Jesus came according to the law and the prophecies of the prophets. To him the doorkeeper opens refers to the Holy Spirit opening the door for Him to meet the Jews whom He should meet. Leads them out means that He brings the Jews who believed in Him out of Judaism. And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold refers to the believers who are Gentiles. There shall be one flock means that the Jews and the Gentiles will become one church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TO BELIEVE BEING TO BE SAVED</H2><P>Question: What is the meaning of Romans 10:6-7? (Lin, Fukien)</P><P>Answer: In verse 6, " `Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down" means that Christ was born to suffer death. In verse 7, " `Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead" refers to Christ's resurrection from the dead. These two verses convey the meaning that both Christ's birth for the suffering of death and Christ's resurrection from the dead are acts of God. These works have all been accomplished. The Lord Jesus has already come to the earth, has already been crucified on the cross, and has already resurrected. Sinners do not need to prepare a savior for themselves. God has accomplished everything for men. "God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering" (Gen. 22:8). Men do not have to worry. If you are willing to believe all that has been done, you will be justified. "But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, `Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?' that is, to bring Christ down; or, `Who will descend into the abyss?' that is, to bring Christ up from the dead."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HOLY SPIRIT AND CORNELIUS</H2><P>Question: Dear Sir, I have received The Work of the Holy Spirit and Where Is Heaven? In both books the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and the Holy Spirit's falling upon the household of Cornelius are considered to be of the same kind. I do not consider this to be an appropriate assessment, for on the day of Pentecost the one hundred twenty men had had three years of education under the Lord. They had long been "born anew in the Holy Spirit." After the resurrection, they had even received the "Holy Spirit Himself." It was at the moment when they needed the power of the Holy Spirit to work for the Lord that the Holy Spirit came and provided the timely baptism so that the Father's promise could be fulfilled. But in Cornelius's case, even though he feared God, he was outside of the Lord's salvation. How could he possibly omit the process and advance into the same experience as those who were there on the day of Pentecost? Even if Cornelius and his household (Acts 10:2) were prepared in advance, how could the rest of his "relatives and intimate friends" (v. 24) as well as "all those hearing the word" (v. 44) be prepared also? I do not find that reasonable. Therefore, Acts 11:15, "the Holy Spirit fell on them just as also on us in the beginning" must refer to Peter's initial experience of regeneration by the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, Acts 11:17 says, "...have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ." It is inconceivable that Peter did not believe on the Lord Jesus Christ until the day of Pentecost. In verse 18 those who heard these things also agreed that the Holy Spirit who fell upon the household of Cornelius was the Holy Spirit who gives "repentance unto life." In conclusion, what Cornelius had was obviously the initial step of regeneration by the Holy Spirit. I wonder if my ignorant view is accurate? (Song, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: I am extremely reluctant to argue with God's children on any given issue. Concerning the work of the Holy Spirit, the most significant point is to see it in three stages: regeneration, sanctification, and empowering. The central focus of those two books is to show young Christians the different steps of the work of the Holy Spirit so that they would have the way to seek after the Holy Spirit. If we can truly experience His regeneration, sanctification, and empowering, we are fully satisfied already. It is of little significance to investigate the fine point as to what step of the work of the Holy Spirit was received by the household of Cornelius. We should feel free to believe, but not to debate.</P><P>I realize that you have no intention to debate. However, we still must be cautious to not develop any distance between ourselves. If we hold this view, we will perhaps escape being used by an evil spirit. With this in mind, we can have a careful discussion. What the household of Cornelius received was indeed the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Here are the reasons: (1) "The Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word" (Acts 10:44); (2) "On the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out" (v. 45); (3) they "received the Holy Spirit" (v. 47); (4) Peter referred to it as "baptized in the Holy Spirit" (11:16); (5) he referred to it also as God's "gift" (v. 17). All these descriptions fit the condition for the baptism of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. These expressions are not used to describe regeneration or the work of sanctification; they are used to describe the baptism of the Holy Spirit. If you compare the conditions at the household of Cornelius and on the day of Pentecost, you will find that the two are the same. (Compare 10:44 and 1:8; 10:45 and 2:17, 33; 10:37 and 2:4; 11:16 and 1:5; 11:17 and 2:38.) The results of both cases were also the same-speaking in tongues (Acts 2:4 and 10:46). When Peter used the phrase in the beginning in Acts 11:15, he was clearly referring to the day of Pentecost. If you note the words "fell on" in the same verse and read them together with verses 16 and 17, you will see that Peter was referring to the day of Pentecost. "As also to us who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ" in verse 17 has two meanings: (1) Here, it says, "the Lord Jesus Christ," not simply "Jesus." This is the full title of the Lord. On the day of resurrection and before Pentecost, the disciples had already believed in the Lord, yet they were somewhat unclear; to them, many things were not fully understood. (This is what we see in the four Gospels.) Possibly, it was not until the day of Pentecost that they fully understood and believed. For that reason, Peter did not say, "Believed on Jesus," but rather he said, "Believed on the Lord Jesus Christ." (2) Peter was speaking to the circumcised disciples (Acts 11:2) about the Holy Spirit whom they had received on the day of Pentecost through repentance. What was received by the household of Cornelius was indeed the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But in their actual experience, they had repented and received life. To say that Cornelius was regenerated is right as far as his experience is concerned. However, as far as the fact is concerned, what Cornelius received was the baptism of the Holy Spirit. When I wrote The Work of the Holy Spirit, I purposely added a few footnotes on the last page to explain the case of Cornelius, for fear that the reader would not understand this point. Because of the limited space and the need to further discuss the issues of the Holy Spirit, I had to make the footnotes brief. As a result, the over-simplified footnotes have caused much misunderstanding. In recent days God has added much light to me, and I will take the opportunity while such a question is raised to say a further word.</P><P>We must distinguish clearly between two things: God's facts and man's experience. God's facts include all that God has accomplished for man, such as the salvation of the cross and the advent of the Holy Spirit. Man's experience is the affirmation of what God has done for him through his own experience. According to God's fact, every single believer possesses the baptism of the Holy Spirit. However, according to man's experience, not all have this experience. According to 1 Corinthians 12:13, when all the believers were regenerated, they were all baptized into the Holy Spirit-this is God's fact. But according to the believers' experience, this is not altogether true. The baptism of the Holy Spirit at Cornelius's house opened the Gentiles' door; it is a fact that God accomplished it for all the Gentile believers then and now. God chose the household of Cornelius to accomplish this fact because they had the best preparation. You were correct to say that Cornelius was at that time only regenerated (experientially). Yet, at that very same moment, as 1 Corinthians 12:13 says, the Holy Spirit baptized him and his household into the Body of Christ. Therefore, we can see that, as far as the fact is concerned, the incident at the house of Cornelius was the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But as far as their experience was concerned, they were only regenerated. The reason I pointed out in the footnotes that the experience in Cornelius's house was a "special experience" was that there was the speaking in tongues, which was, of course, an experience. After spending much time before the Lord, I realized that the case of Cornelius's household was special for the reason that at that time (as it was at Pentecost) God accomplished for the church the fact of the baptism of the Holy Spirit as well as regenerating them. Of course, in actuality, this was not too special, because when we are regenerated, we are at the same time baptized into the Body of Christ just as Cornelius was. May the Lord grant us the desire to be sanctified and to be empowered! May we gain more of Him.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><P>All who have biblical and spiritual questions may write to the editor.

At that time, they will still have the flesh and will not be free from weaknesses. This is why the leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations." What is the scriptural basis for such an interpretation? (Wang, Peking)</P><P>Answer: There are two ways to interpret the Bible. The first is by clear proofs in the Bible; the second is by the clues in the Bible. In this case, we have to consider the clues in the Bible. Revelation 21:3-7 divides the people in the new heaven and the new earth into two kinds: peoples and sons. According to verse 3, peoples means ordinary people of the world, who are the nations in verse 24. Sons are the people in the church, because only those in the church receive the spring of the water of life and overcome. (Compare this with the overcoming in chapters two and three.) From reading Matthew 25:31-46, we know that the sheep in the nations will be in the millennium. After reading the prophecies of the Old Testament prophets, we know that in the millennium both the Jews and the nations will still be in the flesh (because they will still have birth and death and so forth). After the millennium, the Bible records that there will be no death in the new heaven and the new earth (Rev. 21:4). However, the Bible does not say that the bodies of the people of the nations will be changed. The Bible only says that when the Lord receives the saints, the saints will have their bodies changed (Phil. 3:20-21; 1 Thes. 4:16-17; 1 Cor. 15:52). The people of the nations do not have this promise. Therefore, when they enter the new earth, they must still have the flesh. Since they still have the flesh, they also have weaknesses. This is why the Word of God says, "And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations" (Rev. 22:2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A BURDEN IN THE HEART</H2><P>Question: Please answer this one question for me. The year before last, in a revival meeting I received the Holy Spirit who operates in my heart for His work. The day before that day, He led me to cry out loudly for forgiveness. I confessed many sins before many people. The next day, after listening to a speaker talking on the joy of receiving the forgiveness of sins, I prayed and thanked the heavenly Father for His great mercy. Suddenly, I became uncontrollably happy and could not stop laughing. In the evening, after a bath, during the evening prayer, I suddenly had a special sensation: I felt a soothing feeling as if I had received the ointment of joy, and I was full of happiness. This happiness did not leave me no matter where I went and what I saw. (Though I do not feel this happiness now, peace is still always with me.) Since then, there has been a great change in my heart. There often is a "gust of air" in my heart seeking release. Sometimes I feel that it is hard to release this air. At other times I feel at ease to release it. When I feel at ease to release it, the feeling of ease is like saying "Amen." This, I believe, is the fulfillment of Romans 8:23 or 24. (When I pray, I am more released.) But some say that this is a sign of the dissatisfaction of the heart and spirit. Others say this is the grieving of the Holy Spirit. But I still believe that I am right. In spite of this, I would like to ask you about it.</P><P>Answer: My dear Mr. Fu-Ho in the Lord, peace to you! I received your letter. May God Himself lead you in His grace! What you call "a gust of air" is just a kind of heavy feeling that a believer often experiences. This heavy feeling can come from one of two sources. One is from the Holy Spirit, and it is called a "burden"; the other is from Satan and is called a "weight." When the Holy Spirit gives us this heavy feeling, He is giving us a burden in our heart. This is with two purposes: (1) that we would preach the gospel, and (2) that we would pray for others. After you have preached what He wants you to preach, He will remove this heavy feeling from you. After you have prayed what He wants you to pray, He will also remove this heavy feeling from you, and you will feel as if the air has been released from you. But if He wants you to continue to pray for a certain person or a certain matter, He will cause this heavy feeling to remain in you. Saints who have this kind of experience are beginning to experience co-working with the Lord. Heavy feelings may also come from Satan. A weight from Satan is not like a burden given by the Holy Spirit. What Satan gives is a kind of pressure, putting the saints under an indescribable oppression, making them sad for no reason at all. When Satan oppresses the saints, they feel uneasy either sitting up or lying down. They do not feel right either to walk or to stop, to speak or to be quiet. They do not feel right either to pray or to read the Bible. It seems as if they are lost as to what to do; the heart is depressed and impatient, as if there is an unspeakable, indescribable oppression. It seems as if the heart is being tied down by some mysterious force-what you perhaps would call "the gust of air." Because your letter was short, I cannot say for certain whether your heavy feeling is from Satan or from the Holy Spirit. However, you should try to differentiate between the two. The heavy feeling from the Holy Spirit is with a purpose; it causes us to be concerned for certain persons or certain matters, to pray for them, or to preach the Lord's gospel to them. Satan's heavy feeling is not like this. It comes when you are unaware. It makes you feel grievous suddenly and for no reason at all. Satan takes you as his target; he has no other aim except to disturb you. The heavy feeling from the Holy Spirit is with a purpose; He lets you know what it is that you are burdened for. The heavy feeling from Satan is purposeless. It leaves you feeling lost, and wondering why you feel this way. Therefore, if your heavy feeling is from the Holy Spirit, you should cooperate with the Lord faithfully and should not mind the flesh. If it is from Satan, you should (1) recognize that it comes from Satan, (2) be resolved not to be oppressed by it, and (3) resist him by prayer or by calling. The best way of resistance is first to invoke the victory of the cross and then to speak audibly, "The precious blood of the Lord covers me." "I will not be oppressed by the enemy." "Satan, get away from me quickly." "Hallelujah, the Lord has won the victory," and so forth. Sunshine will break through the darkened, cloudy sky. Please write again and let me know how you are doing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LENDING MONEY FOR INTEREST</H2><P>Question: How should we interpret the parable in Matthew 25:27? (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: The talents in this parable are the gifts of the Holy Spirit. "Deposited my money with the money changers" (v. 27) means to pass on to one or two people the gift you have received from the Holy Spirit and to let them work, so that you can receive some interest indirectly. When the Lord comes back, you can recover "what is [the Lord's] with interest."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CORPSE</H2><P>Question: What does Matthew 24:28 refer to? (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: At the time of the great tribulation, Christ will be in the air, while Antichrist will be on the earth. The two will be at a standoff with one facing the other. The saints will be taken to the Lord. Hence, the Body of Christ will be united with Christ in the air. Antichrist also has his followers; they will be united with him on earth and will become his corpse, because they are men dead in sins. This will stand in opposition to the Body of Christ. These two will also be at a standoff with one facing the other. The vultures signify sin or judgment. Where the followers of Antichrist will be, there will be sin and judgment also.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JUSTIFICATION BY WORKS IN JAMES</H2><P>Question: Are Ephesians 2:8 and James 2:14 talking about two separate things: one about saving ourselves, and the other about saving others? If both refer to the same thing, are they not contradictory? Please correct me. (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: Ephesians 2:8 and James 2:14 are both about ourselves. We are saved through faith. This is proven by the entire Bible without controversy. But we should know that the justification that Paul speaks of is different from the justification that James speaks of. We have received two justifications. Paul in Romans 4 speaks of the truth of justification by faith, whereas James in James 2 speaks of the reason for justification by works. One thing can be used as a key to understand these two justifications: the history of Abraham as quoted by both Paul and James. Paul's quote of Abraham's history in Romans 4 was for proving the truth of justification by faith, and it is recorded in Genesis 15, whereas James' quote of Abraham's history in James 2 was for proving the reason for justification by works, and it is recorded in Genesis 22. Paul talked about the time before Abraham had a son, when he believed that God would give him a son. James talked about Abraham's obedience to God in offering Isaac as an offering. Abraham's first justification lies in his faith in God giving a son. His second justification lies in his offering of Isaac. Abraham was justified twice; so are the believers. We are first justified by faith, and then we are justified by works. Unfortunately, many Christians only receive the first justification. However, to fail in the second justification does not mean that a person has lost the first justification. The first justification depends entirely on the Lord Jesus. The second justification is obtained after receiving the first justification through appropriating the Lord's good works. In Romans 4 and Ephesians 2, Paul annulled work entirely. James in his Epistle emphasized both faith and works; he never annulled faith. From this we see that faith is the foundation of justification. Furthermore, the salvation and justification mentioned in James 2:14 are not justification and salvation before God. What this verse is saying is that in man's eyes, without good works, a Christian will not be considered righteous even if he attributes everything to faith in God. Please read verse 18. James did not say that God will not save or justify, because as soon as a person believes in the Lord Jesus, God will save him and justify him (Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 3:22, 24, 28; 4:4-5). However, the world will criticize such a person's faith (James 2:18). Hence, James 2 is merely telling us man's view. The purpose of James' Epistle is to exhort people to " become doers of the word and not hearers only " (1:22). Furthermore, what he mentioned was merely a man's evaluation. Hence, words such as "Can that faith save him?" "Faith...is dead," and so forth, refer only to what people see in a believer and to the result of truth in man's eyes. They do not refer to the soul. We should know that we are first saved, then we perform good works. We do not perform good works first and then become saved. After we are saved, we spontaneously perform good works. But those who merely perform good works will never be saved. "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved" (Acts 16:31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TEMPTATION</H2><P>Question: The devil tempted Adam by using a snake. But in Matthew 4:1-2 what did the devil use to tempt the Lord Jesus? (Wu, Kiangsi)</P><P>Answer: Satan has not the slightest place in the Lord Jesus (John 14:30). Hence, he could not tempt the Lord Jesus the same way he tempts us. He probably appeared in person when tempting Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION BY FAITH</H2><P>Question: If a person is not at all saved by works, and if faith is the only condition, why then were the people in Matthew 7:22-23 cast out? They preached and healed and must have known the Lord Jesus also. Paul said believing in the heart and confessing with the mouth brings in salvation. Why then are they cast out? (A son of repentance)</P><P>Answer: When we read the Gospels, the most important thing is to not confuse eternal life with the kingdom of the heavens. Eternal life is different from the kingdom of the heavens. The entire Gospel of John proves that eternal life is obtained by believing. The kingdom of the heavens is obtained by works (Matt. 11:12, etc.). Eternal life means that we are saved from perdition. The kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly portion of the millennium. (The earthly portion is for the Jews and the Gentiles.) The kingdom of the heavens is where the saints rule as kings with the Lord Jesus in the millennium. This is a prize to be gained through works. Those in Matthew 7:22-23 will not lose their eternal life, but they will lose the kingdom of the heavens; that is, they will not be able to rule with the Lord for a thousand years. The Lord said He did not know them, because at that time and place, He could not know them. This is like a judge whose son has broken the law. While he is judging his son, he cannot recognize him as his son. Workers of lawlessness in the original means "those who do not keep the law," or "lawless ones," or "those who do not act according to rules."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH</H2><P>Question: The slaves who received the talents seem to have received the grace of salvation already. Why were their talents taken away from them later when they did not gain any more, and why did they have to end up gnashing their teeth? It seems that eternal life is related to works. I would like very much to accept the word of justification by faith, but I would like to understand more about it. Please help me. (A son of repentance)</P><P>Answer: The talents in Matthew 25 refer to the gifts of the Holy Spirit and not to salvation, because there cannot be different grades of salvation implied by five talents, two talents, and one talent. Even though the slaves in Luke 19 all received a mina, if the first mina refers to salvation, then the minas that were gained should also refer to salvation. If so, how can you explain the ten minas and the five minas that were gained? Therefore, the talents cannot refer to salvation. They refer to gifts, because the gifts of the Holy Spirit can be increased by our working faithfully. These gifts were given to the disciples when the Lord Jesus departed from this world. What the slave loses is the gift of the Holy Spirit, not eternal life. Furthermore, we have to know that Matthew 25:14-30 and Luke 19:11-27 refer to the same judgment. There are four judgments recorded in the Bible: (1) the cross, which has passed; (2) the judgment in the air concerning the conduct of the believers; (3) the judgment on the earth concerning the nations; (4) the judgment of the great white throne for the resurrected dead people. The judgment mentioned here must be the second, the judgment in the air concerning the conduct of the believers. This judgment is covered in detail in 1 Corinthians 3. Verse 15 says that even though a believer's works shall be burnt, " he himself will be saved." Therefore, although that slave will lose the prize, he himself will still be saved. As to why there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, there are two reasons: (1) he sees that others have gained the Lord's heart, and (2) he has wrongly judged the Lord (Matt. 25:24). The destiny of this kind of slave is the outer darkness outside the cloud of glory in the air for a thousand years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOING INTO THE CAPITAL AND KEEPING THE FEAST</H2><P>Question: The Lord's brethren advised Him to go into the capital to keep the feast because it was an important occasion. The Lord answered that His time was not yet come and asked His brethren to go. Then He went up in secret. Why? (Pao, Nanking)</P><P>Answer: This verse is recorded in John 7. The Lord's brothers (1) did not believe in Him (v. 5), (2) were wrong in their advice (v. 4), and (3) did not really want the Lord to go into the capital to keep the feast, but were asking Him to make a show of Himself in the capital (v. 3). Therefore, the Lord did not listen to them. Moreover, the death of the Lord Jesus was according to an appointed date (Dan. 9:26). At that time, the Jews were looking for an opportunity to kill the Lord (John 7:1). If the Lord had not been careful, He would not have died on the cross, which was a Gentile method of punishment. The method of the Jews was stoning. His brothers thought that the Lord had no need to be afraid of the Jews and that He should take the feast as an opportunity to enter the capital and display His great talent. This was the urging of Satan, and our Lord did not take heed to it. Verse 10 gives other reasons. The Lord did not go in public; neither did He go in secret, but "as it were" in secret. He was careful, because the Jews could kill Him on the way up, thus keeping Him from reaching the capital and causing Luke 13:33 not to be fulfilled. He went later because (1) His time had arrived, (2) His brothers being gone, He could go alone quietly without being noticed, and (3) John wanted to show that He is God and that God cannot be directed or taught by man. Herein lies a lesson: The Lord knew that He should go into the capital, yet until the Father had instructed Him, He would wait for the right time. When He went to the capital, He did not do so because of His brothers' words, but because of the Father's commandment. We should learn from this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH</H2><P>Question: We advocate that there should not be denominations. This is very scriptural. But without large meetings, there will not be a general acquaintance with each other among the saints. Therefore, a suitable place, the organization, and other matters of the large meetings need to be discussed. (Pao, Nanking)</P><P>Answer: I am afraid the term denomination that you used will cause misunderstandings among many. Actually, what we advocate is not that there should be no denominations, but that there should be no sectarianism. Indeed, this is very scriptural. I have carefully read through the charters of every major denomination. I feel strongly that they have not shed all that was handed down from the Roman Catholic Church. Most of the rules and organizations in these churches are traditions from man and were created by man. The cardinal principle of Protestantism is that the church does not have any authority and that only the Bible has authority. But the work of the Reformation under Luther's hand did not reach perfection. Lazarus was resurrected, but his hands and feet were still bound by grave clothes, and his face was still bound about with a napkin! I, for one, believe the Bible with my whole heart. To me, the Bible is the highest court. Whatever is shown in the Bible, we do not have the slightest right to doubt, even a little. The Holy Spirit knows how the church should be organized. He has revealed the matter completely in the Scriptures. However, some in the church feel that the church organization revealed in the Bible is immature and that there should be a better and more complete organization in this age of progression. Actually, this is to follow the same road that the Roman Catholic Church has taken. These are but haughty people who despise the will of God. Today, the churches in China are in a transitional period. Many talk about indigenous churches, but to be indigenous without being scriptural is not the will of the Lord. What good is it simply to have an empty name of the "Church of Christ in China"? May the Lord make us faithful in this age of apostasy. (As to the organization of the church, please read the entire fourth issue of this paper.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE THIRD HEAVEN AND PARADISE</H2><P>Question: Please explain in detail 2 Corinthians 12:2-4. What is "in the body" and "outside the body"? (Pao, Naking)</P><P>Answer: Since the Bible does not state clearly, it is not definite whether Paul is talking about himself or others; but it is likely that he is talking about himself. Paul says that fourteen years ago this man was caught away to the third heaven and received extraordinary experiences. The expressions "in the body" and "outside the body" refer to Paul's uncertainty about whether this person's spirit went to heaven only, or the person went to heaven with his body. To be "in the body" means to be with the body; to be "outside the body" means to be in spirit only without the body. "Paradise" and the "third heaven" are two different things. Paradise is in Hades, at the center of the earth. Here it mentions being caught away into Paradise, which is different from being "caught away to" the third heaven. Moreover, this man "heard unspeakable words" in Paradise, not in the third heaven. What Paul was saying was that this man had received special experiences in heaven and had heard unspeakable words under the earth. Although he had received such grace, he should still humble himself (v. 5b). How all those who have received special gifts should humble themselves!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMPELLING</H2><P>Question: If someone uses Matthew 5:39-42 to compel me until I can no longer bear it, how should I deal with it? (Pao, Nanking)</P><P>Answer: We should keep the Sermon on the Mount literally word for word. All that we can keep, we should keep. But this is nevertheless not a law. When the cross of the Lord does a deep work in man's heart, keeping these words will seem to be a natural thing. There will not be a time when we "can no longer bear it," because there is 1 Corinthians 10:13. If we believe this verse, the Lord must open the way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CAMEL GOING THROUGH A NEEDLE'S EYE</H2><P>Question: There is no such thing as a camel passing through a needle's eye. The same is true regarding a rich man entering into the kingdom of the heavens. If that is the case, what hope is there for a rich man? Please show me the deeper significance of this parable. (Pao, Nanking)</P><P>Answer: There is a difference between eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens. To receive eternal life is what we ordinarily speak of as being saved. Entering into the kingdom of the heavens is to rule with the Lord in the millennium. The Bible does not say that the rich cannot receive eternal life. All those who believe on the Lord Jesus as their Savior have eternal life, but it is not so easy to enter into the kingdom of the heavens and to rule with the Lord. One must forsake all and pick up his cross and follow the Lord. I am afraid there is not such a thing as a rich man entering into the kingdom of the heavens, because if a rich man enters into the kingdom of the heavens, he will not be a rich man any longer. (Some feel that the needle's eye here refers to a gate in Jerusalem, but this is man's thought.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</H2><P>Question: The Ten Commandments in Exodus 34 are different from the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. Exodus 34:28 says clearly that Jehovah wrote these commandments with His finger. Why is this? (Liu, Shantung)</P><P>Answer: There is no clear record of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 34. The Ten Commandments are only recorded in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. Exodus 34:10-26 are not the Ten Commandments, but God's speaking outside of the Ten Commandments. If we read carefully verses 27 and 28, we will know that there is a difference between "these words" in verse 27 and "the words of the covenant" in verse 28. "These words" in verse 27 refer to the words in verses 10-26; they are what God ordered Moses to write down. "The words of the covenant" in verse 28 refer to the Ten Commandments and were written by God Himself (Deut. 10:2-4). God made the covenant with the people of Israel (Exo. 34:27) according to the words of verses 10-26. The words of the covenant are the Ten Commandments (v. 28). From this we know that the words in verses 10-26 are not part of the words of the Ten Commandments; they are merely words according to which God made the covenant (Ten Commandments) with the people of Israel. We know that Moses went up to the mountain twice. The first time, God wrote the Ten Commandments on two stone tablets and gave them to him (Deut. 5:22). Later, because the people of Israel sinned, Moses broke the tablets. When he went up to the mountain the second time, the Bible says: Jehovah "wrote upon the tablets as He had done the first writing, the ten words" (Deut. 10:4). The Ten Commandments that Moses received twice on the mountain are completely the same without any difference. Deuteronomy 5 is a recount of Exodus 20, whereas Deuteronomy 10 is a recount of Exodus 34. Deuteronomy 10:4 clearly proves that the Ten Commandments received in Exodus 34:28 are the same as those in Exodus 20. Therefore, our conclusion is that the Ten Commandments received in Exodus 34 are the same as those received in Exodus 20, but they were not itemized. As to the words in 34:10-26, they are merely God's words besides the Ten Commandments that Moses recorded.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD OR SATAN</H2><P>Question: Second Samuel 24 and 1 Chronicles 21 record the same incident. Second Samuel says God moved David to number Israel, but 1 Chronicles says that Satan did it. The number of men that drew the sword is different in these two records also. How are these explained? (Liu, Shantung)</P><P>Answer: Dr. Gaebelein said that 2 Samuel 24:1 can be translated as "the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel and permitted David to be moved." Hence, 1 Chronicles states directly that Satan moved David, whereas 2 Samuel tells of God's stand concerning David's being moved, that He permitted David to be moved by Satan. Therefore, the two portions are not contradictory. Hence, the story should be as follows: The anger of God was kindled against Israel; Satan took the opportunity to move David to sin, while God allowed this to happen. As to why God was angry toward Israel, we find no clear record about this. On the second matter, the number of men who drew the sword, the records are as follows in the two books: Second Samuel says, "There were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men" (24:9). First Chronicles says, "All they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword" (21:5). What 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles speak of are two different things. Second Samuel tells the number of valiant men who drew the sword, whereas 1 Chronicles records the number of men who drew the sword. Dr. Scofield said, "Some discrepant statements concerning numbers are, however, found in the existing manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures. These are most naturally ascribed to the fact that the Hebrews used letters in the place of numerals. The letters from Koph to Tau express hundreds up to four hundred. Five certain Hebrew letters, written in a different form, carry hundreds up to nine hundred, while thousands are expressed by two dots over the proper unit letter: e.g., the letter Teth, used alone, stands for nine; with two dots it stands for nine thousand. Error in transcription of Hebrew numbers thus becomes easy, preservation of numerical accuracy difficult." (See footnote on 1 Corinthians 10:8 in the Scofield Reference Bible.) We should know that God is not responsible for mistakes in copying. For instance, on page 2057 of the Chinese Union Bible, the word gathered was misprinted as marry [translator's note: the Chinese characters for these two words are very similar]. In Numbers 3:35 the name of Merari was also misprinted. These are proofreading mistakes for which God is not responsible. Can we say that the Bible is in error because of these mistakes? May God bless you and lead you away from putting your trust in the unbelieving tune of the absurd higher critics.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ADAM AND EVE, AND SOLOMON</H2><P>Question: Are these three people saved or lost? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: We do not have to worry about whether dead persons are saved or lost, because God is just, and with Him there is no respect of persons (Rom. 2:11). However, these three are probably all saved. God made coats of skins (Gen. 3:21), which represent the salvation of the Lord Jesus, for Adam and Eve, so they are saved. Solomon is a type of Christ. Of course, he cannot possibly be lost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEAVEN</H2><P>Question: Concerning the leaven which is mentioned in Matthew 13, one group says it represents sin; another group says it represents power. Which is right? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: In the Bible leaven has never represented anything good (Matt. 16:11-12; Mark 8:15; 1 Cor. 5:6-8). Leaven represents sins and erroneous teachings. The three measures of meal being wholly leavened does not represent the power of the gospel changing the whole world, because in this very chapter the Lord Jesus said that the world will never change. Within the world there will be "tares" and "foul" things until the day of judgment. In the Bible there is no place for the social gospel and for believers who wish to improve the world. The world will get worse day by day until the Lord comes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PARABLES</H2><P>Question: By reading Matthew 13:10-15, one is led to believe that the purpose of using parables is to make the speaking difficult to understand. Ordinarily, people use parables to make the speaking easy to understand. Which is right? Which is wrong? (Tsui, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: In the first twelve chapters the Lord Jesus suffered the rejection of the Jews; so from chapter thirteen the Lord Jesus began to reject the people of Israel. In this chapter, the Lord distinguished His disciples from the Jews. His eyes were already looking at the church. Using parables here, the Lord was trying to make His disciples (the future church) understand the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens (v. 11) and at the same time cause the Jews to hear but not understand and to see but not comprehend. By using parables, He was not trying to make it difficult for all men to understand the truth, only part of the audience. Therefore, the question of which is right does not exist.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OUTER DARKNESS</H2><P>Question: Matthew 25:30 says to cast out the useless slave into the outer darkness. Is this darkness hell? Was that useless slave a believer? Do the believers go to hell because of not working? (Tsui, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: We know that all three kinds of slaves will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. The judgment seat of Christ will be in the air, where the believers will be caught up (1 Thes. 4:16-17b). Hence, these believers will be in the air, and the outer darkness will be outside of the air. For this reason, the outer darkness will not be in hell. By reading Psalm 18:9 and 11, we know that thick clouds and darkness will enclose His glory when Christ descends to the air. So, the unfaithful slave will not be cast into hell, but he will be thrown into the darkness outside of the mid-air. This slave is a believer. Believers who do not work cannot rule with the Lord and will be in the outer darkness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>Question: What is the proof that one is baptized in the Holy Spirit? One school uses speaking in tongues, as mentioned in Acts 10:46 and 19:6, as the proof of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Another school uses the fruit of the Spirit as the proof. Which of the two schools is right? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: The Bible does not say what the proof of the baptism of the Holy Spirit is. The proofs mentioned above are all man-made. In Acts there are many records of men being filled with the Holy Spirit, but speaking in tongues is only mentioned three times. This proves that not all those who were filled with the Holy Spirit spoke in tongues. Speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:4-10). "The same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes" (v. 11). Hence, not every believer receives the gift of tongues. The fruit of the Spirit proves whether or not we have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. To purposely seek after the speaking in tongues can lead to a counterfeit of an evil spirit. We must be careful about this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DISCIPLES AT EPHESUS</H2><P>Question: Were the twelve disciples in Acts 19 saved before they received the Holy Spirit? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: The Bible calls them disciples (Acts 19:1); disciples are Christians (11:26), those who believe in the Lord Jesus (Matt. 28:19). Ephesians 1:13 tells us that those who believe in the Lord Jesus are already sealed with the Holy Spirit. Therefore, these twelve disciples already had the Holy Spirit. What they had not received was the Spirit of resurrection and of Pentecost. The only Spirit they had not received was the outpoured Spirit (Acts 19:2). This does not mean that they had not received regeneration and the sealing of the Holy Spirit. These had already been saved (Eph. 1:13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</H2><P>Question: Romans 8:9 says that if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. Is this man saved? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: Of course he is not saved. But everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus as the Savior is of Christ and has the Spirit of Christ. Every saved person has the Spirit of Christ.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 9</H2><P>Whoever has questions concerning the Bible and the spiritual things can write to the editors; we will try our best to answer them. Please understand that unprofitable questions will not be answered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DIFFERENTIATING SHEEP</H2><P>Question: In Matthew 25:31-32 the Lord comes down to judge all the nations (referring to the Gentiles) to separate the sheep from the goats (referring to the saved ones and the unsaved ones). But at that time, how will the Gentiles be saved? Is it through faith (believing in the Lord Jesus as their Savior) or through works (done unto the least of the brothers)? If through works, then will the unbelievers who treat the believers well at this time be saved? Please explain in detail. (Yu, Kwangtung)</P><P>Answer: At the beginning of the great tribulation, the watchful saints will have already been raptured (Rev. 3:10). The saints who are not raptured and a small number of godly Jews will preach to the whole world the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens (somewhat different from the gospel of grace). Naturally, they will be persecuted. At that time, whoever treats these sent ones of God kindly will be saved. They will be saved because of their works; but we dare not say that they will not have any faith. By that time, the Lord Jesus will treat them according to the following principle: to receive the ones He sent, is to receive Himself. Today there is no other way to be saved except to believe in the Lord Jesus. Those who try to be saved by treating the believers well will still perish. Today is the age of grace; God only deals with man in grace. Because it is of grace, as long as you believe, you will be saved. But at the time of the great tribulation, it will be the age of law, and God will deal with man according to the law. Because it will be of the law, it will be a matter of works. Today it is utterly impossible for anyone to be saved through works (Gal. 3:11). Just as today men cannot be saved through the sacrifices (the Old Testament way of salvation), in the same way they cannot be saved through treating the believers well (the coming age's way of salvation).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SON NOT KNOWING</H2><P>Question: In Matthew 24:36 the Lord said, "But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens nor the Son...." Since the Son and the Father are one, why does the Father know something but the Son not know it? Perhaps the number of the saved ones is not fulfilled, and the Father's will is not yet accomplished, and therefore, the day and the hour depend on the Father's satisfaction. Please explain in detail. (Yu, Kwangtung)</P><P>Answer: In the four Gospels this word was recorded only in Mark 13:32. (Please read the footnote on Matthew 24:36 in Joseph Shih's (?) translation.) This fully matches the nature of the Gospel of Mark which portrays the Lord Jesus as a servant. The reason the Lord said these words was not that He knew the time but would not say it, nor that the time will be decided when the Father is satisfied. In reading the Bible, the hardest thing for us to do is to differentiate between the divine nature and the human nature of the Lord Jesus. Sometimes we can differentiate between the two; at other times we cannot do it. Sometimes it seems as if we can make a distinction, and at other times it seems as if we cannot do it. Here the Lord Jesus was referring to His humanity; it shows that He Himself was a fully humble servant, who knew nothing except to accept His Master's will. When we read the four Gospels, the most important thing is to remember that the Lord Jesus has both the divine and the human nature. Sometimes they only speak of His human nature, sometimes they only speak of His divine nature, and sometimes they speak of both His divine and human natures. Those who understand this will be saved from many misunderstandings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FALSE PROPHETS</H2><P>Question: The number of gospel preachers has increased in recent years. They all use the name Jesus as their entrance into preaching. But what do the "false prophets" mentioned in the Bible refer to? What is the way to identify them? (Ju, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: If we know what kind of persons the false prophets are, we will know how to identify them. Our Lord spoke of them (Matt. 24:24), Paul spoke of them (Acts 20:29-30; 1 Tim. 4; 2 Tim. 3), Peter spoke of them (2 Pet. 2:1), John spoke of them (1 John 2:4), and Jude also spoke of them. The characteristic of the false prophets is to tell lies! Please read Jeremiah 14:14; 23:25; 27:10, 14; Ezekiel 13:8. False prophets deviate from the Bible and reject it (Jer. 5:13; 23:16, 26, 30; 29:9; Ezek. 13:3, 6, 17). They promise people vain and fleeting prosperity and pleasure (Jer. 6:14; Ezek. 13:19; Jer. 14:13, 15-16; 23:17, 21; 27:9; 28:16). They are greedy (Jer. 6:3; Micah 3:11). The message that they preach is somewhat religious on the surface, but it actually helps people to do evil (Jer. 5:31; 23:14, 27, 32; Ezek. 13:22). Today the false prophets in the church are those who call themselves "modernists"; actually they are atheists. All their behavior is exactly the same as that of the false prophets spoken of in the Bible. They speak lies. They do not believe in the Bible. They tell people to reform themselves, and they give people empty hopes. They are greedy for glory from man. Their doctrines are only covered with a religious cloak but will cause people to perish. The Bible commands us to love our enemies, but regarding those who preach heresy, there are also some instructions (2 John 10; Jude 3). May we be faithful.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TONGUES</H2><P>Question: Those who have received the Holy Spirit now speak in tongues. But others do not understand their tongues. Are these tongues the same as the tongues spoken of in the Bible? (Ju, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: Some of the tongues mentioned in the Bible are not understood by others (1 Cor. 14:7-9), but they are still human languages (v. 21). Lately, the tongues spoken by those who claim they can speak in tongues are not dialects of any people in any country or in any place; they are merely a kind of yelling and shouting. These are not the tongues spoken of in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE "TRUE JESUS CHURCH"</H2><P>Question: I wonder how one should view the new, recently established True Jesus Church established by Barnabas Chang.</P><P>Answer: First, we should not criticize others, but for the sake of the truth we must reject heresy. Our present need is to speak the truth in love. The True Jesus Church is a heretical organization. They put aside the salvation of the cross and do not preach it. They emphasize only the Holy Spirit; but what they have actually received are evil spirits. Their exposition of the Bible is a hodgepodge of unrelated texts, an arbitrary, nonsensical speaking that is not even worthy for the knowledgeable ones to laugh at. We should contend against their various heresies (Jude 3), but our speaking should be seasoned with salt (Col. 4:6). On our part, we should pray for the ones deceived by the devil that they be set free. If there is a believer who believes that the spirit he has received is genuine, you should ask him to do according to 1 John 4:1 and 2. This assembly is totally Satan's deceiving work. What a shame that the deceived ones are not aware of this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PREDESTINATION</H2><P>Question: How do you explain "appointed" in 1 Peter 2:8? Some say that those who stumble at the word were all appointed by God, just as the believers also are appointed by God. Some others say, "Not so, God can only appoint people to be saved; God cannot appoint people not to be saved. Some stumble because God allows them to misuse their own right. So the word `appointed' here really means that God already has established the principle that whoever trusts in Him will not be put to shame, but whoever does not obey will surely be stumbled." Which of these two explanations is correct, and which one is wrong? Please instruct me in detail, or offer another explanation. (Song, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: God predestinated believers to be saved. The teaching of predestination is never applied to unbelievers. God never predestinated people to perish. It is wrong to say that "God can only appoint people to be saved," and it is also wrong to say that "God cannot appoint people not to be saved." God only predestinated people to be saved; He did not predestinate them not to be saved. The word "can" should be deleted from both sentences. The first one is wrong, because God wants all men to be saved (1 Tim. 2:4) and does not appoint anyone to perish. The problem of 1 Peter 2:8 is a mistake. In Acts 13:48 the original word for appointed is tasso. In Romans 8:29-30 and Ephesians 1:5 and 11, the original word for predestinated is proorizo. But here in 1 Peter 2:8, appointed is neither tasso nor proorizo but tithemi. The meaning of this word is not "ordained." The world-famous Greek scholar Mr. Young said the meaning of this word is "to set," "to place." So the meaning here is this: no one has been predestinated to be disobedient; hence, all disobedient ones are therefore appointed to (in the sense of being set or placed in) a place of stumbling. Whoever stumbles on this stone shall be broken; on whomever this stone shall fall, it will break him into pieces (Matt. 21:44).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SCRIPTURE RECORDS</H2><P>Question: Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10 record the story of a centurion asking for healing; why is one written in a subjective way and the other in an objective way? (Sang, Yangzhou)</P><P>Answer: What is recorded here is not two incidents. Neither is it one incident in two contradicting records. The fact is that: the centurion first sent someone to see the Lord, then later he himself came. The sequence is as follows. First is Luke 7:3-5, where he sent men to Jesus, then is Luke 7:6a, where the men came back. Next is Luke 7:6b-8 and Matthew 8:8-9, where he himself went also. This way of recording is completely in harmony with the nature of Matthew and Luke. Matthew deleted the record of the centurion sending the other Jews, but Luke did the opposite. Matthew deleted all that would make the Jews proud. Luke wrote to the Gentiles and related the goodness of the centurion through the mouth of the Jews. This is written for their benefit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CORPSE</H2><P>Question: What does corpse in Matthew 24:28 refer to? And what do vultures refer to? I am looking forward to receiving your instruction soon. (Chao, Reho)</P><P>Answer: The corpse refers to those who join Antichrist. The vultures refer to sins or judgment. Please read the answer to Mr. Lui in the seventh issue of this magazine.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNDER THE EARTH</H2><P>Question: What does the phrase under the earth in Philippians 2:10 mean? Is it the same as your explanation for 1 Peter 3:19 in the first issue of this magazine? (Wong, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: Hades (of which Paradise is a part) is under the earth. We have the following verses to prove it: Acts 2:31 compared to Matthew 12:40; Numbers 16:30-33. Tartarus (hell in 2 Pet. 2:4) means the deepest pit. Naturally, it is also under the earth. The bottomless pit is also under the earth (Rev. 9:1-2). So Philippians 2:10 means that the Lord Jesus is the Lord over everything in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, for there is a spirit world under the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CAPTIVITY</H2><P>Question: How to explain Ephesians 4:8-10? (Wong, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: In the preceding verse Paul was speaking of the gift of the Lord Jesus. Now he wants to show that the Lord is the Giver of the gift, and the gifts are for men. "When He ascended up on high, He led the one who captures men captive" (original text). Who was the Lord Jesus' captive? The one who captures men is Satan (Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15). When the believers died, they would have been imprisoned by the devil. This is the meaning of captivity. Therefore, the devil is called "the one who captures men." But when the Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended, He captured the men-capturing Satan, thus enabling the saints, though in Hades, to escape from the power of the devil. (This is why (1) the gates of Hades shall not prevail against the church, (2) the keys of Hades are in the Lord's hand, and (3) Hades becomes Paradise to the saints (Luke 23:43)). Matthew 27:52-53 is a proof of this. "And gave gifts to men." Before Christ resurrected and ascended, He did not give gifts to men. He first warred, then He won the victory. These gifts are the gifts of the Holy Spirit mentioned in Ephesians 4:11. He died, He won the victory, and He gave gifts to men. But from where did He "ascend"? He first "descended into the lower parts of the earth." He died, descended into Hades, and overcame Satan and the power of death; then He ascended. "He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens." The One who descended is also the One who ascended. What was the purpose for Him to do all these things? It is for the purpose that He would "fill all things." When He descended, He gained all under the earth; when He ascended, He gained the heavens. The meaning of the whole passage is that since the Lord Jesus died, resurrected, ascended, overcame the enemy, and filled all things, He is able to give gifts to men. These words are a quote of Psalm 68:18-19. He had to ascend on high to take the enemy captive before He could give gifts to men. (In Psalm 68:18, "the rebellious" refers to the Jews. Because this second part of the verse has nothing to do with the Gentiles, the apostle only quoted the first half of this verse). In Ephesians 4:9 and 10 the apostle proves that the Lord Jesus is that One who ascended and who took captives.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JECONIAH</H2><P>Question: Jehovah promised David that He would establish his kingdom forever, that his throne would be established forever, and so forth (2 Sam. 7). God simply wanted to fulfill this word in Christ (Acts 13:23; Matt. 2:5-6). Later, David gave the seal of the kingdom to his son, Solomon, who succeeded him on his throne as the bona fide king (1 Kings 1 --2). If this were the case, his throne should have continued until Christ, according to the Lord's promise. However, as we see in Jeremiah 22:30, because Jeconiah committed sins, Jehovah cut off his seed and did not allow him to be king to sit upon the throne of David! How then could his descendant, Jesus, sit upon the throne of David?</P><P>Answer: This matter shows that the Lord Jesus had to be born through the virgin Mary. It does not mean that Jeconiah did not have any sons. Jeremiah 22 merely says that his sons cannot be king. Matthew 1:12 even says that he begot Salathiel. Matthew 1:16 says, "...Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ." Christ was not born of Joseph. Joseph was the descendant of Jeconiah (Matt. 1:12-16), but the Lord Jesus was not the descendant of Joseph. Hence, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah and could therefore sit upon the throne of David. If, according to the modernists, the Lord Jesus had been born of Joseph, then they would not have the right to call Him Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ZEDEKIAH</H2><P>Question: According to 1 Chronicles 3:15-16, 2 Kings 24:17, and 2 Chronicles 36:10, is Zedekiah Jehoiakim's uncle or brother?</P><P>Answer: Zedekiah was Jehoiakim's uncle (2 Kings 24:17). Wordsworth said that in the original text of 2 Chronicles 36:10, the words his brother could be translated "his father's brother," that is, his uncle. Concerning 1 Chronicles 3:15-16, we should know the way in which the writer wrote the genealogy. Zedekiah was Josiah's third son (v. 15). But why was Zedekiah also the son of his nephew Jeconiah? (Verse 16 should be translated, "Jehoiakim's son is Jeconiah. Jeconiah's son is Zedekiah.") It is because the sons here are like the Chinese succession of rulers: a person appoints his uncle to succeed him as the ruler, so the uncle becomes his son. Here is a record of the genealogy of all the legal rulers. Zedekiah succeeded Jeconiah as king, so his name was recorded twice. If this is not the explanation, how can it be possible that the same person is recorded wrongly from one verse to the next! If we understand the style of the Bible, we will have fewer doubts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WINE</H2><P>Question: The Bible only asks people not to become drunken, but it does not ask people to abstain from drinking. Furthermore, Jesus changed water into wine, and He Himself also drank wine (Matt. 11:19). Should Christians try their best to abstain from drinking, or can they drink? Actually, in the church today some even drink wine openly. What should we do?</P><P>Answer: It is true that the Bible has not asked people to abstain from drinking. The New Testament commandment is to not be drunk with wine (Eph. 5:18). It is permissible to drink a little, but the concern is that a little may become a lot. As to what the Lord Jesus changed the water into, it was new wine. I myself do not drink wine, but neither do I abstain from wine, that is, from the cooking wine. If there is a drunkard in the church, he should be excommunicated (1 Cor. 5:9-13). Concerning this matter, we should follow 1 Corinthians 8:13.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DATE OF JESUS' CRUCIFIXION</H2><P>Question: I heard that a great American Bible expositor found out through his research that the Lord's death indeed occurred in A.D. 30, on Wednesday, April 5th, from 9 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the afternoon. Yet now the church always commemorates the Lord's death on Fridays. Furthermore, according to John 19:31 it should clearly be Friday. However, since John 20:1 says that on the first day of the week (that is Sunday), early in the morning while it was yet dark, they could not find Jesus in the tomb, I think He must have resurrected about midnight. If it was really on Friday, then the Lord Jesus died on that day in the late afternoon, and I think it must have been late at night when He was buried in the tomb. According to this calculation, how could the Lord have been in the tomb three days and three nights? Actually, it was only one day and one and a half nights. Which of these two dates is the correct one?</P><P>Answer: The idea that the Lord Jesus died on Friday is from the Roman Catholic Church. The saints who believe in the Bible have already denied this. But what a shame that the average person is still defenseless under the lasting effect of this poison. As far as the idea of a Wednesday death is concerned, Bible expositors from many countries also have this thought, but this would put the Lord Jesus in the heart of the earth for more than three days and three nights. The word of the Bible is the most reliable. Let us look at the Bible's own testimony. Matthew 12:40 says, "So will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights." And 16:21 says, He will "on the third day be raised." Putting these two verses together, we know that the three days and three nights the Lord Jesus spoke about are not absolute. Rather, they refer to the third day. Luke 24 says that on the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus met two disciples while they were on the way to Emmaus. As they talked about the death of the Lord Jesus, the disciples said, "Today is the third day since these things were done" (KJV). "Today" is the resurrection day. The Lord Jesus was resurrected the third day after He died. This is what Luke 24:21 says. The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the first day (Sunday) of the seven days. Three days ago was the fifth day of the seven days, which is our Thursday. The Lord Jesus died on Thursday. Hence, there is no contradiction between "the third day" and the word concerning three days and three nights. Part of Thursday, Friday, and Saturday constitute three days; and Thursday night, Friday night, and Saturday night constitute three nights. There also is no conflict between "After three days He will rise" (Mark 9:31) and "on the third day be raised." In 1 Kings 12:5 the king told the people to depart "for three days." Verse 12 says that according to the king's word they came back "the third day." Therefore, according to the biblical reckoning, "the third day" equals "after three days." The Bible does not command us to keep the so-called Good Friday or "Easter." These are just worldly pretenses to entertain the flesh, and they are altogether unprofitable for the spiritual life. The Bible only commands us to remember the Lord at His supper  (1 Cor. 11:24-25).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO SWORDS</H2><P>Question: In Luke 22:36 and 38 the Lord Jesus asked the disciples to sell their garments and buy swords. The disciples answered that there were two swords there. The Lord said that it was enough. But in Matthew 26:52 the Lord told the disciples not to use a sword. Is there any contradiction in these two portions of the Bible? How can one interpret Luke 22 which says that it was enough to have two swords. Please explain to me in detail. (Hsu, Kwangtung)</P><P>Answer: This question is one that Christians understand the least. We can examine and investigate it in detail. The passage where the Lord Jesus commanded the disciples to buy swords is recorded in Luke 22:35-38. This passage of the Bible has two problems that we must first resolve before we can begin to examine and investigate it. (1) Can we spiritualize the interpretation of these two swords? (2) If we cannot spiritualize it, then did the Lord Jesus ask the disciples to use the swords for fighting?</P><P>(1) We cannot interpret these two swords in a spiritual sense because, when the Lord Jesus commanded the disciples to prepare things, He did not command them to buy only swords. Verse 36 says, "Let him who has a purse take it, likewise also a bag; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one." The Lord here commanded them to prepare three things. If the sword signifies something, then the purse must also signify something, and so must the bag. If the purse is the purse and the bag is the bag, then the sword must also be the sword. We cannot say that the two swords refer to the New and the Old Testaments, or to the two robbers, or to any other things. A sword is a sword; we cannot interpret it in a spiritual sense. How unfair it is if every time we come across a difficult verse that we do not understand, we try to interpret it in a spiritual sense! (2) If the sword is a sword, then was it the intention of the Lord Jesus to ask them to buy swords and use them for fighting? No. There are three reasons: (a) There were eleven disciples besides Judas. If the Lord Jesus were to ask them to solve the problem by force, how could two swords be enough for eleven people? When the disciples said that there were two swords, the Lord Jesus stopped and did not say anything more. He did not ask them to buy nine more, which shows that it was not His original intention to buy swords and use force. (b) If the Lord Jesus' original intention was to use force, then Peter had already done so; he had tried to solve the problem by force already. Nevertheless, the Lord Jesus opposed him, saying, "Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword" (Matt. 26:52). (c) If the Lord Jesus had wanted them to use force, then this would have been entirely contrary to the teaching that says "not to resist him who is evil" (5:38-44).</P><P>We have concluded that (1) the sword is a sword and that (2) buying the swords was not for the purpose of using force. What then was the Lord Jesus' intention in saying what He said? How do we get the true interpretation? To get the true interpretation, we must first know a few things: (1) Although the sword the Lord Jesus spoke of was a real sword, His intention was not regarding the sword. If He really wanted the disciples to buy swords, but they had only two swords, should they not buy more so that there would be enough? (2) The Lord Jesus' heart was not set on the sword only. What He spoke of was the purse, the bag, and the sword. The sword is just one of the three. (3) At that time in Judea there were many robbers on the public roads (Luke 10:30), so that almost every Jew carried a sword. Swords at that time were just like today's walking sticks. (4) This whole passage (Luke 22:35-38) is concerning the events of that night. Verse 37 seemingly has no connection with the rest of the passage. If we do not understand verse 37, then we surely cannot interpret this portion of the Scripture. To interpret the Bible we should take care of the context of the verses. We cannot carelessly delete a verse that we do not understand, and then go on to interpret the rest. (5) We should know the background behind the Lord Jesus' word in verse 36. Why would the Lord Jesus say this? When did the Lord Jesus say this? We must know these things. (6) We must remember that we cannot interpret this portion of the Word in a spiritual sense, and that the sword is not for fighting.</P><P>Now we can follow these points to slowly examine and investigate these verses. Verse 35 says, "And He said to them, When I sent you without purse and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you? And they said, Nothing." Here the Lord Jesus reminded them of the way He first sent them out. When they went out at that time, they had no purse, no bag, and no shoes. But neither had they any lack. Why did they not lack anything? This record of sending is recorded in Luke 9 and Matthew 10. Matthew's record is in more detail, so let us read it here. At that time the Lord Jesus sent them out to preach the gospel of the kingdom to the house of Israel. At that time, the Lord Jesus demonstrated His authority as the Messiah. When the disciples went to preach, they preached for the purpose that men would receive Him as the Messiah. The worker is worthy of his food (Matt. 10:10). Hence, they did not have to prepare their own sustenance (v. 9) and would have no lack (Luke 22:35). This was the result of the authority of the Lord Jesus as Messiah. What about now? The Lord Jesus had already manifested Himself to the children of Israel. But they would not receive Him. Rather, they rejected Him again and again. What should He do now? "He was counted with the lawless" (v. 37). He was to be crucified. Not only did men not want Him to be the Messiah, they swore to kill Him. (This is the meaning of verse 37.) Now He was about to fulfill the Scriptures to suffer and to lose the authority of the glorious Messiah. As such, He could no longer exercise His Messianic authority to make preparations for His sent ones. Although earlier they were without lack even when they did not make preparations for the purse, the bag, or the shoes, by that time, it could not be so any longer. "But now, let him who has a purse take it, likewise also a bag; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one" (v. 36). "Because I will be crucified and rejected by men as the Messiah, the supply and protection that you received before on account of My being your Messiah will now be stopped (temporarily). You have to prepare for yourselves." This is what the Lord Jesus meant in these three verses.</P><P>The first part of verse 36, "But now," is most important. It shows us that by then the time had changed. "But now" refers to that period of time from the beginning of the supper to the time of crucifixion. During this period of time the Lord Jesus was in fact rejected by the world. The real intention of the Lord Jesus in speaking to His disciples was not that they would pay attention to their purses, bags, or swords, but that they would understand the position He was in at that time and that they would know that He was soon to be crucified. But the disciples did not understand what He meant. Instead, they thought the Lord Jesus was actually referring to the purse, the bag, and the sword. Their thoughts were totally dominated by material things. Even up to this time, they still had no spiritual knowledge. (Please read John 21:22-23.) Also, deep within them, they were inclined to use force and to exercise the weapons of the flesh. This is why they answered the Lord, saying, "Lord, behold, here are two swords" (Luke 22:38). They thought that the Lord really wanted the swords! The Lord answered, "It is enough." What does this word, It is enough really refer to? First, it definitely does not refer to the swords. How can the two swords be enough for eleven people? The meaning of the Lord's word was not that the two swords were enough. Otherwise, when Peter used one of the swords, why did the Lord rebuke him? Therefore, the "enough" must refer to something else. The Lord Jesus knew that His disciples were still not able to receive His word; their thoughts were still in the old creation. What He was saying was, "It is enough --there is no need to say anything more. You cannot understand My word." "It is enough" here has the same meaning as the Chinese expression, "That is all," but with more gentleness and less coldness and harshness. What a pity that just as the disciples did not understand on that day, in the same way people do not understand today. The disciples did not understand the Lord's word. That is why later they asked, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?" (v. 49). Today, those who do not understand the Lord's word (Matt. 5) still foolishly ask the same question. To the disciples' astonishment the Lord answered, "For all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword." There should be no "Christ-soldiers" on this earth!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(6)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><P>If anyone desires to ask biblical or spiritual questions, he may send letters to the editor.

Is there any difference between them? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: The Paradise in Revelation 2:7 is "the Paradise of God" which is the New Jerusalem in the future. We can see this by considering the tree of life which is in the midst of it. The Paradise in Luke 23 and 2 Corinthians 12 refers to the Paradise underneath the earth where the dead believers go.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRANCE</H2><P>Question: What is meant by trance in Acts 10:10 and 22:17? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: A trance is when the Holy Spirit causes the saints to leave their bodies temporarily and enter into the spiritual realm to receive supernatural vision. John's revelation is such a one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF SAMUEL</H2><P>Question: In the whole chapter of 1 Samuel 28, witchcraft was used by the medium to bring up Samuel. Was it his soul or body that came up? Why did he come up from underneath the earth? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: It was his spirit, because his body had been buried and had already decayed. The spirit also has its form. Therefore, the rich man in Hades still had eyes, a tongue, and so forth. Both Hades and Paradise are underneath the earth. This is why Samuel came up from underneath the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION FOR THOSE<br>WHO NEVER HEARD THE GOSPEL</H2><P>Question: Before the gospel of the Lord came to China, there were many God-fearing, righteous people who had not heard the gospel and had no knowledge to believe in the Lord. May I ask, how did these people get saved? (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: One thing is certain, "There is no respect of persons with God" (Rom. 2:11). Romans 2:7-8, 12-15 refers to this question.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BAPTIZER</H2><P>Question: Baptism by immersion is the most scriptural method. It is the Lord's command. But my previous baptism was not by immersion. I am aware of the fact that this is incomplete, and I really hope to be baptized by immersion in the near future. I do not know who should be the baptizer or whether there are any qualifications for such a one. Please answer in detail. (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: It is correct to say that baptism by immersion is most scriptural. There is no reason that any faithful child of God should be excused. Baptism by a pastor is part of the system of the denominations today. However, is this the teaching of the Bible? Where is there such an ordinance in the Bible? This is but a poison of the Roman Catholic Church that has not been completely removed from the denominations! In the Bible baptism is committed to the "disciples" (Matt. 28:16, 19). The disciples were the Christians (Acts 11:26). Hence, every disciple, or Christian, can baptize others. All who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior can baptize others. Aside from this, all are human traditions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RELEASING SATAN</H2><P>Question: In Revelation 20:7-8, since Satan has been locked up by then, and can be thrown into the lake of fire any time, why is he loosed to deceive many? (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: It is very difficult for men to explain what God has ordained. However, in the millennium many people will still be born. They cannot be identified as being good or evil unless they are tested by Satan. Furthermore, it seems that without this step, the millennium cannot come to a proper end, and the new heaven and new earth cannot be ushered in.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RISING UP OF THE SAINTS</H2><P>Question: Do believers who have slept in the Lord ascend to heaven directly, or do they wait in Hades for the Lord's coming? (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: They have not yet ascended to heaven. The same is true with the saints in the Old Testament (John 3:13). They wait in Hades-the Paradise section-until the Lord's coming. Therefore, the future resurrection of the saints is rendered in the original text of the Bible as a "rising up." To be "up" is to come from below. Hence, they are now in Hades.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN PREACHING</H2><P>Question: I read the Question and Answer Box in the fifth issue which said that for women to preach is improper. This is right. But did Paul forbid it because at that time the women who preached in the meetings were not spiritual and were disorderly, or because it is wrong for women to preach, then and now, and whether or not they are spiritual? Why does the Lord Jesus pour out His Spirit upon many women in this age and choose them to preach to all nations? If women must not preach at all, may I ask then what is the explanation for Acts 2:17-18 and 21:9? (Chung, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: In the fifth issue of The Christian, we did not say that "for women to preach is improper." Our teaching is that women should not preach in the meetings, that is, in a church meeting where there is a mixture of men and women. Women can preach (1 Cor. 11:5), but the Bible forbids them to speak "in the churches" (14:34). We should make this distinction. It was not due to the fact that the women in those days were not spiritual that Paul restrained them. Paul said, "For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church" (v. 35). Moreover, immediately after this, Paul said, "If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him fully know the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord" (v. 37). Today, man considers that spiritual women can preach in the meetings, but Paul considered that if women were spiritual, then they would not preach in the meetings! The world considers that spiritual women can be an exception, but the Bible uses this to test who is spiritual: those who are spiritual will not open their mouth! It is true that the Lord Jesus chose many women to preach for Him, but the Lord did not command them to preach in the meetings. Pentecost was a fulfillment of the prophecy in Acts 2:17-18, but we do not see Mary or other women standing up to preach in the meetings among male and female. Peter was the only one who preached there. It is true that they prophesied in Acts 21:9, but the Bible does not say that they did it in the meetings. Women can preach, but they should not preach in meetings that have both men and women. This is the Lord's commandment, and all who are spiritual should obey it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH<br>AND SOCIAL REFORM</H2><P>Question: Is the Chinese Independent Church the same as the Christian Social Reform? Please inform me. I ask this because there are many who want to form an Independent Church. (Chang, Honan)</P><P>Answer: The Independent Church is one of the present denominations. Social Reform is one of the institutions established by the denominations. The two are different. In the Bible, there is never such a thing as the Independent Church. Everything concerning the church should be practiced wholly in accordance with the Bible. A church that is really in accordance with the Bible cannot be established just because man "wants to" establish it. God's attitude toward the existing denominations is to "flee" (2 Tim. 2:21-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE YOUTH IN LINEN CLOTH</H2><P>Question: Is the young man in Mark 14:51-52 Joseph? And why did he have a linen cloth cast about his naked body while following Jesus? When all laid hold on him, he left the linen cloth and fled. What is the hidden meaning? Please inform me. (Chang, Honan)</P><P>Answer: I do not know whether he was Joseph or not. Verses 51 and 52 are a continuation of verse 50. It is just to show how the disciple fled for his life on that day and did not even care for the linen cloth!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SUBJECT ON THE MOUNT OF TRANSFIGURATION</H2><P>Question: First Peter 3:19-20: "In which also He went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, who had formerly disobeyed when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah." Again 4:6 says, "For unto this end the gospel was announced also to those who are now dead, that they might be judged in the flesh according to men but live in the spirit according to God." Some have said that this was the subject Jesus discussed with Moses and Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration? (Chuan, Hsuyiu)</P><P>Answer: The Lord Jesus did not discuss this subject with Moses and Elijah on the Mount of Transfiguration. Luke 9:31 says, "Who [Moses and Elijah] appeared in glory and spoke of His departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem." The thing which the Lord Jesus was about to complete through His death was redemption. The subject on the Mount of Transfiguration was the redemptive death of the Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DAN BEING REMOVED</H2><P>Question: Revelation 7 recorded that a hundred and forty-four thousand were sealed. But the tribe of Dan was not included in this number. Instead, Joseph and his son Manasseh take up two tribes. What is the hidden meaning in this? Please instruct me. (Chen, Kutien)</P><P>Answer: The number one hundred and forty-four thousand does not mean that that is the only number of saved ones among Israel. These one hundred and forty-four thousand people are those related to the Lord's administration during His reign in the millennium. Dan is not mentioned here. However, Ezekiel 48:1 says clearly that in the millennial kingdom Dan's position will be in the north of Palestine. From this, we can see that the one hundred and forty-four thousand is not the number of saved Israelites entering the millennial kingdom. It has to mean something else. As far as the reason for Dan's removal, the record of the Bible from Genesis 49 on reveals Dan's apostasy and degradation. Dan's name was removed once in the Books of Chronicles already. God removed Dan because it was a tribe of idol worshippers. It has no part in Christ's administration. In the millennial kingdom, Dan's position will be merely to judge its own people, as one of the tribes of Israel (Gen. 49:16). The reason Joseph and his sons occupy two tribes can be seen in 1 Chronicles 5:1-2 and Genesis 49:26.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</H2><P>Question: When Matthew speaks of the kingdom of the heavens, is it referring to the kingdom of God or to the church? According to chapter thirteen, where the kingdom of the heavens is likened unto leaven, I feel that the kingdom of the heavens is referring to the corruption of the church. How is it? Please instruct me. (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: The kingdom of God is the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 13:31-33, cf. Luke 13:18-21, etc.). However, the kingdom of the heavens is not the kingdom of God. (Matthew mainly speaks of the kingdom of the heavens, yet sometimes it speaks of the kingdom of God, as in 12:28, etc.) The sphere of the kingdom of God is very broad and includes the kingdom of the heavens. Therefore, sometimes the kingdom of God is the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom of the heavens refers only to the saints' exercise at present and their reigning in the future. If we want to know if within a certain passage there is a difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens, we have to consider the context. Neither does the kingdom of the heavens refer to the church. The church is a house (1 Tim. 3:15). The kingdom of the heavens is a kingdom. At present the saints are in both of these things. The church speaks of our position, and the kingdom of the heavens speaks of our walk. The church is a grace we have received, whereas the kingdom of the heavens is an exercise we are subject to. To enter into the kingdom of the heavens, we need to have the practical righteousness (Matt. 5:20) and to become as undefiled as little children (18:3). Therefore, the tares, the birds, the leaven, and the foul things from the sea in Matthew 13 are not the things in the kingdom of the heavens; they are those having a name only without the reality. They have not really entered into the kingdom of the heavens.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DEVIL</H2><P>Question: The devil was a God-created angel. Because he became proud and desired to be as great as God, God drove him out of heaven into the world and cut him off from God forever. From then on, he became the devil (also called Satan), the enemy of man and of God. What I want to ask is: from what book is this matter revealed? Probably it was not man's fabrication. Please instruct me. (Honan)</P><P>Answer: The origin of the devil, as you described it, can be found in Ezekiel 28 and Isaiah 14:12-14. Ezekiel 28 speaks of the king of Tyre, and Isaiah 14 speaks of the king of Babylon. According to the view of the world's best Bible expositors, these two places in the Bible do not refer only to men, because many of the things said cannot be applied to men of flesh. Satan is behind the kings of Tyre and Babylon. For a detailed explanation, please read The Christian, Issue No. 3.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD HAVING CREATED THE DEVIL?</H2><P>Question: Since the devil was created by God, when he committed sin, would it not have been simpler for God just to destroy him? Why should he be driven to the earth to seduce men to sin, and why did God then have to prepare a way of salvation for man? Is this not too troublesome? (Honan)</P><P>Answer: God did not create the devil. What God created was a beautiful angel. The devil was created by Satan himself. It is similar to the fact that God only created Adam, but He did not create a sinner. God's way of salvation cannot be apprehended by men. Although men have many ideas, these ideas only expose men's foolishness. Concerning these things, many times we have only one prepared answer: "I don't know." We should have the attitude of Deuteronomy 29:29.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEMPTATION OF JOB</H2><P>Question: When the devil sinned, he was driven to the earth away from God's presence and became the enemy of man and God. Why is it that the devil was able to go before God again to accuse Job? Why would God even grant the devil's request to test Job? If Job's faith was not strong at that time and he had failed, who would be responsible for this? (Honan)</P><P>Answer: God has His timing, and before the time He has set for the devil is up, the devil can still come before God. By Revelation 12, he will not be able to do it any longer. God permitted the devil to do things to His children in order to manifest the faith of His children for His glory. If Job had failed, the one responsible would have been Job himself. The outward temptation only shows the inward reality. Of course, the devil also is partly responsible. Nevertheless, 1 Corinthians 10:13 cannot be wrong.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN PREACHING</H2><P>Question: In the Old Testament age, men were for the most part ignorant of God's will. There was often the custom of esteeming the male and despising the female. In the New Testament, the Lord Jesus broke down the boundary between male and female. Both are created by God, both are God's children, and therefore, there is no important difference between them. In 1 Corinthians 11:5 the apostle Paul says, "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head." Also 1 Timothy 2:12 says, "But I do not permit a woman to teach." May I ask, is it sinful for a woman to pray with no head covering? Is it sinful for a woman to preach? Why is it that in these days women pray without a head overing? How come there are still so many women who preach! (Honan)</P><P>Answer: Because men rebelled against the teachings of the Bible, they drifted with the current of the world. Adam was created first and then Eve (1 Tim. 2:13). Man is the head of the woman (1 Cor. 11:3), and the woman was created to help the man (v. 9; Gen. 2:18). These are unchanging principles of the Bible. The present women's liberation movement tries to overthrow God's ordained order. How sad it is! Originally, women did have their own position; to oppress them or to take advantage of them is not permitted by the Bible. However, for anyone to change the positions which God has ordained for male and female is abominable to God. It is not because I am a male that I speak this way. If I were a female, I would also insist on the same. The Bible is the only standard for our words and actions. We do not want to hear what worldly philosophy says. We dare not say whether it is sinful for a woman to pray with no head covering and to preach in the meetings. But one thing we know: to do this is against the commandment of the Scripture. Some may ask, "If the Bible says this, will it not be standing in the way of the tide of the age?" Our answer is this: "When have we ever seen the Bible going along with the tide of the age?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PREACHING IN HADES</H2><P>Question: First Peter 3:19-22 says that the Lord Jesus went down to Hades and preached to the spirits in prison-those who were drowned by the Deluge in the days of Noah. Is there such a thing that the Lord Jesus went down to Hades to preach? First Peter 4:6 also recorded, "The gospel was announced also to those who are now dead." If the dead are still able to hear the gospel, then the living ones do not have to believe any longer. Is this kind of teaching possible? Otherwise, how are these verses to be explained? (Honan)</P><P>Answer: This question has been answered in Issue No. 1. Please read it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEMPTATION OF JESUS</H2><P>Question: Did the Holy Spirit purposely lead the Lord Jesus to the wilderness to be tempted by the devil? When the devil tempted Jesus in the wilderness on that day, was it a visible kind of temptation, or was it an invisible kind of temptation?</P><P>A visible kind of temptation would be one in which the devil tempted Jesus through man. If the devil tempted Jesus through man, please read Luke 4:5 [KJV], which says that he led Him up to a high mountain! How can there be such a high mountain in the wilderness? What was the name of this mountain? Verse 9 says, "And he led Him into Jerusalem and set Him on the wing of the temple." Was there a Jerusalem in the wilderness? Was there a temple? If there were none, how did the devil take Jesus to these places?</P><P>An invisible kind of temptation would be for the Lord Jesus to go into the wilderness after He was baptized in the river Jordan and be caught up in a trance while contemplating and meditating there, and for the devil to take advantage of this, leading Him to a high mountain and to Jerusalem, showing Him everything, and inducing Him to submit to him, thus annulling the work of salvation. Which one of these two understandings is right? Please instruct me. (Honan)</P><P>Answer: The first Adam failed because of temptation. Unless the last Adam goes through temptations also, He cannot prove His qualifications. At the river Jordan God has already acknowledged Him to be His Son. Now this has to be declared before Satan. The Holy Spirit purposely led the Lord Jesus to the wilderness to be tempted. The devil tempts us by entering into our mind. However, from John 14:30 we see that he could not enter into the Lord Jesus to tempt Him. Therefore, he probably came with a form. But even with a form, the devil is free to come and go in a supernatural way (Job 1). Hence, there is not a problem as you have imagined.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE UNJUST STEWARD</H2><P>Question: In Luke 16:1-9, it seems that the Lord's intention in speaking the parable is to disapprove of this kind of person. But in verse 8 He commended the same for doing wisely, as if He somewhat approved of him. Verse 9 says, "And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles." This seems to indicate that the disciples should make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness that they may gain something later on. May I ask what is the meaning of these two verses? (Honan)</P><P>Answer: "The master" in verse 8 was the master in this story, not the Lord in heaven. The Lord in heaven did not commend this way. The Lord's teaching is that man should use his mammon to save souls (rather than to contribute to the denominations), that others may be saved through one's offerings. When we die, we will have friends who, due to our offerings, have been saved, and they will receive us into the eternal tabernacles. Any kind of money stands in opposition to God (v. 13) and is therefore unrighteous. Money itself is the "mammon of unrighteousness."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN HOLDING OFFICES</H2><P>Question: Historically, women have only held the office of deaconess in the church. This can be seen clearly from the Bible. Recently, I read the special issue of the Seminary Magazine on history, and I found out that the Quakers in Nanking are actually having women pastors. I also read the Women Pastors' Magazine, which said that the Hunan Presbyterian Church also has appointed women as elders. Can a woman hold the positions of pastors and elders in the church? I hope you will give me some clear advice! (Tsui, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: All things that the Bible has not covered are human inventions and traditions. Modern men think that advances in the world today and the tide of the age have precipitated the need for the church to have better organization than that recorded in the Bible. I may be a fool, and I dare say that there are many more fools like me who would not dare to speak or think this way. I tremble when I hear these kinds of words. For women to be pastors and elders is but one expression of the rebellion and insubordination of the world today. What a pity this is! The Word of God says, "Let a woman learn in quietness and in all subjection; but I do not permit a woman to teach or to assert authority over a man, but to be in quietness" (1 Tim. 2:11-12). Today the spirit of antichrist is active everywhere, and all past regulations and boundaries are systematically being destroyed. The so-called equality and freedom are but terms only! The females are like this, and the males are no exception either. The Bible considers pastoring a kind of gift given to the entire church (Eph. 4:11-12). Modern men, however, consider it as a kind of office and a system in the church. This is far from the revelation of the holy Scripture. As far as the elders are concerned, only the apostles and those who are charged by the apostles have the authority to establish them. But at present, there are no apostles, yet there are the elders! There is too much of the human element in the church! We should confess our failures before the Lord more, and we should ask Him to revive His children more. Amen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WATER AND BLOOD</H2><P>Question: Yesterday a friend of mine asked about 1 John 5:6, "This is He who came through water and blood," and wanted to know how one should interpret the water? I could not answer this. (Tsui, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: In expounding the Bible, we must be balanced. The blood in this verse is just blood; therefore, the water in this verse must also be just water. Since the blood cannot be interpreted spiritually, the water should not be interpreted spiritually either. Water is for cleansing, and the blood is for redemption. The Lord Jesus came not only to cleanse, but also to redeem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT ONE HAIR PERISHING</H2><P>Question: Luke 21:16 says, "They will put some of you to death," but verse 18 says, "Yet a hair of your head shall by no means perish." Why does it say that they will be put to death, and at the same time that not one of their hairs shall perish? Is there an error in translation? Please instruct me. (Tsui, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: Although the Lord Jesus died, the word of the Scripture was fulfilled in that not one bone of His was broken. The same is true here. Furthermore, though these ones will be killed in their bodies, not one of their hairs will be hurt. There is no error in the translation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HEAVEN AND THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</H2><P>Question: What is the difference between heaven and the kingdom of the heavens? (Chen, Changchou)</P><P>Answer: Heaven is the ultimate dwelling place of the saved ones and is the New Jerusalem. The kingdom of the heavens is where the saints are being disciplined today and where in the future they will be reigning with the Lord for a thousand years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REFORMATION</H2><P>Question: Was the church's dark age and Martin Luther's Reformation prophesied by the prophets of old, or was it spoken of by the Lord Jesus? (Chen, Changchou)</P><P>Answer: The prophets of old did not speak about it. In Revelation 3:1-6 the Lord Jesus did speak about it. Historically, Sardis is the age of Protestantism.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BLASPHEMING THE HOLY SPIRIT</H2><P>Question: What is the explanation of Matthew 12:31-32? What was the reason behind those words? Please instruct me. (Chung Nai-Cheng)</P><P>Answer: To sin by blaspheming the Holy Spirit was for men to harden their hearts when they knew (v. 27) that the Lord Jesus Himself had cast out demons by the Holy Spirit (v. 28), and for them to say that He cast out the demons by the ruler of the demons (v. 24). This sin occurred only in those days. The Lord Jesus came to the world to save men; all sins against Him and all other sins can be forgiven. But those who blasphemed the Holy Spirit, who purposely disbelieved when clear proofs were there, and who spoke blasphemous words had their hearts hardened to a point beyond repentance. As such, their sin remained and could not be forgiven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BIRTH DATE OF THE SAVIOR</H2><P>Question: Some consider it inaccurate to say that the Savior was born on December 25th. What then is the actual date? Some oppose meetings on Christmas Day. Should Christians remember Him on this day or not? (Chung, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: The Bible does not tell us on which day the Savior was born. This shows that God does not want man to know the date. December 25th came from the Roman Catholic Church. History tells us that this date was fixed by man, and it is therefore not accurate. God only commands us to remember the Lord at His supper (1 Cor. 11:23-26). We should not add anything to what God has not spoken. Hence, Christians should not go along with men to celebrate.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PORTRAIT OF THIS AGE</H2><P>Question: Matthew 11:16-17 say, "But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others and say, We have played the flute to you, and you did not dance; we have sung a dirge, and you did not mourn." I have considered it over and over again, and I am not able to understand it. Therefore, I am sending you this letter especially to inquire about this. (Wang Hua-Wu)</P><P>Answer: The explanation of these two verses is in the following two verses, 18 and 19. The Lord Jesus came and preached the gospel; He is the Bridegroom who gives man the new wine, and His mission is recorded in Luke 4:18-19. His preaching of the glad tidings was like a kind of piping to them, yet that generation did not respond in joy. John the Baptist came and preached repentance, and he told people that every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire. How sobering this is! Yet, that generation heard him mourn in such a way, but did not lament with repentance. Men of this age are the same! They have heard about hell, but are still not fearful; they have heard about heaven, but are still not joyful. Their end will indeed be pitiful!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW AND THE OLD</H2><P>Question: What does Matthew 13:52 mean by the things new and old? Can it mean the mixture of the new and the old religion? What will happen if I cannot follow Jesus' teaching in John 15:13? Please answer. (Lee, Linshui)</P><P>Answer: Matthew 13:52 is speaking about the importance of understanding the parables of the kingdom of the heavens. The new and old things do not have any specific reference. What the Lord Jesus meant was that if the scribes understood the words concerning the kingdom of the heavens, they would be able to teach others easily, like being able to bring forth things new and old out of their treasury at will.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A BLOODY HUSBAND</H2><P>Question: In Exodus 4:24-26, why did God want to kill Moses? How do you explain "a bloody husband"? (Lee, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: Moses was about to represent the law, but his son was not yet circumcised. In order to be under the law, he had to do this. Verse 26 tells us the meaning of a bloody husband. He was stained with blood through circumcision. This is why he was called a bloody husband.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESURRECTION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS</H2><P>Question: Since you went back, I have been reading two chapters of the Bible a day. Matthew 27:52 says, "And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised." This is the resurrection of the dead saints. But there is a record in another place of the Bible which says that Christ is the firstborn from the dead. How could some get resurrected before the Lord Jesus died? Please explain. (Chien, Changchou)</P><P>Answer: The Bible only considers Christ as the firstfruit of resurrection (1 Cor. 15:20), but He was not the first person who resurrected. In the Old Testament, Elisha raised the dead. When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He raised at least three persons from the dead. The resurrection of these saints should not be considered as something strange. The meaning of Christ being the firstfruit is that He is the only One who had His kind of resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HUSBAND IN ROMANS 7</H2><P>Question: What does "the husband" in Romans 7:2-3 refer to? I have heard some say that it refers to the "old self"-the flesh, whereas others say that it refers to the "law." (Lee, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: It refers to the passions for sins in the flesh. We are the "woman," and the "passions for sins" (v. 5) is the "husband." When the husband is living, the woman is bound by the law (v. 2). When the passions for sins are living, we are bound by the law (vv. 5-6). The passions for sins become dead through the body of Christ. In this way, the law also becomes dead (v. 4), and we are free.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SEVENTY-FIVE OR SEVENTY</H2><P>Question: How do you explain the "seventy-five souls" in Acts 7:14 and the seventy souls in Genesis 46:27? (Lee, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: The seventy souls is the number of the house of Jacob (Gen. 46:27), which are "his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed" (v. 7). The "seventy-five souls" includes all of Jacob's relatives. Acts 7:14 is the number for "all his family," which in the original language means "relatives." Thus, there were five more relatives. It was reasonable to include them. Therefore, the two passages do not contradict one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ABRAHAM AND JACOB</H2><P>Question: Genesis 33:18-19 and Joshua 24:32 both speak about Jacob buying a parcel of a field from Hamor. Why in Acts 7:16 does it say that Abraham did it? Please explain. (Lee, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: Acts 7:16 is in harmony with Genesis 50:13. According to Genesis 49:29-32 and 50:13, Jacob was buried in the parcel of land that Abraham bought. Acts 7:16 was right on this point. However, in between Abraham's purchasing of the land (Gen. 23) and Jacob's purchasing of the land, there were about eighty years. During those eighty years, the landlord came again to take over the land; Jacob did not fight with him, but repurchased the same land that his grandfather had bought. The land which Jacob purchased was the same lot Abraham bought; Shechem's father and Ephron were both Hamor's descendants. These two points are explained clearly in Acts 7:16. Therefore, there is no contradiction here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS</H2><P>Question: How do you explain the "four hundred years" in Genesis 15:13 and Acts 7:6, and the "four hundred thirty years" in Exodus 12:40? (Lee, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: The Israelites "dwelt" in Egypt for four hundred thirty years (Exo. 12:40). However, during the first thirty years, they lived in peace. During those four hundred thirty years, they were only afflicted four hundred years. These two portions are in perfect harmony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPHECY OF JACOB</H2><P>Question: How do you explain Genesis 49:3-27? (Lee, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: Genesis 49 is Jacob's blessing for the twelve tribes of Israel. Moses' blessing in Deuteronomy 33 stresses God's purpose more, whereas the emphasis here is on their experience. This chapter is divided into four sections, with every three tribes comprising a section. In Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, we see man's natural condition. In Zebulun, Issachar, and Dan we see that, although God has the blessings, there are still forces that pull one away from Him. In Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, we see the result of salvation. In Judah, Joseph, and Benjamin, we see Christ. Verses 5 through 7 speak of Simeon and Levi's cruelty; chapter thirty-four is one example of it. Verse 7 was eventually fully fulfilled. Nothing more needs to be said of Levi. For Simeon, see Joshua 19:1-9. Verses 8 through 12 speak of Judah's kingship. David came from this tribe. Shiloh is Christ. Verses 11 and 12 show the state of the millennial kingdom, where Christ will reign. Verse 13 speaks of Zebulun's commerce. Verses 14 to 15 speak of Issachar's love for a quiet life and hard labor. Verse 16 is Dan's latter state. Verse 17 is related to his apostasy. Verse 18 is Jacob's prayer. Verse 19 is Gad's initial defeat and final victory. Verse 20 tells of Asher's production. Verse 21 speaks of Naphtali's goodly words. Verses 22 to 26 mention the blessings received by Joseph, who typifies Christ. Verse 27 is Benjamin's future. His condition, as such, partly typifies the power of Christ. We cannot relate them all in detail. If the Lord tarries, please read Meditations on Genesis. However, you can look up the history of the tribes sequentially in the holy Scriptures, and you can find the fulfillment to all these prophecies.</P><P>P.S. Concerning the Companion Bible you mentioned, its price is approximately thirty dollars. Aside from explaining some original texts, there is nothing else in it. Although at the back of the book there are more than a hundred short articles, most of them are too subjective, and many of them are not even scriptural. There are many commentaries of the Bible in English, but none of them is perfect. Either they come short in the spiritual interpretation, or they come short in critical analysis. There are many more commentaries that are banned by some denominations. Probably there is not one perfect commentary in the world. To find such a one, you have to go to heaven. As far as my observation is concerned, Darby's Synopsis of the Bible is the best commentary. A set of five books costs ten dollars and can be bought from The Christian Book Room located at 4 Kunsan Garden, Shanghai. Darby does fall into the denominational type of arguments. His study of the Bible is quite deep, and those who read these books have to read them three or four times before they can fully understand their meaning. However, this set still has its shortcomings. It is left to the readers to select them carefully. As far as Chinese commentaries are concerned, either translated or written, most of them are too shallow. This is indeed a pity!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ORGANIZATION</H2><P>Question: When it is necessary for several persons to work together, is it improper to have some kind of organization? Why can it not be considered as a small flock in one accord? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer: Saints can work together without any organization. Barnabas and Paul's preaching of the gospel together is one example of it. We should not consider several persons laboring together to be an organization automatically. We can regard it as a small flock in one accord. However, in working together, it is possible to have organizations or be organizational. This is something that we have to be careful about.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(7)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue Nos. 13, 14</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GIFTS AND TITLES</H2><P>Question:Apostles and pastors are both gifts. But can I say that the word "apostle" can be used as a title also, because the apostles are "ordained"? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer:Yes. The fact that among all the gifts in the church, the apostles are the only ones who are "ordained" makes the apostleship a gift as well as an office. The pastors, however, are different.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BARNABAS</H2><P>Question:Why was Barnabas also called an apostle in Acts 14:14? (Lee, Kiangsu)</P><P>Answer:The word apostle in the original language means a sent one. Paul and Barnabas were both sent by the Holy Spirit to preach the word (13:2). As such, they were apostles (14:14), that is, they were sent ones. The place held by the twelve apostles was not something absolute; Judas could lose his place, and Matthias could take Judas's place. Paul was not one of the twelve. In spite of this, the apostles are the most important kind of people. There are no more apostles now. Only their teachings are left in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXTENT OF THE CHURCH'S AUTHORITY</H2><P>Question:According to Acts 15, it seems that churches in other places were keeping the decrees established by the church in Jerusalem. It seems that there is some kind of control here. (Lee)</P><P>Answer:The Bible does not have such a thing as a federated great church. At the time of the apostles, there was no such thing as the local churches in all the places being joined together to conform to the ordinances of one headquarters church. The Holy Spirit has guarded against this; He does not want any head church. As a result, in the apostles' work, the center was in Antioch, and not in Jerusalem. Paul and Timothy did not commit to the disciples the decree of "the church in Jerusalem." Rather, they committed to them the decree established by "the apostles and elders in Jerusalem." Actually, the decree was established by "the Holy Spirit and...us [the apostles and elders]" (15:28). This is why all the churches have the common responsibility to keep it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COMMANDMENT</H2><P>Question: Does the commandment in Matthew 5:19 refer to the words in Matthew 5:1-12? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes. One thing is certain: The commandment here does not refer to the Ten Commandments. The law in verse 17 is related to the prophets. Hence, it does not refer to the Ten Commandments. The law and the prophets constitute the whole Old Testament. Those brothers who honor the law so much think that the law mentioned in verse 18 refers to the Ten Commandments. But when the Lord went on to expound what He was saying previously, we see that verses 21 and 27 are both in the Ten Commandments, whereas verses 31, 32, 38, and 43 do not come from the laws in the Ten Commandments, but from the books of the law. Hence, the law in verse 18, like the law in verse 17, refers to the books of the law. Since the law in verse 18 does not refer to the law of the Ten Commandments, the law following that in verse 19 should not be the laws of the Ten Commandments either. What the Lord Jesus is saying in verses 17 and 18 is that the prophecies in the Old Testament will not fail, that they will all be fulfilled. The significance of verse 20 is related to the law. To keep the law is to receive the righteousness that grants one an entrance into the kingdom of the heavens; it is to keep the words of verses 1 to 12 and the words of chapters five, six, and seven. Hence, the law here refers to the teachings on the Mount.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE END OF THE AGE</H2><P>Question: Will the work in Matthew 13:40-43 be performed at the time when the Lord descends to earth with His saints? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Not completely. The sowing is the Lord's first coming. The harvest is the rapture of the saints. Verses 41 to 43 concern something that takes place when the Lord comes back to earth with His saints.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TORTURERS</H2><P>Question: Who are the torturers in Matthew 18:34? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: I believe it is Satan. This passage and 1 Corinthians 5:5 mean the same thing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY OF MOSES</H2><P>Question: What is the significance of the angel contending for the body of Moses in Jude 9? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: This happened after the death and burial of Moses (Deut. 34:8, 6). Deuteronomy 34:6 seems to indicate that Moses was not in his sepulcher for long. No other passage can be linked to this place. I myself believe that only the transfiguration on the Mount in Matthew 17 is related to this. Actually, this is the only incident recorded after Moses' death. Satan wanted to stop Moses from putting on his body to appear on the Mount of Transfiguration. Hence, Michael contended with him, according to the nature of his work, which Daniel 12:1-2 shows has to do with resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LIVING CREATURES AND THE ELDERS</H2><P>Question: Do the living creatures in Revelation 4:6 represent all living creatures? Who do the twenty-four elders represent? Why is the number twenty-four? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes, the four living creatures represent all living creatures. The twenty-four elders are the kings and priests among the angels. Their sitting on the throne and their crowns show that they are kings. Their ministering by the incense altar in white garments shows that they are priests. Twenty-four is the number for the divisions of the priesthood (1 Chron. 24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESURRECTION<br>PRIOR TO THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</H2><P>Question: You have said that the rapture is the transformation and the taking up of the living persons. But the two preachers are raptured after they are resurrected. Does that not mean that there will be a resurrection before the blowing of the seventh trumpet (Rev. 11:12)?</P><P>Answer: That is right. The two preachers are special and have nothing to do with the Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RAPTURE AFTER THE SEVENTH TRUMPET</H2><P>Question: You have said that after the seventh trumpet, there will still be a minority of believers on earth. Once they are ready, they will be raptured also. What is the proof of this?</P><P>Answer: The proof of this is in Revelation 11:18, which tells us that by that time there will still be Christians talking about the Lord's coming. In typology, there are the firstfruits, the harvest, and also the gleanings (Lev. 23).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SCROLL</H2><P>Question: Some have said that the scroll mentioned in Revelation 5 signifies the grant deed of a redeemed inheritance. This sounds plausible. What do you think? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes. However, we cannot say this so directly. We will know what the scroll says when it is opened in the future. This scroll is the book of the God who pre-ordained history and who executes what He has ordained according to His wisdom and power. It is not only a prophecy, but the fulfillment of prophecies. The judgment of the world, the redemption of the world, and the ruling of Christ are all contained in this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LOCUSTS</H2><P>Question: Are the things that will come out of the abyss in Revelation 9:1-11 what you have described in The Christian, Issue No. 1? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes, because ordinary locusts do not have kings (Prov. 30:27). However, the locusts in verse 11 have kings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FOUR MESSENGERS</H2><P>Question: What does Revelation 9:14 refer to? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Nothing. The river Euphrates is the boundary of the ancient Roman Empire. It has to do with the revival of the Roman Empire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LITTLE SCROLL</H2><P>Question: Is the little scroll in Revelation 10 the same as the scroll in Revelation 5? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: No. The scroll in chapter five is sealed, whereas the scroll in chapter ten is open. Moreover, the scroll in chapter ten is "little," whereas the scroll in chapter five is new. Hence, one can know it only when he unrolls it (i.e., when he has the revelation). The scroll in chapter ten is open already (i.e., God has revealed it already). All that it takes is to eat it and digest it. The scroll in chapter ten is the prophecies in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WOMAN AND THE MAN-CHILD</H2><P>Question: Does the woman in Revelation 12:1 refer to the Jewish nation? Should the man-child in 12:5 then refer to the Jews who turn back to the Lord during the tribulation? If we interpret it this way, how should we interpret 12:6? (Revelation 12:13 and 16 should be a detailed explanation of 12:4-6.)</P><P>Answer: The woman is the city of Jerusalem, because all the women in this book are cities. Of course, it also refers to the Jewish nation. The man-child is the overcoming believers, because verse 5 matches 2:27. Jerusalem is the birthplace of the church. Verse 5 of chapter twelve is on the rapture of the overcomers. Verses 13-16 are a detailed explanation of verses 4-6, 17. The rest of the seed are the saints who are not raptured. Their having "the testimony of Jesus" proves that they are Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REAPING OF THE SICKLE</H2><P>Question: The reaping with the sickle in Revelation 14:14-16 appears to be a stern treatment. Why is it mentioned in relationship to the rapture? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: The sickle is the unique tool for reaping. It does not denote any sternness. The sickle denotes the angels (Matt. 13:39). This passage must be considered in conjunction with the parable of the wheat and the tares in Matthew 13. The harvest here is the wheat in Matthew 13, and the grapes are the tares in Matthew 13. The harvest is gathered into the "barn." For the disciples, their barn is heaven, because a farmer's barn is not built in the field (the world). Hence, to be gathered into the barn is to be raptured to heaven.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN HEADS</H2><P>Question: How should we interpret Revelation 17:9-11? Some have said that it refers to the few nations after Egypt. (Lee)</P><P>Answer: This has nothing to do with Egypt. This is talking about Rome. The seven heads here are the seven heads of the beast. This beast is the first beast in chapter thirteen. It refers to the last Roman emperor, who is Antichrist, and to his Roman Empire. The seven heads have to do with Rome. There are two interpretations of the seven heads: (1) they refer to a place, and (2) they refer to kings. If they should refer to a place, the seven heads are the "seven mountains," which is the city of Rome, because Rome was built on seven hills and was called "the city of seven hills." If they should refer to kings, the seven heads are the "seven kings." When John wrote Revelation, five of the seven kings (Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero) had died unnatural deaths (that is, "fallen"). One still remained, who was Domitian, and another had not yet come, who is the emperor of the revived Roman Empire. The eighth one is Antichrist himself (v. 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRITS OF THE ONES WHO SINNED</H2><P>Question: According to Issue No. 1 and No. 3 of The Christian, the fallen creatures in the first world became bodiless spirits and have descended into the depths of the sea (the abyss). They have no hope of ever being saved. However, the spirits of the angels who were destroyed by the deluge because of their sins descended into Tartarus (the depths of the earth) and could repent through hearing the gospel. Is this right? (Lee)</P><P>Answer: Yes, that is right.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(8)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><P>Whoever has questions concerning biblical and spiritual problems can write to the editor; we shall do our best to answer. Please forgive us for not answering any unprofitable questions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN PREACHING</H2><P>Question: I have read the question and answer on women preaching, published in March, the fifth issue of your magazine, concerning whether it is proper for women to preach in the meetings. Mr. Chang from Chefoo answered that the Bible considers that it is improper. I wonder if Mr. Chang can tell me in detail the condition of the church age during the apostle Paul's time. Also, I hope you will spend some time to point out to me if it is proper for women to preach in the meeting. I have heard of many brothers and sisters who love the Lord and who have considered this question important and have thought negatively about what you have published in the paper. Some have said that your paper should not be read. I have always loved your paper, and I hope no one is discouraged because of this. Therefore, please forgive me for asking you boldly and directly this question. (Lee, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: All the answers in our paper are written by the editor. The name and places in parenthesis following the questions refer only to the name of the one who asked the question and where he is from. Therefore, the answer in the March issue was not given by Mr. Chang, but by the editor. We appreciate your writing this letter to us, and we truly hope the Lord will bless you for your love toward our paper.</P><P>We assume that you have already read the answers to the several questions concerning women in the eleventh issue. For this reason, it is not necessary for us to speak more. However, we would like to take this opportunity to show our readers our attitude toward all biblical questions. Even though we have not received any other letter questioning or criticizing our paper, we think it is a beneficial thing to have. We deeply feel that the interpretation of the Bible is a great responsibility, and for that reason we cannot help but hold a cautious attitude. The matter of women preaching in the meetings is one that is most controversial among many of God's best children. We do not want to present an ambiguous explanation, because we believe there is only one truth. What we believe is the Bible. Besides the Bible, we do not trust in any human traditions, opinions, or explanations. Even if others accuse us of being heretical, evil, or unscriptural, we must still not compromise. We only know what the Bible actually says. It is a pity that many expository writings of the Bible in these days are but changing the Bible! Many explanations result in some part of the Word being lost. We will never say that we can never be wrong! Even if all others approve us, we will be the last to approve ourselves. It may be that our mistakes are more numerous than those of others! But, dear brothers, we are willing to follow the Bible literally. If we are wrong, we are indeed willing to be corrected. We would ask those who know where we are wrong to please point out to us our mistakes from the teachings of the Bible, and not from the opinions of men. We know that we are not trustworthy. This is why we trust in the Bible. Since we know that we are not trustworthy, we would also ask your forgiveness in our unwillingness to trust in any famous Bible expositor. We admit that the exposition in The Christian is quite different from the traditional interpretations of men. We are definitely not for our readers to follow us blindly. If they do this, it would be better for The Christian to cease its publication. We can only proclaim the truth that we know. Our readers should never think that what The Christian has said can never contain any mistake. We have to tell the brothers frankly that we do not believe we are like the biblical prophets who wrote the Scriptures by divine inspiration. We can make mistakes. Even though those who love The Christian are increasing day by day, perhaps no one is more aware of the shortcomings of the magazine than the editor himself. The Lord also knows our shortcomings. We hope that every reader will check our messages against the teachings of the Bible. If they are the same, then please pay the price to follow these teachings. If they are not the same, we advise you to refuse them totally. Never follow blindly just because you trust The Christian and its editor. Our unique goal is to lead people closer to God's living word and His written Word. If a man can be drawn closer to Christ and to the Bible, our work has received its great reward. I wish that The Christian would simply be something like a pontoon bridge, something that is used and then forgotten, with itself receiving no recognition at all.</P><P>Concerning the question of women, we would like to say a few words. The Bible does not say that women should not preach (1 Cor. 11:5). What the Bible forbids is for women to preach in meetings that have brothers in them (1 Cor. 14:34). Some believers have tried to explain this word by making reference to the situation in the church at Corinth during those days. But (1) the book of 1 Corinthians was not written to the church in Corinth only. Please read 1:2, "To the church of God which is in Corinth...with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place." This epistle is shared by all the churches in "every place." (2) Even if this letter is written to the church in Corinth, does it therefore mean that it has nothing to do with those in this age? If this is so, then which book in the Bible is written to us? (3) Even if it is right to say that we should consider the condition at that time, we should still ask: What was the situation at that time? Is it not true that women preached much in the meetings? If this were not the case, there was surely no need for the teaching in this verse. But, wherever there was the case of women preaching in the meeting, this verse forbids it. Therefore, by considering the situation at the time, we can see that women should not preach, for there are only two possibilities: that the situation then corresponds to what is now, or that the situation then does not correspond to what is now. If it does not correspond to what is now, it means that there were no women preaching, and nothing more need to be said. If it does correspond to what is now, it means that there were women preaching, and it means that the apostle's teaching for Corinth was needful for that place. And if it was needful for that place, it means that the women there should not preach. (4) If this word was spoken only because the custom in Corinth was improper, why then did the apostle say such a word also to Timothy? (5) First Corinthians 14 has answered all the questions: "As in all the churches of the saints, the women should be silent in the churches" (vv. 33-34). What is clearer than this? Not only in Corinth, and not only in any locality in China, but "in all the churches of the saints" throughout the world there should not be women preaching. If this was so in the age of the apostle, how much more should it be so today? (Please read the Spiritual Light Magazine, Vol. 37; Miss Ruth Lee's talk on "Studying the Bible.")</P><P>We can consider this question from another angle. In regard to those women who want to preach in the meetings with brothers present, are they doing this based on the teachings in the Bible? If they are, may I ask where is such a verse in the Bible? If there is no such verse, is it not very dangerous to do such a thing? I will ask yet another question: If such an act is not based on the Bible, are these ones looking for scriptural justification only after they have practiced preaching in meetings with brothers present, or after they have made the decision to do so? If this is the case, naturally they would end up "changing" the Bible. Dear brothers, to me, the teachings of the Bible are not hard to understand. The difficulty lies in the fact that men lack the heart spoken of in John 7:17. Those believers who love the Lord should not do anything without the command of the Bible. Moreover, they should not do something first, and then come back to look for Scriptures that would justify them while covering up the Scriptures that would condemn them. We are not saying that women have no gifts, nor are we saying that their work is not effective. We are merely asking what the Bible teaches. I will not talk of others; I will only speak about myself. I came to the Lord through one sister who prayed for me for many years, and I was brought to the Lord through another older sister. The two persons who helped me the most in my spiritual life are Western sisters. But, dear brothers, this is not a matter of personal feelings, but of the teaching of God's Word. Should women then no longer preach in meetings with brothers present? We dare not answer. All those who are personally involved with this problem should search the Bible themselves.</P><P>Dear sisters, I do not want to offend you because of this question. But I can only say what I know (John 3:11). If you are clear that the Lord wants you to do such (that is, to preach in the meetings), then who am I? How would I dare to oppose your words? I wish you all the best of success, and I hope that the Lord will anoint you with the anointing of the Spirit and will bless you. But my warning is that you would not do anything without realizing what you are doing. I am willing to sit on the last row of a meeting and listen to a sister preaching; I am willing to receive her teaching and am willing to pray for her that her work may be effective. I myself only know the outline and the principle of the Bible. As far as how each individual ought to conduct himself, I hope the Lord Himself will grant each one the leading.</P><P>Brothers, if you think that the Bible forbids women to preach in the meeting, and you come across some women preaching, please be careful and do not oppose it right away. With each individual, we should only and always hold the attitude of, "I do not know anything about others." We should follow closely the teaching of Romans 14:4: "Who are you who judge another's household servant? To his own master he stands,...for the Lord is able to make him stand." We should teach others the principle in the Bible, but we should never judge others (if we already know the teaching) concerning their individual practices. I am willing to let sisters preach in the meetings, but I cannot say that I believe women should preach in the meetings.</P><P>Lastly, we often hear people say that the Lord has exceptions. Due to the failure of the men, God raised up Deborah in the nation of Israel. Therefore, in today's church we can also have exceptions such as this. For now, we will not say whether it was right or wrong for Deborah to be a judge. For the sake of simplicity, let us say that it was right. But how many Deborahs are there? It is true that the failure of the brothers today is the saddest story. Perhaps God needs to raise up a new Deborah to do the work. But then, women of Israel, please do not say that every one of you is a Deborah. God may have the authority to do something, but do not take His special way as a teaching. You should all ask yourselves: Has God exercised such an authority? Has He granted me such authority? Does God want me to preach specifically in a meeting with brothers present? If He does, may God bless your work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</H2><P>Question: I read the question and answer column of the eleventh issue of your paper and saw the question from Mr. Chien from Changchou concerning the resurrection of the saints of old. Will you explain to me whether there is a contradiction between the word in Matthew 27:52 and that in 1 Corinthians 15:20? In your reply, you said that the Lord Jesus was not the first one to resurrect, and that Elisha and the Lord both had called someone back to life. Although you explained at the end that "the Lord is the only one who resurrected in such a way," this kind of answer is bound to create misunderstanding. I am afraid people would think the resurrection of the Lord and the resurrection of those whom the Lord and Elisha raised up are all the same. In my opinion, the people raised up by Elijah, by Elisha, and by the Lord Jesus were not a resurrection of the spiritual body such as will be in the future; they were merely a return of the soul to the body after the person had died. These people lived a few more years on earth, but in the end they still died like other people. The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is indeed the first one, in that He was the first one who had resurrected with a spiritual body (1 Cor. 15:20). The saints mentioned in Matthew 27:52, in my opinion, also resurrected with a spiritual body. This can be proved from verse 53 which says that these ones came out only after the Lord's rising from the tomb, which means that no one was able to resurrect before the Lord Jesus did. The words "appeared to many" prove that their resurrection was not of the physical body, but of the spiritual body. From this, we can see the power of death. Without the Lord's crushing of this power, even when others were able to rise up from their graves, they were still not able to come out of the tombs. Perhaps some think that such an interpretation of Matthew 27:52 would contradict the word that says the saints will resurrect only at the last trumpet. I think this is a special case in the Bible. God's purpose for doing this is to testify to the resurrection of the Lord. Normally, believers will not resurrect until the sounding of the last trumpet. Is this explanation correct? I humbly await your judgment. (Lee, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: Even the most learned servants of God cannot agree on whether the people who were raised from the dead by the Old Testament prophets and by the Lord Jesus on earth, as well as the saints in Matthew 27, were all resurrected with a spiritual body. Hence, it is difficult to say anything definitely. Since this point does not have much to do with our spiritual life in our present experience, we can only let it go. If you think that the Lord Jesus was the first one to resurrect with a spiritual body, what you have said goes all the more to prove my word, "the Lord is the only one who resurrected in such a way"! Such an answer shows that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was different from the resurrection of those whom Elisha and the Lord raised up. The phrase, "in such a way," suggests that it was special. Praise the Lord, because He is the first in all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AZAZEL</H2><P>Question: The Azazel mentioned in Leviticus 16:8 refers to whom? Someone said that it refers to Satan. I hope you can tell me; I would be very grateful. (Chang, Ningpo)</P><P>Answer: Some people, like Scofield, think that it refers to Christ, like the two birds in chapter fourteen. But I myself believe that Azazel is Satan. Some biblical scholars think that Azazel was the name of an idol. In verse 8, Azazel was put in opposition to Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONE ON THE WHITE HORSE</H2><P>Question:What does Revelation 6:2 refer to? (Wu, Kiangsi)</P><P>Answer:God's children have very divergent opinions concerning this point. The three most common viewpoints are: (1) This is Christ. He is commencing to judge, just as is mentioned in Revelation 19:19. (2) This is Antichrist. This is based on the order of Matthew 24. The white horse, the red horse, and the black horse stand in contrast to Antichrist, war, and famine. (3) This is the gospel; the vision depicts the long-term victory of the gospel in this age. We cannot make an absolute judgment concerning the interpretation of these Scriptures. We can choose to believe what we have seen, but we must never presume that others are all wrong. Unless for special spiritual reasons, we should always maintain the attitude that what we know is very limited.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUNDAY</H2><P>Question: Someone asked, "Is it God's commandment that we observe Sunday?" I cannot answer from the Bible. Please instruct me. (Yang, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: Indeed, you cannot use the Bible to answer him. I am afraid that no honest Bible expositor can answer him either! I cannot find any commandment in the Bible that says we should "observe" Sunday! Please do not misunderstand by thinking that we should observe Saturday; there is no such thing either. I have not found any passage in the Bible that says that Christians should observe Saturday! What does this mean? The Sabbath day (that is, Saturday) belongs to the law. But we, the Gentiles, are not under the law. (1) Before we believed in the Lord, we were "Gentiles, who have no law" (Rom. 2:14). (2) After we believed in the Lord, the apostle said that "you are not under the law" (6:14). However, "whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law" (3:19). If those brothers who insist that we observe the Sabbath cannot prove to us that the Sabbath is not of the law, they cannot ask us to keep it. The more they say that the Sabbath is important for the reason that it is a crucial commandment of the law, the more it means that we should not keep it! But there are those who commit the same mistake as the zealous Sabbath-keepers; they are the Sunday-observers (actually the Lord's Day-observers). (1) They think that because the apostles met on this day, we should therefore "observe" this day. But, why did the apostles only gather on this day, whereas these ones would change it to mean they have to observe this day? (2) They think that after the Lord Jesus died, under the New Testament, the Sabbath is changed from Saturday to Sunday. But where does the Bible say this? (3) They think that the Lord's Day is the "Christian Sabbath." In many denominations the Ten Commandments are still held high, and the members are exhorted to keep the Sabbath faithfully. However, the Sabbath is clearly the seventh day, which is today's Saturday. How can they swap things around and make the first day of the week (that is, our Sunday) the Sabbath day? It is no wonder that when we make the truth clear to those who are zealous for Saturday, their denominations lose many members. We do not have to go into detail on this. All the arguments by these denominations of making Sunday the Sabbath Day have been totally refuted by the Seventh Day Adventists already. According to our study of the Bible, the Sabbath-keepers are wrong, and the Sunday-observers are also wrong. Both are wrong. The Sabbath-keepers lead Christians to a position that is fully under the law, while the Sunday-observers are leading Christians to a position that is a mixture of law and grace. Of the two, the latter is more dangerous. It is very clear to everyone that the Bible has not commanded the New Testament believers to keep the Sabbath. But where in the Bible are Christians asked to keep the Lord's Day? We have to say that there is not one verse in the Bible which says this. Before going on, let me first explain the meaning of the expression "observing Sunday." To observe Sunday is to stop working or doing any business on Sunday. On this day the shopkeepers should close their shops to observe the day. But may I ask those in the denominations, "Why do you observe Sunday this way? Why should believers not buy and sell on Sunday, and why should they not do what they do on the other weekdays?" These ones would unanimously answer, "Does not the fourth commandment tell us that we should rest on this day?" Brothers, consider what a confusion this is! If you ask these ones further which day does the fourth commandment refer to, they have to say that it refers to the Sabbath day. But which day is the Sabbath day? It is Saturday. Which day are they observing? They are observing Sunday. Please note that the regulation of the fourth commandment is with regard to Saturday. But what people are observing today is Sunday. What is the reason for basing one's observance of Sunday on a regulation that governs Saturday? Why change from Saturday to Sunday, while keeping the regulations governing Saturday? The Sunday observers cannot answer these questions. They realize that in the age of grace there is no more need to keep the Sabbath. But while they observe the Lord's Day, they are still being bound by the Sabbath regulations. What advantage is there to change the seventh day to the first day? This kind of behavior is mindless, meaningless, illogical, contrary to grace, contrary to the law, and unscriptural. What is the scriptural teaching concerning the keeping of days? The Bible has not commanded Christians to "observe" any day. No, absolutely none. According to the example and teaching of the Bible, on the Lord's Day (i.e., Sunday), Christians should (1) rejoice and be glad (Psa. 118:24), (2) meet and break bread (Acts 20:7), and (3) make offerings (1 Cor. 16:2). These are the things that Christians should do. This day is the "Lord's Day" (Rev. 1:10). Hence, we should act according to the Lord's will. As to what should not be done, the Bible does not have a single word concerning it. Many of the present day regulations are human traditions. If one should not buy and sell on the Lord's Day, he should not do the same on all the other days as well. It is because men do not understand that the gospel teaches men to do everything in their daily lives for God that there are such errors. The conclusion is that Christians should not observe the Sabbath, and they should not observe Sunday. However, on the Lord's Day (i.e., Sunday), they should rejoice and be glad, meet and break bread, and make offerings. This question has bewildered many and has caused loss to the poor believers who would otherwise work on the Lord's Day, but who refrain from working under the fear that they would offend the Lord. For this reason, I have said a little more on the subject. The consciences of many people are made weak through human traditions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JUDAS</H2><P>Question: I have read the tenth issue of The Christian, which said that believers who are saved are eternally saved. It divided believers into three classes: Those who are being rewarded, those who will not be rewarded, and those who will be punished. I really admire your explanations, which are all according to the Bible. According to the above explanation, what would you say about Judas Iscariot, about Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5, and about Simon the sorcerer in chapter eight? Please instruct me in detail. (Yang, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: With regard to Judas Iscariot, it should not be hard after hearing the Lord's words for one to see his outcome. He was the "son of perdition" (John 17:12). As for Ananias and Sapphira, if they were among "the multitude of those who had believed" (Acts 4:32), even though they were delivered to Satan for the destruction of their flesh, yet this was for the purpose that their spirit would be saved in the day of the Lord (1 Cor. 5:5). Simon was a saved person. In Acts 8:13 it says, "And even Simon himself believed, and...he had been baptized"; Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved." One thing is most important: We ourselves should believe in the Lord and be saved. For those who are still living on this earth and are not yet saved, we should do our best to preach the gospel to them, so that they would believe and be saved. As for the dead ones, whether or not they are saved is in God's hand; we should not worry about them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DELIVERED TO SATAN</H2><P>Question: Every time I read 1 Corinthians 5:5, there are always doubts arising in my heart. Since the word says to "deliver such a one to Satan," how can he also be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus? Please tell me, in what way is one delivered unto Satan? (Chang, Ningpo)</P><P>Answer: Please forgive me for not answering your question until this issue! The one who was to be delivered to Satan and whom the apostle spoke about here was the believer who had committed adultery. He was a "brother" already (v. 11). Hence, he was saved and one who belonged to the Lord. Again, if we look at the words in verses 7 and 8, we know that this man already had Jesus Christ as the Passover Lamb, but he did not keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Because he trusted in the precious blood, he was saved. The problem was that he had not purged his sins. Once a person is saved, he is saved forever. The apostle had only delivered his body to Satan; his spirit and soul still belong to the Lord. The body of the believers should be under God's protection. Satan always loves to murder the believers, but God's hand is always restricting Satan. However, when God's hand is removed, Satan will immediately do his work (cf. the story of Job). Therefore, the delivering of this one to Satan was the removing of God's hand; God no longer restricted Satan from working on him. This man would suffer the destruction by Satan to his flesh. He would even die, as a warning for him. A sinner finds pleasure in his flesh. Hence, his flesh should suffer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTIZE INTO WHAT NAME</H2><P>Question: I have read the testimony of Mrs. Y. R. in your magazine, but I still have some questions. Please instruct me in the love of the Lord. In Matthew 3:13 the baptism the Lord Jesus received from John was by water (it did not mention in whose name). In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus commanded the disciples to baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. In Acts 19 the Ephesians had received the baptism of John (by immersion); in verse 5, they were baptized again (by immersion?), but there Paul only baptized them in the name of the Lord (different from the command given by the Lord Jesus). Apparently, the apostles could baptize people in the name of the Lord Jesus alone. In Acts 9 Ananias of Damascus was a disciple. He baptized Paul in the name of the Lord only. If we read Acts carefully, we see that everyone was baptized only in the name of the Lord. What then is the baptism we now receive? Whose baptism is it? Is it John's baptism, or the Lord Jesus' baptism, or both? Do those who baptize people do so in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, or in the name of the Lord Jesus only? Or are both permissible? (Lee, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: The baptism we now receive is not the baptism of John because although John was "the lamp that was burning and shining," people rejoiced only "for a while in his light" (John 5:35). Acts 19 is sufficient to prove this point. The Bible does not say whose baptism we are now receiving. Romans 6 merely states that we are baptized into the Lord's death. Matthew 28:19 says that we are baptized "into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." We see that those who care much about rituals merely recite this phrase when they baptize people! Actually, this is not a ceremony, but the declaration of a fact. It is a pity that this line is used by the denominations as a litany of baptism, a line which one reads at the time of baptism. When we read the acts of the apostles in Acts (8:16; 10:48; 19:5), we find further proof of what we have said. In the Bible, there is not one record of men being baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, every time Acts mentions the name, it is always the name of the Lord Jesus. However, this does not mean that the matter should be practiced ritualistically, in the way that men today are doing. The reason for this is that sometimes the Bible also mentions the name of "the Lord Jesus" (8:16; 19:5) and also the name of "Jesus Christ" (2:38; 10:48). Therefore, baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus, and a person is baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INFANT BAPTISM</H2><P>Question: I was baptized as an infant, but infant baptism is never mentioned anywhere in God's Word (the Bible). As I was growing up, my parents told me that I had already received baptism and had no need to be baptized again, and that the position I held was already that of a disciple of the Lord. If I pass another examination, I could be received into the communion. I believe that this is something man has added to the Bible, and I believe that this does not agree with the Bible. Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved." This shows that baptism should come after believing. However, if one dies during childhood, he is saved already and no longer has any need for such an act, because at that age a child does not know what it is to believe and does not even know the difference between the left hand and the right. We can say that children have no sin. To be baptized is to wash away one's sins (Acts 22:16). If infants are baptized, what are they washing away? Is it true that those who have been baptized in this way should be baptized again? (Lee, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: Acts 19 answers this for you. But, brother, your question contains a little error. You asked, "Is it true that those who have been baptized in this way should be baptized again?" The word "again" is not appropriate. Since you know that there is no such thing as infant baptism in the Bible, then infant baptism is not scriptural and does not count according to the Bible. Hence, "those who have been baptized in this way" have, in the eyes of God, never been baptized. If he does get baptized, that will be his first baptism, and not his being baptized again. Your question should be stated this way: Should one who has not been baptized be baptized? After you have put the question this way, you should be able to find out the answer by yourself from the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE "TRUE JESUS CHURCH"</H2><P>Question: The "True Jesus Church" was recently raised up in our country. What is its goal? I read about it in the Spiritual Paper and was quite amazed by it. Please tell me about it. (Wang, Fuding)</P><P>Answer: Based on what I know, the True Jesus Church is a church which emphasizes very much the baptism of the Holy Spirit; it is a branch of the modern Pentecostal movement. The errors within this movement are many and are far more numerous than those within the Seventh Day Adventists. I will briefly point out to you several of their errors: (1) their claim that the baptism of the Holy Spirit must be accompanied by the speaking in tongues, (2) their claim that baptism can heal sickness, (3) the hallelujah prayers, (4) the name of the church, (5) the organization of the church, (6) their confusion on the cardinal truth concerning salvation, and (7) the keeping of the Sabbath. The most pitiful thing is that many believers are not so clear concerning the work of the Holy Spirit. As a result, they are cheated thoroughly. Even if a believer does not know anything else, at least he should know the teaching of Ephesians 1:13-14. Every believer, as soon as he believes the gospel, is sealed with the Holy Spirit. According to these two verses, all those who have believed in the gospel have the Holy Spirit already. Moreover, this Spirit will never leave them, but will be with them until the day of redemption (4:30). Therefore, a believer has no need to receive the Spirit as something he does not yet possess. Instead, he needs to obey the Spirit which he already has received. Concerning things supernatural, they can be from God, but they can also be from Satan. Not only so, Satan is the one who pretends to be the angel of light. The miracles that Satan performs can have the best appearance and effect. Our space is limited, and we cannot say too much. Nevertheless, the test of 1 John 4:1-3 is absolutely necessary.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WITHDRAWING FROM DENOMINATIONS</H2><P>Question: I am working in the Independent Church, and I feel restricted. All the rituals there are mostly based on man's ideas. I desire to work by myself, freely, and not to participate in any denominations, but I do not know if this is permissible. (Wang, Fuding)</P><P>Answer: May the Lord Himself lead you personally. Please pray much before the Lord, that you may know His will, before you make any move. Naturally, all faithful children of God see many unscriptural things in the denominations. But I wish everyone would not just listen to the opinions of others, nor merely see things with their own eyes, but would truly receive God's revelation in the Spirit to see through the emptiness of man's tradition. Otherwise, "that which is born of the flesh is flesh." There are at least three present dangers to the children of God concerning the question of denominations: (1) They follow the traditions of men and would not change. (2) They oppose the traditions of men and adopt the attitude of the modernists. Such is the case with those who advocate indigenous churches. (3) They oppose the traditions of men and fall into heresies, such as the Seventh Day Adventists and the True Jesus Church. Strictly speaking, although all three cases are dangerous, the last two are more dangerous than the first. It is safer to keep the traditions in the denominations (the first way). The real way, however, is to read God's Word in God's presence and resolve to obey. The testimony of the Bible is what we should follow. (This answers both Mr. Chen and Mr. Fan.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PROBLEM</H2><P>Question: Sometimes in my spirit, because of God's mercy, I can see His hand working in every way. During these times, even though I have hardships and opposition, my heart is full of praise, thanksgiving, and joy. It is as if I desire no one besides the Lord. Sometimes I lose this kind of vision. Even though I still love the Lord and desire the Lord, my heart feels lost, as if I am in a thick fog. This kind of up-and-down living comes and goes. I hope that you will teach your foolish brother in the Lord how to keep the sight that I have received. (Lee, Anhwei)</P><P>Answer: Dear brother, I am really happy because you are now on the way to spiritual life. May God bless you. However, you should remain humble. What we need is death. If we are dead, all is well. Brother, I cannot teach you "how to keep this sight you have received." What I can say to you is that you should be willing to lose "this sight you have received." Please remember, "For we walk by faith, not by appearance" (2 Cor. 5:7). "The righteous shall have life and live by faith" (Rom. 1:17), and not by feeling or sight. Faith is to disregard feeling and sight. We need to learn to believe in the Lord even when we are in the darkness, that is, when we do not have any feeling or sight. We should live by this faith. This means that our spiritual life is one which believes in God, and not one which senses God or sees God. The spiritual life of a believer is far deeper than sight or senses. Please do not think that because you have those kinds of praises, thanksgivings, and feelings and sights of joy that you are at the height of your spiritual life. No, these are not spiritual living; these are merely what you see and feel. You may ask, "Is not a man's life dependent on what he feels and sees?" You have to realize that these are merely the feelings in your soul; they are not your true spiritual life. The most important thing that we should know is that true spirituality depends on man's will, rather than on his emotions. If your will consistently, constantly, and continuously (1) wills, (2) determines, and (3) chooses that which is of God and even God Himself, you are already living a spiritual life. Your emotions are unreliable. Indeed, they are like the waves. But you can abide peacefully by your will. If you seek after and grasp the sight you have received, you will be up and down all the time. What God wants to give is not a happy feeling every day. His purpose is for you to live by your will and your spirit. "I love the Lord, not because of what I feel, but because I want to love Him." Just as we would read the Bible, pray, preach, and serve the Lord when we are joyful, in the same way we should read the Bible, pray, preach, and serve Him when we do not feel anything and our heart is as cold as ice. Please understand that the most important thing is to live by the will and not by the emotions. You should never think that just because you do not have happy, wonderful feelings, you are therefore defeated. No, that is only your feeling; it is not real. I am afraid there is nothing in this world that is as undependable as our feelings. But what a pity that the thing that believers desire the most is wonderful feelings. The most deceiving thing is for a person to take his feelings as an indicator of his spiritual life. From now on, please learn to exercise your will to control your whole being and your feelings. If God rewards you with feelings, thank Him. If He does not and you feel lost at heart, go on as usual. Whatever you do when you have high feelings, do the same when you do not have these feelings. Quietly submit yourself to your will, and do not fluctuate through your feelings. Until you have overcome your habit of living by your feelings, God cannot greatly use you. He needs solid vessels, those who do not change due to circumstances. If you go on putting aside your feelings, you will find that you will live less by your feelings, and you will find your will becoming stronger and stronger.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(9)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 20</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SABBATH,<br>HOLY COMMUNION, AND BAPTISM</H2><P>Question: Recently, some churches have proposed that one should not keep the Sabbath on the day of resurrection. It is not God's will in the Bible that we observe the day of resurrection. In taking the holy communion, we should use unleavened bread and grape juice and should not have anything else as a substitute. Baptism should be by immersion and not by sprinkling. It is better to have foot-washing at the same time we have the baptism. (Wang)</P><P>Answer: We can only follow the Bible in everything we do. Other than the Bible, no other human words should move our hearts.</P><P>(1)Please note that we are not "keeping the Sabbath on the day of resurrection." Christians do not keep the Sabbath. To say that Christians should keep the Sabbath is an anti-scriptural expression. Where in the Bible does it say that Christians should keep any Sabbath? We should know that with Christians there is no Sabbath. We only come together to meet and to break the bread (Acts 20:7), to make our offerings (1 Cor. 16:1-2), and to rejoice (Psa. 118:24) on the first day of the week, which is the day of resurrection, the Lord's Day, according to the commandment and example of the Scriptures. Other than these, whether or not it is a Sabbath, whether or not we should do business or work on this day, are all questions related to the Jews and have nothing to do with us Christians. It is a pity that there are too many Old Testament Christians!</P><P>(2)The Bible does not have the words holy communion. This is a product of the Roman Catholic Church and a term left over from the denominations. The Bible only says the "supper" (1 Cor. 11). Of course, our emphasis is not on the rituals, but as much as possible we should use unleavened bread and grape juice. No doubt that was what the Lord used on the night of His betrayal. To follow the Scripture in this way will leave no doubt in the hearts of the weak brothers.</P><P>(3)All the baptisms in the Bible are water baptisms. Hence, sprinkling is unscriptural. All those who have not been baptized in the scriptural way have not been baptized at all. Here we need to add another word: baptism alone will not save a person. But in order to belong to the Lord fully, a person has to act fully according to the Scriptures.</P><P>(4)Foot-washing is not a ceremony. Personally, I believe that foot-washing should be practiced. What is needed in foot-washing is humility, selflessness, love, and obedience. If we do not have these things, it is better that we do not practice foot-washing. To interpret the Bible spiritually does not thereby annul the commandments of the Bible. As to whether one should have the foot-washing after baptism, I do not see such a commandment in the Bible. If the saints consider foot-washing a kind of ritual, it is better that they do not practice it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SCOFIELD</H2><P>Question: In what teachings are yours different from those of Mr. Scofield? (Kuo)</P><P>Answer: Mr. Scofield's teachings are generally the same as ours. The differences we have with Mr. Scofield are merely on a few questions related to the Sermon on the Mount, the rapture, and the kingdom. To me, the Sermon on the Mount is what Christians ought to keep, the rapture will take place only in the case of the watchful and waiting ones, and not all those who have received eternal life will enter the kingdom to reign with the Lord. Mr. Scofield does not believe this way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DAVID'S PLACE AMONG HIS BROTHERS</H2><P>Question: Is David the seventh or the eighth son of Jesse? First Samuel 16:10 and 11 say that Jesse called his seven sons to pass before Samuel, none of whom were chosen. When he was asked if he had more sons, he answered that there was still the youngest one, who must therefore have been the eighth son. But 1 Chronicles 2:13-15 records the names of the sons of Jesse, and David is ranked as the seventh. The two places are different. Why is this so? (Lin)</P><P>Answer: According to the order of birth, David was the eighth son of Jesse. There is a reason why he was called the seventh son. First Samuel 16 was recorded when David was young. At that time, all his brothers were alive, and he was the eighth son. First Chronicles was recorded at the time David became king. One of his brothers had died and had no children. His name was therefore removed from the record of the Israelites. As such was the case, David became the seventh son.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ELISHA</H2><P>Question: I read 2 Kings 6:8-19 which says that the Syrians surrounded Dothan not for the sake of the Israelites, but to look for Elisha. When the Syrians reached Dothan, why did Elisha say, "This is not the way, neither is this the city"? Was not the man of God lying? Please instruct me. (Yin)</P><P>Answer: Elisha was a Samaritan. What he said to the Syrians was not deceiving them, because he led them to Samaria, that is, "to the man whom ye seek" (v. 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FOURTH GENERATION</H2><P>Question: I read Genesis 15:16, which says, "But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again." What is this fourth generation? Please answer. (Tsui)</P><P>Answer: This means that by the fourth generation the Israelites were slaves in Egypt, they would be led out of Egypt. This was literally fulfilled later. When we read Exodus 6:16-20, we see that Levi was the first generation (v. 16), Kohath, the second generation (v. 16), Amram, the third generation (v. 18), and Aaron and Moses, the fourth generation (v. 20). It was at the time of Aaron and Moses that the children of Israel left Egypt for Canaan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HOLY SPIRIT SPEAKING</H2><P>Question: How does the Holy Spirit speak to man? (Acts 8:29). (Hsu)</P><P>Answer: The Holy Spirit speaks to man through the intuition in his spirit. A person cannot hear Him with his physical ears, nor can he fathom Him with his mind. He can only hear Him through his intuition. We should pay special attention to this matter at present. The intellectual ones seek after the mind of the Spirit with their mind. The zealous ones who lack scriptural knowledge and deep spiritual life try to listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit with their physical ears. These will lead people down the path of error. These are the ones who are deceived by Satan. All of the Holy Spirit's works are in our spirit (Rom. 8:16). Besides his soul, man still has a spirit. The greatest faculty of the spirit is the intuition. The intuition is the direct sense within man's spirit. It is not a physical sense, nor a thought in the mind, but an independent feeling that does not come from any source. The voice of the Holy Spirit can be detected in the intuition. If believers today do not serve the Lord through following the intuition, they will trespass the Lord's will often.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENDURING TO THE END</H2><P>Question: Matthew 24:13. Will those who do not endure to the end be saved? What kind of salvation does this refer to? (Weigh)</P><P>Answer: Of course not. This does not refer to the salvation of the spirit of the believers. Rather, it refers to the salvation of the body of the Jews during the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE QUEEN OF THE SOUTH</H2><P>Question: What does the "queen of the south" in Luke 11:31 refer to? (Tsui)</P><P>Answer: It refers to the queen of Sheba in the Old Testament (2 Chron. 9:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS,</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1> THE KINGDOM OF GOD, AND HEAVEN</H2><P>Question: What are the differences between the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God, and heaven? (Tsui)</P><P>Answer: There are differences. The kingdom of the heavens is God's present administration among His children. This will be much developed in the millennial kingdom. By that time, the believers will reign with the Lord Jesus. The kingdom of God is God's rule from eternity to eternity. The kingdom of the heavens is included in the kingdom of God. Heaven is where the Lord Jesus is now and where the believers will go in the future.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>"WAS" AND "BECAME"</H2><P>Question: Is the word "was" in Genesis 1:2 the same in the original language as the word "became" in 19:26? (Weigh)</P><P>Answer: Yes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BIBLE AND THE CURRENT OF THE AGE</H2><P>Question: I have believed in the Lord for many years, but have not received much enlightening. Recently, I read a newspaper that said that under the tide of revolution those who are involved with missionary works in the church should join the anti-Christian movement. Some have even said that any fundamental biblical teaching that is not in conformity to the current of the age should be criticized. I feel that this is too much devaluating of the worth of the Bible. Our church is also much affected. Because I feel ill at ease at heart, I dare to ask about your opinion. (Wang Yu-ting)</P><P>Answer: After reading your letter, I know what you are talking about. The things that you described are commonly seen everywhere. Of course, there is no need for outsiders to oppose and investigate the sins in the church; we have to rise up to oppose them ourselves. As to the point that the fundamental teachings of the Bible do not match those of the current of the age, my opinion is that the Bible has never matched the current of any age! We should correct the unscriptural currents with the Scriptures, rather than criticize the Scriptures by the unscriptural currents. The truth is always the same and should not change with the current of the age. If Christians should follow the current of the age, does that mean that our faith and conduct should change with the ever-changing current of the age?</P><P>As far as the church itself is concerned, I think that the biblical teaching is that we should submit ourselves to the local government (Rom. 13). A Christian should "submit" to his government absolutely. But he does not necessarily have to "obey." The Bible only requires that we submit; it does not require that we obey. Whatever the reasons may be, we have to submit. But we can only obey what is not contrary to the commandment of God. Others can kill us or punish us, but we cannot rebel. However, we will only obey that which the Bible allows us to do. A Christian should be a follower of the Lord as well as a citizen of a state.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALARIES OF PREACHERS</H2><P>Question: Is it unscriptural for preachers to receive a fixed salary? How do you trust in the Lord in your preaching? How does the Lord supply your need? What is your experience? Please share with us so we can follow. If I do not have enough faith, can I conduct business, on the one hand, and preach at the same time?</P><P>Answer: Neither in the Old Testament nor in the New is there such a thing as God's servant receiving a fixed salary. Even the priests in the Old Testament lived by the altar. If the Israelites were to become rebellious, the priests would suffer starvation. The apostles were those who had neither gold nor silver (Acts 3:6), much less money to hire servants. The question is whose servants we are. If we are God's servants, surely we have to ask God for our salary. Otherwise, we should ask man or the denominations for our salary.</P><P>It is not convenient for me to go into my personal experience here. But one thing I can say: during the past few years, I have trusted only in God and have never suffered any lack. There is no excess, but there is also no lack. The heavenly manna comes every day, and it is never short of supply. The Father's raven flies everywhere, and it comes uninvited.</P><P>Actually, it is more appropriate to conduct business and preach at the same time than to be a salaried preacher. But it would be a pity if anyone chooses to do it because of a lack of faith. God's commandment is that we trust in Him. What we need to ask is whether God has called us to the work of preaching. If He has, He should be responsible for our supply. The waters in the Jordan do not separate first to expose the dry ground. Rather, you have to put your feet forward first, before the waters will part. The secret in the way of faith is to trust in God alone and not to worry about tomorrow. As long as today is cared for, we can praise the Lord. There is no need to worry about tomorrow, next month, next year, or ten years from now. If we worry about these things, we will be afraid. We should trust in God day by day.</P><P>One thing that grieves me today is that too little do believers receive answers to prayers. Perhaps it is because they pray too little. It seems as if it is a rare occurrence to receive answers to prayers and that it is normal for there to be no answer to prayer! We should know God. God should have the chance to daily prove to us how real He is and how real His promises are. We should see that God's heart and His hands as well are for us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONDITION FOR RAPTURE</H2><P>Question: Can believers who have reached the stage of sanctification and who have the Lord's resurrection life still working in them be raptured? When the Lord comes, is it true that only the spiritual believers will be raptured and that the fleshly believers will go through the tribulation? (Kuo)</P><P>Answer: The condition for rapture has been clearly given in the Scriptures (Rev. 3:10; Luke 21:36). We also believe that a spirit of rapture is a forerunner to the actual rapture. We dare not say to what stage a person has to be before he can be raptured. But I believe that fleshly believers will have to go through the tribulation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHRISTIAN AND MISSIONARY ALLIANCE</H2><P>Question: Is the Christian and Missionary Alliance the same in nature as all the other denominations? (Kuo)</P><P>Answer: In order to answer this question, one must first know what is a sect. There are a few elements to a sect: (1) a name, (2) a charter other than the Bible (whether scriptural or not), and (3) not including all regenerated believers. When Mr. Simpson founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance, we know that he was full of spiritual power. Even today, the Christian and Missionary Alliance is one of the best denominations. But unfortunately, it is still a denomination, because (1) it has a name, (2) it has a special fourfold gospel, and (3) its system does not include all regenerated believers. Brothers, what we are concerned about today is not a question of good denominations versus bad denominations, but a question of sectarianism versus nonsectarianism.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S GRACE</H2><P>Question: Since many organized denominations are hated by the Lord, why does the Lord bless them still, work with them, and even save many through them? Please explain. (Kuo)</P><P>Answer: It is a pitiful fact that God's children do restrict Him. God's work with His children is according to the measure of ground His children afford Him. God can only work as much as He is given the ground to work. Hence, although many organizations (and many other things besides organizations) are not approved by Him, the fact that there is still need for saving people means that God will still work with these organizations to save people. We know that God fully disapproves of Roman Catholicism. But there are those in Catholicism who are saved and are even saving others. However, we cannot become Catholic believers just because of this. We have given the Holy Spirit too much limitation! May God be merciful to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INSTITUTING CHURCH SYSTEMS</H2><P>Question: If there are to be organizations or systems, how should we institute them without acting contrary to the Scripture and being entangled in human organizations? (Kuo)</P><P>Answer: The Bible has decreed all institutions of the church in a clear way already. We must never have any decrees, whether they are creeds, constitutions, rules, charters, or ordinances outside the Bible, no matter how scriptural they may appear. Otherwise, we will become a sect right away. We may be more scriptural and more knowledgeable than other sects but still be a sect. We should only have one open Bible now for men to follow. If we institute anything outside the Bible, no matter how scriptural it may appear, we are causing others to despise the Bible and turning their attention to the instituted ordinances. In this way, those who are "of our group" must abide by the teachings of these ordinances before they can meet together. Of course, if anyone sees any ordinance that is contrary to the Scriptures, he should reject it. Of course, we should teach others the teachings of the Bible. But if anyone follows these teachings, they are following the Lord's word, not any kind of authority in our word. If we institute anything, our institution will become the standard of our faith. This means that we will be setting up another standard of faith besides the Bible, no matter how scriptural such a standard may appear.</P><P>The institution of any ordinance carries with it one of two characteristics: either it is authoritative, or it is nothing. Something that is authoritative means that it ought to be observed and that it is unalterable. If such ordinances are to be authoritative, what happens when they contain mistakes? Even if they do not contain any mistakes, can they possibly be perfect? On the other hand, if such ordinances are non-authoritative, and someone can correct whatever is wrong and add whatever is lacking, what good will these ordinances do? Is it not redundant to have another page outside the Bible?</P><P>The only scriptural way now is to allow God's word to lead the believers personally. Of course, human opinions and ideas can never be the same. But the Holy Spirit will never give two contradicting interpretations to anyone. If there is any mistake, it lies on man's side. John 7:17 is the root of all problems. If believers would reject their self-will, submit to the Holy Spirit, and respect one another and wait on one another, the one accord can be achieved. If there are self-will and self-opinions, even when a person has outwardly left the sects, he is inwardly still in the sects, and there will still be disputes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHURCH ORGANIZATION</H2><P>Question: If there should not be any organization or system in the church, how can the church be administrated? (Wang)</P><P>Answer: What we propose is that everything invented by man and not instituted by God should be removed. We should not follow anything other than the Bible.</P><P>We are not saying that the Bible tells us that the church is without any organization or system. We are merely saying that the present church organizations and systems are not scriptural. According to the Scriptures, the present church organizations and systems contain the following errors: (1) a denominational name, (2) different methods of organizations, (3) the system of a pastor presiding over a church, (4) meetings in which one man replaces the function of everyone else, and (5) ordination. These are only the major items.</P><P>With respect to the question of church administration, in the beginning this was under the Lord Jesus as the Head and carried out through the Holy Spirit and by means of the apostles and the elders (see Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22; 16:4; 21:18; 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-2). The elders are appointed by the apostles (read Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 3; Titus 1:5). If we cannot prove the existence of apostles today, how can we have elders? Although we cannot find any reason from the Bible to show us why there are no apostles today, it is almost certain that there are no more apostles today. If this is the case, surely there are no more elders today, because they are appointed by the apostles. If there are no apostles and there are no elders, does this not mean that the church administration is over? This is what you are concerned about. God's provision and arrangement, however, are not only for normal times, but for the times of failure and the degradation of the church as well. Please read 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13; Hebrews 13:7; 1 Corinthians 16:15-16. These few verses do not mention the office of eldership, but they mention the work of the elders. Hence, in the present age of desolation we do not have official elders. However, the Lord will raise up among those who are meeting under His name in all the places men who can be elders. They will oversee and will manage, but they will not have the title of elders.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Question: How do you explain Matthew 18:18 and John 20:23? Some have said that these words were added in the Middle Ages and were not proposed by the Lord Jesus Himself. How do you feel? Please answer me in The Christian. (Tsui)</P><P>Answer: These two verses are in the reliable manuscripts. There is no basis to say that they were added during the Middle Ages. The teaching in these verses is true. The Lord introduces His words in Matthew with the words, "Truly I say to you." This shows their importance. These two verses are on the excommunication of believers. If some are excommunicated from the church, it means that they were in the church. Therefore, what is covered here has nothing to do with salvation and perdition (1 Cor. 5:5), because the excommunicated ones are saved ones.</P><P>The meaning here is this: When the church excommunicates a believer and such an act is carried out according to God's word, God will acknowledge in heaven what the church does on earth. John 20:23 is even clearer. Verse 23 immediately follows verse 22. Without the power of the Holy Spirit, there cannot be a proper excommunication. The authority of excommunication comes from the power of the Holy Spirit. These two verses should be read in conjunction with 1 Corinthians 5:11, 13 and 6:9-10. All those who have been properly excommunicated by the church will not reign in the millennium, though they themselves will be saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ESTHER</H2><P>Question: Why does the book of Esther have no mention of the name of God? (Weigh)</P><P>Answer: This is, of course, the ground for the higher critics to criticize the book of Esther. But I will quote Dr. Gaebelein's word, "Although the name God is not here, God Himself is in this little book. We see Him expressed in many areas. We see Him expressed in His arrangement and His power in delivering and preserving His covenanted people. Although God's people were unfaithful, He looked upon them and cared for them. He destroyed the enemy's plot. It is true that they had not called on Him. But His unbounded matchless grace was manifested to them. Hence, although this book does not mention God's name, it shows God's government."</P><P>Professor Cassel said, "This book was written by one Jew to all the Jews scattered in all the provinces of Persia. It recorded how God's sovereignty delivered His people from inevitable woe through miraculous hands. This book has no other purpose except this one; it is not for recording other incidents. Of course, this book also describes to us the life in the Persian palace, which we cannot find recorded anywhere else."</P><P>Gaebelein also said, "This book points out the fact that after the Jews had left their homeland and outwardly had nothing more to do with God, God was still being gracious to them. This termination of outward relationship may be the reason for this book to avoid the name of God."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTISMS</H2><P>Question: I read Hebrews 6:2 concerning the teaching of baptisms and do not understand what it means. Please explain to me in detail. Do the different baptisms in this verse mean that in the ancient churches there was also a variety of rituals, as it is today with the variety of baptisms found in the various denominations? Or does it mean the baptism of water, fire, and the Holy Spirit? (Law)</P><P>Answer: In the ancient church, there was no other baptism except water baptism. The baptisms here do not refer to the baptism of water, fire, or the Holy Spirit. This is speaking of the various washing ceremonies in the Old Testament. The apostle is here exhorting the Hebrew believers to leave the word of the beginning of Christ and to go on to perfection. They were Hebrews and had much to do with the Old Testament. The baptisms here refer to the many washings in the temple. Even the laying on of hands here refers to the laying of hands on the head of the sacrifices in the Old Testament. In the New Testament age, there is only "one baptism" (Eph. 4:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BAPTIZER</H2><P>Question: I have never seen the actual way of baptism. I wonder if it is all right for both males and females to baptize. Or should it just be males? If only males can baptize and the one being baptized is female, it is inappropriate for them to be in the water together for the sake of the weaker ones. Please do not ignore my questions for their insignificance, and please instruct me concerning the same.</P><P>Answer: According to the example of the Bible, we do not see sisters baptizing others. I dare not say that the Bible forbids sisters to baptize others, but it is clear that the Bible has not charged them to do this. As far as it being inappropriate for the weaker ones, we cannot be that concerned. I know that in the villages, when the brothers and sisters meet together under one roof, some unbelievers even criticize them for such. But we cannot separate the men and the women into two meetings just because others criticize us. If believers would keep a clear line between male and female in their daily lives and would walk soberly and properly, the unbelievers would have nothing more to say. John once baptized a prostitute. One thing is sure: "To those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure" (Titus 1:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEARING THE CROSS</H2><P>Question: Matthew 27:32, Mark 15:21, and Luke 23:26 all say that Simon the Cyrenian took up the Lord's cross. Why does it say in John 19:17 that the Lord Jesus bore His own cross to a place? Did He ask this Simon to bear it for Him along the way?</P><P>Answer: If you put the four passages together, there will be no problem. If we combine the four Gospels together and read them together, we will see the historical order of events. "Therefore they took Jesus. And bearing the cross for Himself, He went out" (John). "And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name" (Matthew), "a certain passerby coming from the country" (Mark). "They laid hold of Simon...and they placed the cross upon him to carry it behind Jesus" (Luke), "to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha" (John). According to Luke, Simon the Cyrenian was bearing the cross together with the Lord Jesus; the Lord was walking in front of him, and he was walking behind the Lord. Hence, the order of events should be this: the Lord went out with the cross and met Simon, while the crowd forced him to bear the cross with the Lord all the way to Golgotha.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PETER</H2><P>Question: In Acts 2:14 Peter and the eleven stood up to proclaim the Lord's word. Why is it that there was only the testimony of Peter and not the testimony of other apostles? Was Peter the representative of the eleven? (Luk)</P><P>Answer: This should not be a problem here. According to the text, all eleven apostles stood up, but only Peter opened up his mouth. We cannot say that Peter was the representative of the other eleven. But in the Gospels, we often see Peter being the mouthpiece of the twelve apostles. This is, of course, due to his age and his rashness. When he stood up to speak on the day of Pentecost, however, it was not because of the urging of his flesh, but because of the stirring of the Holy Spirit. The keys of the kingdom of the heavens was entrusted to Peter (Matt. 16:19). Hence, he was the first one to open the door of the gospel for the Jews (at Pentecost) and for the Gentiles (in the house of Cornelius).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD BAPTIZING</H2><P>Question: According to John 3:22, did the Lord Jesus baptize anyone while He was on earth? If so, in whose name were they baptized? (Luk)</P><P>Answer: No. John 4:2 says, "Although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but rather His disciples." According to the Bible, probably at that time it was not in anyone's name. This is not crucial. It is better that our thoughts be centered on the things that have to do with Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FORBIDDING OTHERS TO PUBLICIZE</H2><P>Question: Every time the Lord Jesus healed someone, He warned them not to tell others about the act. Why did He do this? Is it because He was afraid that too many would follow Him? (Luk)</P><P>Answer: It is because He did not want others to follow Him out of curiosity. He wanted those who followed Him to be the ones who had grace working in them in a deep way already. If they came merely because they had seen the miracles, such following may have even frustrated His proper works. The Lord Jesus was here to do a solid work, not works that were measured only by their quantity. What a lesson for us!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXERCISING THE GIFTS</H2><P>Question: How can a congregation identify those who have been gifted to oversee it? According to Acts 13:1-3, is the laying on of hands, and an open declaration of such, something condemned by the Lord? What is the limit of authority of those who oversee the church? If they do not have any authority at all, how can they settle disputes in the church? It is true that the authority of the church rests with the whole congregation, but does this mean that everyone should exercise his own authority and should not be bound by anything? Or should a few be elected to execute orders so that things can be accomplished? (Kuo)</P><P>Answer: The church is the Body of Christ. We can only understand the gifts through the function of the Body. The Bible always puts gifts and the Body together (Rom. 12, 1 Cor. 12). I have said elsewhere that the laying on of hands in the Bible is not a kind of acknowledgement of gift. We have to differentiate between gift and office. A gift is for the perfecting of the whole Body, whereas an office is for the administration of a church. Gifts are for the whole Body of Christ, whereas an office is for one individual church. In the Bible we see such a thing as men being ordained to oversee a church, but we never see anyone ordained to preach the word. Preaching is a gift, whereas administration is an office.</P><P>In those meetings that are in His name, a young man can exercise his gift to teach the congregated believers even though some in the congregation may be a few times older than he is. But his age prohibits him from being an elder to settle others' disputes. The present systems in the various denominations do not differentiate between the two. This is due to error and ignorance. Those who oversee do not necessarily preach: "Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching" (1 Tim. 5:17). This verse tells us that some elders only oversee the church, but do not preach or teach. The office of an elder is for the administration of the church. However, some of them also receive additional gifts of preaching and teaching from the Lord. An elder who preaches or teaches in the church does not do so because he was ordained and was thus qualified to do the same. A young man who does not occupy any office is as qualified to preach and teach as an elder who occupies an office.</P><P>In summary, the gifts mentioned in the Bible (including preaching, teaching, and shepherding) can be exercised by all the believers. Those who have these gifts are qualified to exercise these gifts. The office of overseeing the church is the responsibility of the elders (together with other serving deacons). The Bible does not acknowledge the gifts by the way of the laying on of hands, but as to the office, there is the laying on of hands. As to the question of the elders and their relationship to the laying on of hands, we have covered this matter elsewhere and will not repeat it here.</P><P>The laying on of hands in Acts 13 is a matter of identification. Otherwise, you would have the impossible case of a prophet ordaining an apostle.</P><P>The extent of authority of the overseeing one is a spiritual matter, and not fleshly. One should administer the church by prayer, godliness, and love. The Bible does not permit any form of imposition (1 Pet. 5:1-3).</P><P>The Bible does not have such a thing as the election of overseers. Those whom God has raised up should make themselves approved by their faith, love, and example; the believers will spontaneously recognize them as God's chosen ones. The church is a Body, not an organization. Hence, we cannot have everyone to be free to exercise his right. If the church were a social club, we could do this, but it is not a social club. Because there are so many unregenerated ones mixed in the church, problems occur when we practice according to the Bible. Either this is the case, or the majority of the believers are fleshly and have never been taught of the Bible. Those believers who are mature in the Lord are responsible for rebuking such things when they happen. This is true liberty. But this is at the same time more bondage than before. There is nothing more binding than the bonds in the Body. If everyone wants to have absolute freedom, we will end up with lawlessness, which is the spirit of Antichrist. In short, authority is spiritual, not something that the flesh can approve.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SCRIPTURAL ORGANIZATION</H2><P>Question: What is the scriptural way to meet, to serve God, and to oversee and shepherd the church of God? How should we be acquainted with each other socially? How should we collect the offerings, and how should we distribute the offerings? How should we assign people to preach, and what is the way to take care of the different branch mission halls? How should we have "all things...done becomingly and in order"? Please explain to me in detail, for I want to find a church organization and practice that is absolutely according to the Bible. (Kuo)</P><P>Answer: I am so happy to read the last few lines of your letter. There are not very many people in these days who are seeking. Many people are not willing to pay the price. Many have their own opinions, and many do not have a willingness to obey, so the church of God becomes what it is today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How to Meet</H2><P>The meetings of the believers are at times for prayer, at times for preaching, at times for the discussion of affairs, and at times for the breaking of bread to remember the Lord. For now we will only talk about the meetings for the breaking of bread and the worship of the Lord. A meeting should be gathered into the Lord's name (Matt. 18:20). This means that we should have the Lord as the center, and we should come for Him and worship Him. In the meetings, we should pay special attention that we are coming to the Lord Himself. We do not come merely because a certain person is there. We do not come to listen to certain preachers, nor for thousands of other reasons; we come only to meet the Lord. In the meetings, there is no set schedule and no man-made chairmen. Everything should be done under the leading of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:11). First Corinthians 14:26 is most crucial: "Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation." This verse tells us that all believers, whether old or young, rich or poor, have the right to be led by the Holy Spirit to share in the meeting. Verse 31 is even more clear: "For you can all prophesy one by one." When the Corinthians met together, there was much conduct that was disorderly. But the apostle did not consider such a way of meeting impermissible or that it should be changed. He merely told them that they should behave in an orderly way. However, this order is not a man-made, dead schedule that is manipulated by man. Rather, it is something according to the leading of the Holy Spirit and according to His orderly distribution. If we read this chapter alone, we find that in the meeting of God's children there are no formalities such as those found in present-day so-called services. "The first should be silent" in verse 30 is one example of the lack of formality. Verse 35 shows that if the brothers do not understand something in the meeting, they can ask at any time. Women should not speak in meetings with brothers present (11:5; 14:34). According to the Bible, the breaking of bread for the remembrance of the Lord should be a breaking of bread by the disciples (Acts 20:7, etc.). Hence, no one can represent the Lord to pass out the bread. There should be thanksgivings (1 Cor. 14:16), but no one is assigned to offer such thanksgivings. Everyone should be led by the Holy Spirit, and everyone should break the bread himself, with one merely taking the lead as the first one to break the bread.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How to Administrate<br>and Shepherd the Church of God</H2><P>In every meeting, the Lord raises up those who will work for Him. They do not have the so-called "official" commissions from the denominations, but they have God's commissioning. The Bible teaches that believers should subject themselves to such people. Their work is based on their relationship with the other members and their gifts, not on any human assignment or titles. Those brothers who have sinned should be admonished, warned, and eventually excommunicated. If they are to be excommunicated, they must have committed the sins in 1 Corinthians 5:11. All God's children who desire fellowship should be received, no matter what level of knowledge they may have (Rom. 14:1; 15:7). The anointing and praying for the sick (James 5:14-15) and other similar works should be done for the sake of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How to Have Social Acquaintances</H2><P>Other than the mutual fellowship among the believers, the Bible does not say anything about the church's social contacts with the government, society, or any other communities. Such are considered the acts of an adulterous woman.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How to Collect Offerings and Distribute Funds</H2><P>Concerning the offerings by the saints (of course, only offerings by the saints are acceptable), the Bible has clear instructions. There is neither the teaching nor the example in the Bible of the offering plate or the offering pouch being passed around for soliciting offerings on Sunday. Even in the Old Testament, we do not see such a practice! In the Old Testament, we see only a box set up at the entrance to the temple. A worker can exhort the believers to give (2 Cor. 8:7). But there is no such thing as sending men out to remind people or even beg for money. On the contrary, what we see is "with much entreaty they besought of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints" (v. 4). The teaching in 1 Corinthians 16:1-2 points out to us the importance of offering on the Lord's Day. Such offerings are for "filling up the lack of the saints" (2 Cor. 9:12). In distributing the offerings, we must, of course, consider what the offerings are designated for. But the attitude of 2 Corinthians 8:12 is most necessary. These offerings are, of course, put into the hands of those who are approved (1 Cor. 16:3) and "selected" (2 Cor. 8:19). Those who work for the Lord should be "taking nothing from the Gentiles" (3 John 7), and God's children should fill up their lack (2 Cor. 11:9; 1 Cor. 9:11; Phil. 4:15-16; 1 Tim. 5:17-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>How to Send Men to Preach<br>and How to Care for the Branch Mission Halls</H2><P>No matter how spiritual a person is, the Bible has not authorized anyone to send others out for the preaching work. Such practice is a poison left from the Roman Catholic Church. There is no such thing in the Bible as putting one servant of the Lord into the hand of another servant. All the servants are directly responsible to the Lord. Even Paul could not force Barnabas to not take Mark along. Brothers can make suggestions, but there must not be any control. Even the aged Paul only "exhorted" Timothy, his own son, to remain in Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:3). We observe in the work of the apostles that there were friendly exhortations that had to do with the work, but no such thing as the present assignment of preachers. You may ask: if this is the case, will not men move arbitrarily and become lazy in their work? Yes, they will, and that is wherein lies the failure of the denominational systems. This is bound to happen among hired workers. If we stop the practice of having salaried preachers, those denominations which have money (which was unheard of at the apostolic times) will no longer be able to control the servants of the Lord with their money, and they will only be able to hire shepherds who do not have any calling and who will take spiritual work as a kind of profession. If such is the case, will not many preachers be disqualified from their work? Yes, if we indeed practice this, we will see how numerous are those who joined the rank of preachers at will, and how few are those who are truly called by God! We should not volunteer to work ourselves; we should be those who are sent by God.</P><P>Terms such as "branch mission halls" and "branch churches" are not found in the Bible. All the churches in the Bible are administered locally by themselves. The practice of combining the different "churches" in the localities to form a head church is an invention of the denominational organizations. Things such as conventions, synods, head churches, districts, and precincts are all products of the human mind. The churches in the Bible are related to one another as members. They can encourage, teach, and warn one another, but no one church controls the affairs of another church. It is the practice of Roman Catholicism to try to unify church administration through joining different "churches" together. The Bible never considers the churches in Philippi and Ephesus to be under the church in Jerusalem. The basic unit of the Body of Christ is the individual believers, not the individual churches. The individual churches are not the members of the Body. We can lead others to Christ and teach others the way of the Lord, but we cannot have any human organization. If the Lord's precious blood is not enough to join us together, in the same way that the names of organizations are joining men together, does this not mean that the precious blood has become worthless to us? The brothers and sisters in the Lord should continually help one another, but the denominational, organizational, and institutional practices must be stopped. In short, if we want to follow the Bible, we need to trust in the power of the Holy Spirit. Otherwise, everything will be in confusion.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(10)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHO THE ROBBERS ARE</H2><P>Question: In John 10 the Lord says, "All who came before Me are thieves and robbers." Who are the thieves and the robbers? (Du)</P><P>Answer: The Lord Jesus is not referring to the prophets of old. This word refers to the scribes who had been controlling the Judaistic thought for four hundred years, since the cessation of the prophets who prophesied through inspiration concerning Christ. These scribes were not sent from God, but were teaching by themselves. The prophets came before the scribes, whereas the scribes came before Christ. The Lord is not condemning the prophets. He is referring to the scribes as the thieves and the robbers, because they stole and robbed the flock of God to cause them to listen to themselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTISM AFTER REGENERATION</H2><P>Question: If a believer has been sprinkled and is now regenerated in his spirit, is it all right if he does not go through an immersion again? (Wang)</P><P>Answer: This question should not be asked this way. You should not have asked if anyone who has been sprinkled and who has since been regenerated ought to be baptized by immersion. The biblical baptism is one in which a person is immersed into water. Sprinkling is not considered a baptism by the Bible. Hence, all those who have been sprinkled have not yet been baptized according to the Bible. Your question should be, "Should a regenerated person who has not been baptized be baptized?" If you ask this way, even you yourself will know what to answer. According to your question, a man can be baptized even before he is regenerated; this is not found in the Bible. The only baptism that counts as biblical is the baptism performed after regeneration. If a man is not regenerated, he is not yet a believer. The biblical baptism is only for the believers. You can pick out any verse in the New Testament on baptism and find this to be the case. Even if sprinkling could be considered a kind of baptism, an unregenerated person should not receive such a kind of sprinkling. The Bible likens baptism to burial (Rom. 6:4). When those who once lived in sin are baptized, they are being buried. Baptism is for the regenerated ones. Hence, a regenerated person must be baptized according to the Bible. Even the Lord Jesus had to fulfill this righteousness. How much more should we do the same? After the house of Cornelius was baptized in the Holy Spirit, they still had to be baptized in water. Why should a regenerated person not receive the scriptural baptism?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTISM AND HEALING</H2><P>Question: Does the water in John 5:6-8 refer only to the water of baptism? (Tsai, Tai-Chan)</P><P>Answer: Not only is this not referring only to the water of baptism; it has in fact nothing to do with the water of baptism at all. There is not the slightest hint to show us that this is the water of baptism. Recently, some have thought that the baptismal water could heal people. Perhaps they base their belief on this passage. This is absolutely a kind of demonic teaching. We warn God's children to stay away from this kind of teaching. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that the water of baptism can heal people. There is no such record, there is no such teaching, and there is not such an example, not at all. Is it not too unreliable to base a teaching on healing on one misinterpreted verse alone?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHURCH AND THE LAW</H2><P>Question: Do the words in Matthew 5:17-19 on fulfilling the law and practicing the law refer only to the Jews? Do they have anything to do with the church? Please instruct me. (Tsai, Chekiang)</P><P>Answer: Matthew 5:17 is speaking of the Lord Jesus, not about the world. No one in the world can fulfill the law and the prophets. Those who try to do this are either ignorant of themselves or trying to supersede the Lord's work. This fulfilling refers to the redemptive death of the Lord Jesus. Hence, if a man says, "If the Lord Jesus had to fulfill the law, does not a Christian have to do the same?" he is saying that since the Lord Jesus had to redeem man from sin, the believers should also redeem man from sin! The law in verse 19 refers to the teaching on the Mount. This is not for the Jews. Please read verses 1 and 2. Because of the "crowds," the Lord went up to the mountain. He only opened His mouth to teach the disciples. The disciples are the Christians (Acts 11:26). Hence, the teaching on the Mount, which is the law in verse 19, is for the Christians.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SOCIETY</H2><P>Question: Can a Christian join any social organizations? (Wang)</P><P>Answer: The Bible only recognizes one organization as legitimate for Christians to join and which Christians ought to join; it is the church. Other than the church, the Bible does not consider that believers should join any other organizations. Social organizations are not found in the Bible, and even "evangelistic societies," "prayer societies," and "missions" are not found in the Bible. If this is not reason enough for believers not to join any social organizations, we can look at the question from another angle. The Bible commands that we do not become "dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers" (2 Cor. 6:14). According to the teaching of the Bible, believers should not participate in any organization or group that has unbelievers in it. Believers should not be in an organization that has unbelievers in it, and they should not strive for prosperity together within such a group. Separation is the most important teaching.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTISM AND THE SUPPER</H2><P>Question: Is it reasonable for enlightened preachers to partake of the holy communion together with church members who have been baptized but who do not understand the real meaning of the Savior's baptism, with the hope of gradually uplifting the latter's standard? If the former do not do this, they will have to separate themselves, and there may be some inconvenience for them. Please instruct me. (Wang)</P><P>Answer: The question is whether or not they are all saved. If they are all saved, they can partake of the supper together, whether or not some understand the real meaning of baptism. But if some are not saved, it is unscriptural to partake of the Lord's supper together, no matter how much knowledge these unsaved ones have. The Bible never allows sinners to participate in the Lord's table.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>POLITICS AND RELIGION</H2><P>Question: Should one join the anti-Christian movement? Is it right that politics and religion should be separate?</P><P>Answer: Of course, one cannot join such a movement. How can we who believe in Christ join the anti-Christian movement? We should oppose imperialism and any such lawless things. But we should not participate in the anti-Christian movement.</P><P>Separation of politics and religion is a fine teaching in the Bible. "You know that those who are esteemed as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it is not so among you [the Christians]" (Mark 10:42-43). The Lord Jesus declared that His kingdom is not of this world. Hence, the church, which is subject to the Lord, does not need to go to war. But the question now is much deeper than that of separation between politics and religion.</P><P>Many believers think that it is good for politics and religion to be separated one from the other, that the church should not bother itself with politics, and that politics should not interfere with the church. But they think that the church should declare its stand and express its view concerning current issues and that believers can join political movements and serve as government officials. What they say seems to be reasonable, because they say that since believers are also citizens of a country, they have their works as citizens. We should look at the teaching in the Bible. The Lord Jesus left us "a model so that you may follow in His steps" (1 Pet. 2:21). The Lord is our example in everything. We will not go wrong if we follow Him in respect to our relationship to politics. Was the Lord Jesus a politician? Did He pay attention to the politics of His country? Did He ever represent the voice of the people to criticize the officers of Palestine? Did He ever rebuke the political oppressors on behalf of the politically oppressed? Did He ever rally any political power around Him? Please read Luke 12:14; 13:1-3; Matthew 17:24; 22:21.</P><P>Christians are merely strangers and sojourners on earth (Heb. 11:13-16; 1 Pet. 2:11). Who can interfere or participate in the politics of a country? Only those who are the citizens of that country can do this. Those Chinese who reside in Japan have no right to interfere with the politics of Japan. The fact that we are strangers and sojourners shows that we have nothing to do with the politics of this world.</P><P>Some have said, "Who can be more qualified to be government officers? Are they not more just and morally qualified than others?" The answer in the Bible is that Christians are the most unqualified to be government officers. A government officer is one who executes the law. The laws in the world are based on justice, and all transgressors have to be punished. However, the principle of conduct of Christians today is mercy (Matt. 5:38-48). Can world politics act according to the teaching on the Mount? The words "do not judge, that you be not judged" (Matt. 7:1) have forever disqualified believers from interfering with politics or being executors of law.</P><P>The Lord Jesus forever separated politics from the church of God in Matthew 22:21. Since believers do not belong to Caesar (who represents politics), they should never do the work of Caesar. Let those who belong to Caesar do the work of Caesar. We who belong to God should be separated solely unto God.</P><P>The Bible only commands believers to be obedient citizens of a country and obey the officers; it has not commanded the believers to be officers themselves and be obeyed. Please read Titus 3:1; Romans 13:1, 5-7. If we are pressured to act contrary to God's commands, we have to act according to Acts 5:29. Matthew 10:23 is also a good solution. We can choose to disobey, but we must never become non-submissive or rebel.</P><P>If God's children try to be officers at the gate of Sodom, they will find that before Lot had a chance to convert Sodom, Sodom had converted Lot!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALUTATION</H2><P>Question: Can a Christian salute pictures of men? (Wang)</P><P>Answer: Each individual can only receive the answer to this question from the Lord Himself. In the Ten Commandments, the first one forbids having other gods. This has to do with God. The next commandment has to do with images. Here we see that not only must we "not make unto thee any graven image," but we must not make "any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth." Man received the commandment to "not bow down [better translated as `not saluting'] thyself to them," whatever one's motive may be, "nor serve them" as though they are God (Exo. 20:4-5).</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWELVE BASKETS FULL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HUMILITY</H2><P>The heavier a load that a boat carries, the lower it will sink, and the bigger the fruit that grows on a tree, the lower the branches will bend. The bigger a tree becomes, the deeper the roots will go. This is also true with those who have received more grace from God. Those who have not received very much grace are boastful; however, a humble person has always received more grace from God. Only God can cause a person to be humble. Humility is not thinking less about oneself; it is thinking nothing about oneself. Humility is not lightly esteeming oneself, but not considering oneself at all. A truly humble person is truly dead to himself. If the self has not died, a person may not act unbecomingly in an outward way, but he invariably steals glory for himself inwardly! Man's heart is more evil than anything! It is one thing to be humble and another thing to be withdrawn. The two should not be confused one with each other. Humility that results from self-strength or a natural disposition (some people are very humble by nature) will only lead to withdrawal, and the end is abandonment. True humility before the Lord does not withdraw at a crisis or pull back from advancement in the name of false meekness. In all things pertaining to God, it strives forward on the one hand, and acknowledges one's uselessness and powerlessness on the other hand. At the same time, it trusts in God moment by moment and "in all thy ways acknowledge[s] him" (Prov. 3:6). Those who are afraid of being put on the spot are not humble, but spiritually sick. How difficult it is to serve the Lord in humility and, at the same time, take up one's responsibility. However, the words "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" are trustworthy. Let us look to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OBEDIENCE</H2><P>How sweet it is to obey the Lord! What a joy it is to suffer the loss of many things for the sake of obeying the Lord! Those who have never walked the way of obedience will not agree with this word. But no one who has walked the way of obedience is completely ignorant of this word. Those who take the way of obedience in a daily way consider loss as gain and shame as glory. There is a reward for obedience; the reward is the power to deny the self and obey the Lord when obedience is called for the next time. There is also a punishment for disobedience; the punishment is more self-will, more submission to the self, and more rebellion against the Lord when obedience is called for the next time. This is the reward and punishment in this age. The more we obey, the more the Lord is manifested. The more we suffer through obedience, the more our joy increases. If we knew this, we would honor the Lord very much! But there are degrees to our obedience! How difficult is absolute obedience for us! But, at the same time, how sweet it is! We can obey the Lord in everything only by dying to the self. When our self-will dies, the Lord's will is done. There is no better expression before the Lord than dying to our self-will. Unfortunately, man's heart is wicked, and our hearts are no better! Many of us spend all our time dwelling on our obedience in the past. We consider how much we loved the Lord and how pliable we were. But there are many areas where we have not yet obeyed! May we receive much grace from the Lord to consider our disobedience and our delay in obeying! If we do this, we will grow more in grace. Is our heart wicked? Yes. We fill our hearts with our past obedience, and we makes excuses for the areas where we have not obeyed or will not obey with words like: "Why the inflexibility?" "Don't be too extreme." "Can we not do it another way?" May the Lord shine His light on us so that we would realize that, behind these words, there are matters in which we will not obey or have not obeyed! Strangely, we consider the areas where we have obeyed to be unchangeable and the areas where we have not obeyed to be somewhat flexible! If we knew God's heart, would we act this way? It is difficult to bear the cross if we have not sat down and counted the cost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RIGHTEOUS CHRISTIAN</H2><P>Before we trusted in the Lord Jesus, we lived in sin and transgressions. We did not know anything about righteousness. After regeneration we gradually become aware of God's standard of holiness and goodness. Young believers often fall into danger because of the new knowledge they have acquired through regeneration. What do I mean? What is the danger? It is the danger of requiring too much righteousness from others! What does this mean? Based on the new light young believers have received, they make clear distinctions between right and wrong, and they measure others according to the spiritual standard that they know. When they see Christians whose acts do not match their words, they become very angry. If others fail slightly, they are ready to immediately condemn them with words like: "Why would he do this?" "Why would such a person do such a thing?" Every believer who tries to "exercise fairness" has not experienced the deep work of God's grace. If he advances in God's way, and if his spirit is perfected by the Spirit of God, he would be more forgiving. The Lord Jesus made a definite judgment concerning this type of behavior in His teaching on the mount. Believers should not demand that others be righteous. The Lord has not charged us to clamor for justice when we are beaten, coerced, or ill-treated. His command and teaching is to endure and give to others what they do not deserve. We should not demand that others be righteous, nor should we act merely on the basis of righteousness toward others. (We should not recompense others only according to what they deserve, even if they do deserve such recompense.) We should be perfect, as the Father who is in heaven is perfect, who sends rain to the righteous as well as to the unrighteous. As God's children, we should pay more attention to this matter, or we will be judged for being unmerciful to others with our words all the time. We should be very righteous towards ourselves, but very forgiving towards others. We must never be careless and fail to give others what is rightfully theirs; this is righteousness. But we should never demand that they do their duty; this is forgiveness. A Christian ought to be righteous but should not demand righteousness from others. If we do not practice this, our loss will be great! Moreover, this is the way that the Lord will gain those who will reign with Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW CHRISTIAN LIFE IS MANIFESTED</H2><P>Man's life does not consist of only a few major events. His life is expressed in many small things in his daily life. In order to know the spiritual condition of a man, we should not consider just his exposition of the Bible on the platform, nor his conduct among others in the believers' congregation. We should not look at his public life, but at his daily life, his smile, look, words, walk, and contact with others. At the beginning of the Christian life, a believer has many "performances." Much of his so-called love, faith, and endurance is a forced performance. He acquires these spiritual virtues through outward means; they do not issue from God's inward work. He can mask himself before men. But when he is by himself, the true self is exposed! In this condition, there is often a lack of true hatred towards sin. What do I mean? All we have to do is to consider his motives. When his shortcomings are slightly exposed, he becomes very depressed and very sorrowful. But if no one knows of his failure, his sorrow is greatly diminished! When a believer falls into this condition, the best thing that he can do is to forget about his "face" and go to God to confess his evil and wickedness. He should apply the accomplished work of the cross through the Holy Spirit and put to death his self, so that God's life can be fully lived out of Him. He should daily cooperate with the Holy Spirit and learn to acknowledge Him in all his ways (Prov. 3:6). If a man says that he lives in Christ, yet does not express His life in many small things, he should go before the Lord and ask Him to show him his real condition.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWELVE BASKETS FULL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>FRAGMENTS OF GEMS</H2><P>Sin yields sorrow; salvation yields peace and joy.</P><P>If you love the Lord Jesus, you should tell Him.</P><P>God says He will bless us when we obey Him.</P><P>To have fellowship with the Lord Jesus is far more important than to work for Him.</P><P>May every morning become your life's new beginning.</P><P>The Bible was given to us as a teacher for this present age.

When we consider ourselves to be strong, we rely on our own strength, resulting in spiritual weakness. When we know how useless we are and thus rely on His strength, we are strong.</P><P>Difficulties provide the atmosphere for miracles and are the initial step to miracles. If there is to be a great miracle, what is encountered must not only be something hard, but something absolutely impossible to overcome. Whether the Lord has spoken or not, we can fully trust in a Savior who is without worry or fear.</P><P>If God leads you to walk a way that you know, it will not benefit you as much as if He would lead you to take the way that you do not know. This forces you to have hundreds and thousands of conversations with Him, resulting in a journey that is an everlasting memorial between you and Him.</P><P>Your Leader will lead you to walk an untrodden way, to go down a path you never dreamed of. He is afraid of nothing, and He wishes you to be afraid of nothing also. He is with you. In desperate situations it is His joy to see His children grasping His hands.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SATISFIED WITH HIM</H2><P>Contentment is a virtue of the saint. The first step toward it is to offer up everything to God. Taking God as all gives one a heart of contentment.</P><P>Saints who entangle themselves with the world cannot help but crave for vainglory. Vainglory, like all other kinds of glories in the world, cannot satisfy man's heart. No matter how much fame a believer may gain, he will never be satisfied.</P><P>Blessed is he who knows that the Lord Jesus is our all! If we have never ascended with the Lord to see all the vanities under the sun, it will be hard for us not to set our mind on things of this earth. If we have not been enlightened by the Holy Spirit to see that what we have is forever and is real, we too will be greedy. Praise God, He is the treasure to those who believe in Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HIDDEN OR PROMINENT</H2><P>Saints of God, do not covet fame. We should be hidden in God. Those pursuing a great name are most likely wounded by Satan. Those who are hidden in the Lord's hand, how secure and peaceful they are!</P><P>It is abnormal for a saint to seek worldly glories. Those who love the Lord do not wish to be great in this world. Among the saints in the church of God, however, many still crave for a high position and to be called Rabbi. The crisis with the saints is not in the world but in the church!</P><P>How wise is the Lord! He told us to call each other only brother and to use no other title. It is regrettable that many, even among the brothers, want to be a great brother! If we have not allowed the Holy Spirit to work the Spirit of the cross in us, we cannot avoid a wicked heart to pursue a name.</P><P>Many consider that the world is in the world, without realizing that the world is also in the church and in the hearts of the saints! Unless one is truly dead to the world, it is hard to rid oneself of this kind of heart. Only those saints who have truly died with the Lord on the cross can be dead to the world in the church and in their hearts.</P><P>To not go after vainglory is a matter of the heart. If the Lord wants to put us in a prominent position, we should be willing and not shrink from it. Regrettably, the fame we secure comes from our own seeking. In our heart we covet a great name. If we are willing to rest in God's hand, seeking only His pleasure, not caring for other people's envying or rejecting, and considering wherever He puts us as the best position for us, we are in the position the Lord wants us to be.</P><P>To be hidden is not to be withdrawn. To be really hidden is not to be hidden with the hope of getting a name. To be hidden is not to hide somewhere physically but to have our inward being rest in God's bosom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HEART OR POLICY</H2><P>This present age is a commercial age. Whatever we deal with is a matter of politics. How pitiful that even believers are influenced by this! We should know the difference between sincerity and politics. There is a heaven-to-earth difference between loving people with a sincere heart and loving people politically.</P><P>To love others with a sincere heart is to have a love that issues from the heart. To love politically is to have a love from the mind. To love in sincerity is an expression of genuineness. To love politically is an outward act with much reluctance. Sincere love is very spontaneous, in which the inward agrees with the outward. Political love is performed, and the inward does not correspond to what is outward.</P><P>The acts of fleshly Christians are for the most part politically motivated. Their conduct is not spontaneous, and there is no spontaneous outflow of their real feeling. Rather, they act because they are afraid of people's criticism or are desirous of others' praise. Take the case of brotherly love. Their expression in loving the brothers comes not from their real love, but through fear that others would criticize their spirituality if they do not do this. Alas! The love of many is heartless and false. May the Lord save us from this.</P><P>Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 13 really penetrate our mind and thought. Even an act as great as giving our body to be burned can be done without love! This kind of love is not of a sincere heart, but is political. This is why the apostle said, "I profit nothing" (v. 3).</P><P>Political love is outward, in which the mouth and the heart do not agree. There is merely an outward shell. Within the shell, there is no gracious work of God. This self-deceit and deceiving of others is but the plot of Satan.</P><P>At any rate, this kind of love is the playing of politics. Playing of politics cannot last long. After a while the true inward condition will be exposed! This kind of performance and reluctant love will not be any help whatsoever to us spiritually.</P><P>Brothers, we should rely on the Lord's cross and do away with all malice that we may have in our hearts, "Love one another from a pure heart fervently" (1 Pet. 1:22; 4:8). "Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue but in deed and truthfulness" (1 John 3:18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>KNOWLEDGE AND JUDGMENT</H2><P>The Bible forbids judging others (Matt. 7:1). Under no circumstances should the saints of God criticize others. Today too many Christians act as judges of their brothers! I often hear this saying, "Christians are the best critics." This is a common sickness among believers. We should ask the Lord to set a watch before our mouths and keep the door of our lips.</P><P>Judging others is related to what we know. We are more apt to judge when we do not know the full picture. We are also apt to criticize when we are too clear in our reasonings.</P><P>It is thoughtless for one to judge presumptuously according to hearsay without first knowing the real situation! Others have their secrets; how could we know them all? How unfair it is for us to criticize others presumptuously without first knowing everything! We should not dare to judge others, because we do not have full factual knowledge concerning them. Although at times we think we have all the facts, it is possible that there may still be misunderstandings. We should remember how bad we feel and how our heart suffers when we are mistakenly judged by others! The others may think that all the facts are true as well! In like manner, when we criticize others, we may think that we know all the facts, without realizing that there are still hidden factors, like the case of our judging others. We feel bad when we are judged. Why then should we make others feel bad?</P><P>What a pity that many times biblical knowledge only helps people to criticize others! The more knowledge a person has in his head, the more critical he becomes. What benefit will this knowledge be to him? Knowledge that comes from books or that is collected from mental exercise usually forms our basis for judging others! The clearer a person is concerning biblical truths, the more he knows how to criticize others in a mean way.</P><P>At any rate, God has not ordained such a one to be the judge. Those who criticize others will in turn be criticized before Christ's judgment seat. God does not take pleasure in those who only know how to speak about others' shortcomings, but who never check concerning themselves. We should never seek the will of God for others. God knows how to lead everyone. God can lead you; He can also lead others. Do not think that, just because you consider that something is not the will of God, it is therefore not the will of God, and that you can therefore proceed to judge your brothers. God is responsible for their actions and deeds. We need not be concerned for them.</P><P>Many times God has forgiven a person, yet we still judge such a one. It seems as if man is more righteous than God! May we not fall to such a degree! If God could forbear our brother's mistake, why can we not bear the same? We should not expose the sin that God has covered. To continue in judgment is of no benefit to others, and it is harmful to ourselves. Those who do so forget how God has been merciful to them.</P><P>Children of God, at difficult times such as now, what is lacking is not your harsh judgments, but your tender love. Do not increase others' tears and suffering through your knowledge. May we bind up the wounds of all our neighbors with the wine of joy and the oil of the Holy Spirit (Luke 10:34). May we comfort others and not criticize them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUIETNESS</H2><P>In my observation, I see a shortcoming among the saints today, which is their talkativeness and their not aspiring to be quiet (1 Thes. 4:11). Many are not at all lively, whereas others are too lively! Those who have received more grace from God will surely bow their heads low. But those who have not been deeply rooted in Jesus Christ are bound to be frivolous in their behavior. Proverbs says, "A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself" (18:2). How true this is! Often those without the Lord's perfecting work like to make a show of their merits. But if we have been in the Lord and have been nurtured much by Him, we will agree with Jeremiah, "Let him sit alone and be silent,/Because He has laid it upon him" (Lam. 3:28).</P><P>A living of quietness is often one that gives off fragrance. If we speak less, our words will become more powerful. Much speaking is a sign of spiritual leakage. The Lord Jesus said of the Holy Spirit, "He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you....He will not speak from Himself" (John 16:14, 13). A person who is full of the Holy Spirit will have such a life. If something is not from the Lord, such a one will not speak to others about it. Every word he utters is not according to himself. We should not speak what we want to speak, but speak only after we have heard the Lord's word. If we obey the Holy Spirit in this point, our daily conversation will be cut by more than half! This is the only way to glorify our Lord. If the Spirit glorifies the Lord by what He says, how should those who claim to be full of the Holy Spirit behave?</P><P>How our natural being loves to express what we know! If those brothers and sisters ahead of us in the Lord have teachings that we only half understand, we are so apt to say, "I know this already. Indeed, this is what I have been doing all the time." When the Lord's servant preaches, how we love to show that we are different from others who know nothing about what is being preached. Little do we realize that we know less than others do. Our eagerness to express ourselves only proves our shallowness in knowledge. A life of quietness is a life that possesses real knowledge!</P><P>When facing a welcoming crowd, how difficult it is to be quiet! This does not mean merely to keep our mouth closed, but to be inwardly unmoved. The temptation then is to add some words, directly or indirectly, to broadcast our own merits. At such times it would be wonderful if we could remain unmoved by outward influences and would maintain a cool attitude!</P><P>When we are despised by others, it is hard for us to maintain our composure without murmuring behind the backs of others. It is even harder to be quiet before the Lord in addition to remaining silent before men. A person can do this only if his inner man is not stirred up.</P><P>A quiet life is one in which a person is quiet in his spirit and is not influenced by the outward world. It is not merely to speak little. There are those in the world who are born with few words. But there are none that are born "quiet." Those who speak few words have turmoil in their heart just as everyone else does; they may even have more turmoil than others do. Certainly those who are quiet are few in words. For a person to grit his teeth to refrain from speaking is not quietness, for the heart is still in turmoil.</P><P>Unless the cross works deeply in man's heart, no one can be quiet. Only when the Holy Spirit works in us the meaning of the cross, to the extent that the Spirit takes over our whole being, can there be the possibility of being quiet. Our Lord is indeed a good pattern for us. When the multitude forced Him to be king, He retreated to the wilderness (John 6:15). When He stood before Pontius Pilate, He would not utter a word (Matt. 27:12-14). His outward silence showed that He was not disturbed inwardly.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWELVE BASKETS FULL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A CERTAIN DAY</H2><P>How anxious I am today! Seemingly, I have lost something! I surely would like to leave this place to meet with some saints to soothe my loneliness. A day like this is hard to endure! To be here confined alone is really not easy!</P><P>This is an occasional activity of the soul. It is the provoking of the soul.</P><P>O Lord, I dare not move one step; for I know that Your Spirit works in my heart to divide my soul from my spirit, so that my spirit can ascend to heaven and so that I can be one spirit with the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, and not be affected by the provocation of my soul.</P><P>How unbearable, truly unbearable! If I can endure this unbearableness and not try to escape from the route that the Lord has chosen for me, the soul will lose its power of influence.</P><P>May the Lord cause me to be calm. (January 2)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEVER THIRST AGAIN</H2><P>When the Lord, who is worthy of our praises forever, was on the earth, He told us, "Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" (John 4:14). This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, for what the Lord bestowed upon us can satisfy us forever. The Lord knows the nature of His own gift.</P><P>But what a pity that many times in our experiences we are not like this! Many times we are thirsty again! Do we not have this sense of dryness often? We often feel dissatisfied and even feel the presence of much need.</P><P>However, the word of our beloved Lord will never return void. Whatever He says is true.</P><P>The problem is on our side, because we do not believe! If we believe His word, we will surely not thirst again. The living water He promised will constantly supply our parched soul and spirit, and it will satisfy all our desires. The more we believe the Lord's promise, the more the life will "flow."</P><P>Oh, how disgusting is this evil heart of unbelief! May the Lord give us grace that we may believe in Him and rest in Him.</P><P>Blessed are those who know that the Lord can satisfy our heart! Blessed are those who have no thirst other than the thirst for the Lord!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REST</H2><P>We have only one resting place and that is our Lord-"Rest in the Lord." If we rest in our environment, knowledge, perception, health, or spiritual experience, we will find that they will change and will fail. They are shaky foundations. Thank the Lord that He is our resting place. Although we cannot rest on anything else, we can rest in Him. He is our high tower with a firm foundation.</P><P>Because of His great love, we rest in Him. He loves us. This love is "eternal" and "unto the end." This love caused our Lord Jesus Christ to come down from heaven to die for us on the cross, to resurrect and ascend, to intercede for us, and to prepare a place for us, and it will cause Him to come again. How marvelous this love is! The human tongue and reasonings fail to depict this love of the Lord. Since we have such a loving God, why is it we cannot stop worrying and simply rest in Him? Nothing that comes along should make us anxious or worried. We should calm down and rest. Why? Because God loves us.</P><P>Furthermore, we rest in Him because of His wisdom. His wisdom will not let Him miscalculate. He knows how to arrange and how to proceed. Everything that comes to us has gone through His wise consideration. He knows how to cause all things to work together for good to those who love God. Although we may think that we are in despair and have no way to go on, and although our hearts are troubled, yet He is not like us. He knows how to uphold the whole universe, and He also knows how to arrange the smallest things for us. So why do we worry? Does He not have wisdom?</P><P>Moreover, we rest in Him because of His mighty power. His arm will never fail, and the greatness of His power is inconceivable. Whatever things He knows that He should do, He is able also to accomplish them. He is able to save His children. He is able to destroy Satan's work. He is forever victorious. It is this power that is working for us! Therefore, trembling and feeble brothers, we can be bold. Recline and rest in the Lord, because this mighty Lord is our Father.</P><P>May the Lord give us rest and free us from anxiety in times of difficulty through looking up to Him. May we believe His love, wisdom, and power, and may we not cause any useless confusion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SELF-EXALTATION</H2><P>To exalt oneself is to put one's self in an improper place. This is a danger to the young believers and a trap to the older saints. Only after the cross has done its thorough work in a person's heart can he refrain from expressing himself. Only then will a person allow others to receive the glory and remain silent himself as a sword in God's scabbard. The life of a Christian must not for a moment be separated from the cross. The Holy Spirit of God works through the cross to expose our fallen and corrupt nature. After such discipline from God, the saints will know by experience their own miserable state. Thereafter, they not only will avoid expressing themselves, but will consider it a shameful thing to do so, for God has shown them their true condition through their experience. The more a person knows his own condition, the less he will express himself. But the pity is that we do not know ourselves! We ought to see light in God's light. There are varying degrees of self-exaltation. Some blow the horn before men, whereas others may just have a little self-appreciation. Nevertheless, the eagerness of the self within is the same. Some self-exaltation comes from pride-esteeming oneself above others. Some self-exaltation comes from jealousy-elevating oneself to be equal with others. These are all works of the flesh. Even though some motives may be better than these, they are still liable to put a person in danger.</P><P>To worship the creature instead of giving glory to the Creator seems to be man's peculiar sin. If the Lord gives us honor and glory, it is already hard to avoid hero-worship from others; how much more if a person purposely exalts himself to attract people's attention? Besides its effects on others, his own spiritual desolation can definitely be foretold.</P><P>Although superficially such ones have a certain amount of success, in the spiritual battle they have already lost their ground. Oh, how numerous are the newsletters and reports today! May the Lord restrain me from judging people. Few of those reports direct people to give glory to God! Oh, amidst the words of praises to God, there are so many words of praises to men-even praises to themselves! Alas, many times our heart desires people to glorify God, and us as well!</P><P>In many works God is pushed to the back, and we wonder who is really the master. At any rate, there is no reason whatsoever to justify a person's praising himself.</P><P>Was I not the same when I was a babe in Christ? How happy I felt when I received praises and recognition from people!</P><P>May the Lord cause us to know ourselves and to learn to be a quiet and hidden person.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FLY IN THE OINTMENT</H2><P>The goal of the Lord Jesus Christ is that we be perfect. He wants to "sanctify her, cleansing her [His church] by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:26-27). This is the Lord's expectation and ordination.</P><P>But we have fallen far short of this!</P><P>Indeed, we are pursuing daily, but how far are we from this mark? The Lord Christ wants us to be perfect, and so does the world. If we are not perfect, we cannot please Christ, and neither can we attract the souls of the world. Of course, compared with the time when we were newly saved, we have made some progress, even significant progress. But, are there not many minor blemishes and spots in our disposition and behavior? "Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savor" (Eccl. 10:1). How numerous are the dead flies! Often we say of some, "He does love the Lord, but his temper is a little on the bad side. She is really zealous, but she is a bit proud." It is so easy to see dead flies in others' ointment!</P><P>Yet we should know that in our own daily living there are so many kinds of dead flies. May the Lord open our eyes to see them all! Sometimes we save people and render help to them, and our hearts are filled with the Lord's love. But after a while, when we are stirred up, we become anxious! Sometimes the Lord uses us to save some people and help them, but in the very next moment we turn around and give the glory to ourselves. Sometimes we are zealous to work, ready to suffer for the Lord, and even to die for Him. But when we return home and find that our loved ones do not appreciate our labor and do not care about our fatigue, we ignite the fire of hell again! Sometimes we make up our mind not to mention others' shortcomings, but we tell others, saying, "I tell you this so that you can pray for him." Sometimes through the teaching of the Lord we develop a love for all the brothers, but we still cannot avoid treating some coldly and thinking that we have to "separate ourselves from them"! Alas, there are countless numbers of dead flies in the daily walk of the saints!</P><P>Those who pursue holiness wholeheartedly will understand this.</P><P>Satan-Beelzebul, which means the king of flies-always puts flies in our daily living to cause failure amidst our success and to put in flaws that mar perfection. We should confess the sins of our failure before the Lord and ask Him to wash us always with the water of the word. But this is painful, and our flesh is not willing! We should resist Satan and recover the ground we lost to him, so that we would not be unconsciously contaminated by his filth.</P><P>Brothers, let us by the grace of the Lord get rid of the little foxes (S.S. 2:15), the little leaven (1 Cor. 5:6), and the little folly (Eccl. 10:1) so that we can be perfect as our Father is perfect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BELIEVERS' GIVING</H2><P>"Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews. For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place...and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" (Esth. 4:13-14). I am greatly reminded whenever I read these verses that at that time Esther's brothers, the Jews, were in an extremely dangerous situation. They were soon to be annihilated by their enemy. Besides Esther, probably no one else could have saved them. Here, Mordecai's warning to her was really God's advice to those who have the ability to help their brothers. To save the Jews is God's purpose. God has ordained that His people be saved. He could not bear to see His people suffer. God respected Esther and desired to use her as an instrument to help save the Jews. If Esther failed God, then God would have to select another vessel to save His people. Esther then would lose the glory of assisting God and the joy of helping her people. Because the Jews must get "enlargement and deliverance...from another place."</P><P>At present among God's children there are many in need. They have many needs not only in spiritual things but also in material things. Many servants and handmaids of the Lord are willing to give up everything to go out and preach for the sake of the Lord and to take nothing from the Gentiles (3 John 7). They are indeed poor materially. For the need of His children, God "will fill your every need" (Phil. 4:19), because He will not put to shame those who rely on Him. This is God's ordination and His purpose.</P><P>At present He is choosing the vessels for His work, the channels for the river to flow through.</P><P>God respects you and grants you the glory of assisting Him. We should realize that to give to God's children is not to our loss. To "give" is not to "lose," and to "donate" is not to "diminish." When you give alms, there is nothing to boast of. On the contrary, it is your glory that God would esteem you, honor you, and use you. May we not belittle such glory. "Then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place." If you fail the Lord by shirking from what He wants you to do, do you think that the Lord has no other way? Indeed, He still has "another place." Of necessity He will search for others, but you will lose your opportunity to show your allegiance to the King! You will be belittling God's esteem and disregarding God's good intention in honoring you! Thus, you will fail God, and God will be delayed in His purpose for man. However, with Him is the source of riches. Originally He intended to honor men by allowing them to participate in His miracles and in His work. If they all fail, will He not rain manna from heaven or dispatch ravens again? Nevertheless, He will always have His "another place." The pity, of course, will be that we will lose the joy and the glory of co-working with Him. All those who have intimate fellowship with the Lord know the value of co-working with God. Those who make the Lord's heart their heart know the misery of disappointing the Lord. If the Lord will use His word to divide our soul from our spirit and will give us the experience of ascension, we will know how to sympathize with Him and how to take His interest as our interest. In such a case, we will certainly not be so indifferent toward the work of God's other children on earth.</P><P>Finally we should remember, "Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?" The Lord allows you to have a surplus today in order that you may give today.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWELVE BASKETS FULL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>BUSY</H2><P>Busy is a common word.</P><P>All the burdens that the Lord gives to us are light and easy. He has not asked us to bear what we cannot bear. It is important to remember this, for this fact will afford us much comfort!</P><P>Some Christians carry with them the slogan: "I am too busy. I am really busy." They are laboring day and night, and there is not a moment of free time. It seems as if their burdens are indeed heavy. I am not just speaking of ordinary believers who labor in their jobs. I am also speaking of workers who labor directly in the Lord's work.</P><P>It is not the Lord's will for His children to be busy day and night and have no time to be in quietness and solitude, to commune, fellowship, and converse with God. Neither is it the Lord's will for His workers to be fishing day and night without having time to mend their nets.</P><P>Let me say an honest word. Many people are busy for nothing, and they are busy unnecessarily! Every child of God should pause to think: "Will my job really not get done if I am not that busy?" I am afraid that many bustlings are needless and unnecessary. Yet we are still confusingly busy. This is either caused by Satan's instigation or by the demand in our environment. How harsh are these two masters: Satan and our environment!</P><P>Satan's way is either to pull back or to push forward. If he cannot draw us back and keep us from going on, he will push us and cause us to go to the extreme. I am afraid that many of the bustlings are instigated by him.</P><P>Is there a minute that the demands in our environment will abate? Every hour and every minute, the demands stand waiting for us to work. How can we take that as our standard? I know that many times we can clearly get by without being so busy. Our being busy is a result of the agitation of the environment, and it is unnecessary.</P><P>The best guide to our work is God's will. Are all the things that have been keeping you busy all day long the things that God wants you to do? If they are not, why are you doing them?</P><P>What makes us busy is not the great and important things, but the small and miscellaneous matters. Are all these matters what the Lord wants us to do? If we examine all our works in this way, I am afraid a lot of items will be scratched off from our daily schedule!</P><P>Generally speaking, whenever works become numerous and we become busy, our hearts are confused, and we lose the inner peace. "But Martha was being drawn about with much serving" (Luke 10:40). The Lord wants us to maintain our quietness in Him. He does not want us to miss the top blessing.</P><P>We have to realize that it is not by much work that we receive the reward. We receive the reward by carrying out God's will faithfully. If something is not the will of God, what benefit is there for us to do it?</P><P>It is not because we want to forsake our duty, but because we want to please the Lord more and have more time to fellowship with Him that we do not allow ourselves to be distracted.</P><P>In summary, it is better to be busy in prayer than to be busy in work. A person can accomplish more by prayer than by being busy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONSECRATION AND DAILY AFFAIRS</H2><P>Every believer should do his individual preaching, but it is not mandatory that every believer be a full-time preacher. Those who work for the Lord, of course, labor daily in the Lord's work. However, an ordinary believer has to go to work to make his living and to provide for his family.</P><P>The person who genuinely works for the Lord realizes that what he does is God's work and that eventually he will gain his reward. This being the case, the more he works, the more he will be interested in his work, and the more he will love his work.</P><P>But the ordinary believers have a difficult task. What they are engaged in are occupations of the world, and they fully realize that such works are vain and will pass away. Nevertheless, for their stomach and their family, they have to do their duty. Therefore, there is not much enjoyment in their work.</P><P>The most difficult cases are those of the sisters in the Lord. Many sisters love the Lord and are willing to work for the Lord. They may be fervent with a burning heart, and they may want to work for the Lord. But they are wives and mothers; they already have a family. In the family they must do washing, shopping, feeding, and cooking. These things already occupy most of their time. They love to serve the Lord, but they are unable to do so. As a result, many become unhappy.</P><P>Furthermore, those who labor for the gospel often feel God's presence, because they do God's work. Those who take care of secular things, however, may hear the children's cry and the crowd's noise; or they may quietly sit in an office or be busy in the kitchen, but in all these environments it seems difficult for anyone to have God's presence.</P><P>Nevertheless, is not God the Father of us who believe in Him? How kind, tender, and caring is the word "Father"! Those who preach the gospel are His children, and those who take care of secular things are also His children. Just as He cares for those who preach the gospel, in the same way He cares for those who make a living in the world.</P><P>If we want to meet God and to have His presence in all our works, we should remember the word, "Whatever you do,...as to the Lord and not to men" (Col. 3:23). This is the gospel of the believers! We ought to praise God!</P><P>He not only accepts the work done for Him directly, but He also gladly accepts the work done by all His children for His sake. "Whatever you do"-any proper work without the mixture of sin-we all can do it as unto the Lord. Therefore, a mother who takes care of her children can count her work as done unto the Lord. A wife who takes care of the household can count what she does as unto the Lord. Laborer, office worker, servant, all can count what they do as unto the Lord. Therefore, we should remember that whatever we do is unto the Lord. Whenever you work-whatever work that may be-please say to the Lord, "O Lord, I do this to You. The reason I do this is because of You!" In this way, all our works in the world will be sanctified to the Lord. In everything we do, we can serve the Lord. However, if the Lord wants us to serve Him solely, we should obey Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALONE WITH GOD</H2><P>God's children quite often are lost among the crowd and therefore lose their fellowship with God. How many distracting things there are in our daily life! How much these distractions have affected our spiritual life! The most serious mistake of believers is to associate themselves too much with people and have too little fellowship with God.</P><P>People have asked me, "How can I feel the Lord's presence more, and how can I have a better understanding of the Lord's love?" My reply is that you have to fellowship with the Lord all the time. You should be alone, face to face with the Lord, to meditate over His Word and on His deeds. You should ask Him to show you what He wants you to do, and you should tell Him the sorrows and desires of your heart. Peacefully rest in His presence. Lift up your head to the sky, listen to His small voice, and behold His lovely face. At least half an hour each day (the more the better), you should take the Bible with you and go away from your family and folks; you may walk alone in the wilderness, or quietly sit on top of a hill, or stay alone in a certain place, or quietly stay in your room. You should kneel before the Lord and fellowship with God the Father and the Lord Jesus, His Son, in quietness. If you do this, you will see His power manifested in you. His glory, His love, and His holiness will be much more real to you day by day.</P><P>I feel the biggest lack among today's believers is their lack of a quiet time with God. Believers care too much for social encounters and for conversation with people. They have neglected their fellowship with God. It would be good if we could say together with Jeremiah, "Because of Your hand I sat alone" (Jer. 15:17).</P><P>The high-flying bird is not with the flock. Birds such as the eagle always roam alone in the sky. The more a saint's spiritual life develops and grows, the more he feels he cannot join company with others, or walk together with others in spiritual matters. It seems that besides the Lord, no one can be his company. This is a kind of loneliness of sanctification! These people are like the poet, who was "as a sparrow alone upon the house top" (Psa. 102:7). In their life there is a kind of quietness, serenity, and peace that the worldly people do not have. The presence of the Lord is so real that in their speech, conduct, and thought, it seems there is much "heaven," which makes others reckon them as outsiders and heavenly people. What they breathe is the heavenly uncontaminated air.</P><P>Because of such separation from the world, the sanctified life of these ones bears a tremendous impact with them. Wherever they go, they carry such an atmosphere with them, and they touch people with such an atmosphere. "Silence is better than noise."</P><P>But this does not mean that they refuse to live together outwardly with other human beings, as the ancient monks did. It means that their spirit cannot love the world. However, because they know more of God, they love people more, and they become more lovable. It is not because they are peculiar. Spiritually such people are like heavenly people, and outwardly they are filled with Christ's love and tenderness. In their daily life they always set aside a certain time when they physically get away from people to seek after spiritual edification in seclusion.</P><P>What a blessed life this is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LOVE FOR CHRIST</H2><P>Our Lord deserves our adoration. Love must have some kind of expression. Consecration is the very beginning and ending of the expression of love. Where there is love, there must be consecration.</P><P>Today the need among believers is more love and greater consecration.</P><P>However, although love cannot be without consecration, many consecrations can be without love. You may even deliver up your body to be burned, yet there may not be love (1 Cor. 13:3). Every outward deed ought to be motivated by the deep love within a person's heart. Otherwise, outwardly one may be full of acts of consecration, but inwardly he may have left the first love already. The Lord will not accept it. Oh, may the Lord's love cause our hearts to burn, to labor for Him, and to offer ourselves and our goods to the Lord!</P><P>One who loves the Lord would not love Him only in words, but also in deeds and sincerity. How feeble is the love that only loves the Lord with the heart and that has no outward expression!</P><P>The way believers use their money is the thermometer of their love for the Lord.</P><P>How much of your money is used for the Lord? How much is used for yourself, your family, and your children? If you can answer this question, you will know how much you love the Lord.</P><P>Is the work of the Lord less important than the need of our living and the expenses of our children's food and education? Who will please the Lord more, the one who gives what is needed for his living, or the one who gives the surplus?</P><P>Although most believers are poor, still a few are rich. If a person has a heart to love the Lord, even though he is poor, does he not also have his "two mites?" (Mark 12:42). If you love the Lord, how can you not have an expression of the "two mites"?</P><P>To me, the giving of the rich ones is like the crumbs that fall from their table. Do we realize that our Lord was rich, but for our sakes became poor? (2 Cor. 8:9). For this reason, we should also become poor for His sake. The food, clothing, and expenditures of the rich ones have not been reduced for the Lord's sake, and their riches have not been used to help God's work in every place.</P><P>If those rich children of God have a heart to love the Lord, they do not have to deny themselves in their daily life that much, and the temple of the Lord will still be filled up. If they have a fervent heart to love the Lord, not only will their dormant, idle, unused money in the bank flow out everywhere for the use of the Lord, but there will be much self-denial also in their daily rightful blessings in order to please God's heart. However, how many know the joy of giving?</P><P>This should be true not only among the ordinary believers but also among those who work for the Lord. Although they do not have much income, they should not neglect their expression of love for the Lord. The Levites in the Old Testament still needed to offer the tithe. Although what we do is God's work and what we use is God's money, the Lord still cares much for what we offer in tears.</P><P>(But you should be careful that what you offer is for the Lord's use. Today many churches and congregations have left the truth of the Lord! What they preach is not the gospel, and what they do is not according to the will of the Lord. You should be careful not to offer carelessly lest what you offer is not accepted by God, but rather goes to the promotion of heresies.)</P><P>Finally, brothers and sisters, if you bury your money, time, or talent, one day in eternity you will regret that you have not used them for the Lord.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWELVE BASKETS FULL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(5)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 9</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MEDITATION ON CHRIST</H2><P>The four Gospels display the perfect life of the Lord Jesus. The Gospel of Matthew depicts Him as the King; the Gospel of Mark, as the Servant; the Gospel of Luke, as Man; and the Gospel of John, as God. One of our frequent failures in reading the Gospels is to pay brief attention to the words and deeds of Christ only. Indeed, His words and deeds are enough to capture our hearts. But to do only this is a failure. Seldom do we see Christ Himself, and seldom do we behold the Christ that we ought to behold. The reason we study these writings on Christ's words and deeds is that we would know the living Christ.</P><P>This being the case, let us spend some time to meditate on the subject. First, let us meditate on the inspired writings of God. Next, we have to meditate on the Christ who is revealed through these writings. We should sit back quietly, open up the Holy Book, and read a portion of the record of our Lord's excellent life on earth. We should meditate on His wisdom, grace, patience, love, beauty, gentleness, tenderness, meekness, and sympathy. We should meditate on Him until His life jumps out of the pages and our hearts burn in love for Him. He is precious, He is lovely, and He is refined. We should meditate on Him until His fine acts come alive before our eyes and deeply attract us, to the extent that we would desire Him alone and would feel at a loss with anything less than a full possession of Him and a full taste of His love. We should meditate on His acts, to the extent that our life bears the same kindness and grace. We see the Lord's wisdom in His answer concerning the source of His authority, and we see the wonder of His judgment in His answer concerning paying tribute to Caesar. All His acts are fully lovable. Those who meditate on Him will not be disappointed. May we know our Savior more and more.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FULL CARE</H2><P>Coarseness is something that has no place in godly living. Before believers allow God's grace to work in their lives, they have many hard and unrefined areas. To be negligent, to be inconsiderate of others, and to neglect caring for others are the common illnesses of the saints. However, these are things that even the most spiritual saints often neglect. If a person is only slightly careless, he will find himself unable to tend to everything properly. All those who are unable to control their mind properly have this problem. To be negligent is a characteristic of those who do not have full control of their mind. These people are mostly undisciplined in their mind. Their thoughts are complicated, and they themselves do not have the ability to concentrate and to integrate ideas. Since they are careless in their considerations, in many areas they become negligent and show impropriety in the way they treat others and handle matters.</P><P>Another major reason for negligence is to pay too much attention to oneself. Because a person cares too much for his own convenience, he neglects others' needs. While others are asleep, they make noises and disturb others unthinkingly. These noises may even be from praying or studying the Bible! When meetings are called, they keep others waiting for a long time while they tend to their own private affairs. In order to maintain their own name, they open their mouth to slander others. In order to preserve their own interests, they extort and cause damage to others. Because these ones do not have the spirit of the cross, without realizing it they neglect others and do not think of others. Sometimes such behavior can even come from a sincere heart! Yet they are bound to cause others embarrassment. Many times we think that negligence is just frankness, simplicity, and informality! Yet coarseness is never the fruit of the Holy Spirit. What the saints should seek after is that in everything they would be careful, considerate, sensitive not to cause others inconvenience, not to leave their own self-will unchecked, and not to embarrass others. The Lord's cross and the Holy Spirit have a grinding power which can cause the most coarse person in the world to become tender. However, in order to be careful in everything and to be sensitive and caring, there must be the real dying to the self. Only then will a person not care for his own interest and be willing to suffer and to seek for others' benefit in all things. We should exercise our will to control our mind, so that we will not become negligent unconsciously of others' needs. "So then death operates in us, but life in you" (2 Cor. 4:12). The Lord's committing of His mother to the care of others (John 19:26-27) is a real example to us!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRAYER AND DESIRE</H2><P>Prayer is an expression of our desire before God. The Bible records that many people had their prayers answered. Every one of them prayed with a desire. Without a desire, there is no need for prayer. If what we pray for truly comes from the bottom of our heart, surely the answers to our prayers will not be so few. It is because our desire is not single that our prayers become sounding brass and clanging cymbals. The greatest danger to prayer is our attempt to be ornate and to pray according to formal rules. There is more danger in public prayer than in private prayer. Actually, nine times out of ten the long prayers of a "thousand words" are empty prayers. I am afraid such prayers are directed more toward men than toward God. Many times, the content of a prayer is very pleasant, the voice very desperate, and the tone very harmonious. Yet everything is directed toward man. God will not hear nor answer such a prayer. Prayers that are without any desire are a mockery to God. In God's eyes these prayers are detestable. Even when a person prays alone, is it not true that many terms he uses are familiar terms that are uttered without much thought? Because the words have become so familiar, the same words may be uttered without any response from the heart. Such prayers are really a waste of time. They are worse than useless!</P><P>Those who truly understand God and His holiness and majesty will never do such things. If we come to God with a pure heart and realize who He is with whom we have come face to face, would we ever dare to be hypocritical? Actually, we should never pray beyond what the Holy Spirit has prompted us to pray. If we do this, surely it is counterfeit. Hence, it is best to allow the Holy Spirit to place in our spirit the things that we should pray for, so that we will not offend God. We should learn to be honest before God. It is better to have short prayers than false prayers. We should pay all the more attention to this matter when we pray for others. Many supplications are but a kind of payment of debts! Thus, there is no sense of desire, and the whole thing is a mere routine. Therefore, those who do not have a real love for others cannot pray for others. When we feel others' need to be like our own, we will pray sincerely for them. When we feel others' need in the same way they feel it themselves, we will make supplications for them faithfully. It is because there is no love for others that prayers have become mere empty voices. We should sympathize with others more and should identify ourselves with others more. May we henceforth pray with our mouth and also with our heart. May our prayers reach the presence of God like fragrance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOLINESS AND HARDNESS</H2><P>Christians are the most unaffected people. Yet at the same time, they are the most compassionate people. They know only the heavenly things. Other than the Lord Jesus, they have no other loves. This is why they are the most unaffected people. However, they are not selective in their love of men; they love all the brothers, the lovable ones as well as the unlovable ones, and they love even their enemies. This is why they are the most compassionate people. Holiness is the believers' goal. Yet if a person is not careful, his holiness will become others' stumbling block. In our experience, many times our holiness becomes a hardness! The holy believers many times are the difficult ones! The holier they are, the more people in their eyes need to be condemned, and the more merciless will the judgments and criticisms be that follow. The holiness of those who do not fully understand God's grace gives the impression that they are without affection and are simple-minded. Such people will not help others but will only invite criticism. They think that they are uplifting God's standard and bearing a good testimony for God's truth.</P><P>However, they have forgotten that God's holiness belongs to God, while they are human. We have to recognize this fact and should not indiscriminately take God's holiness as our holiness. God in His holiness is imposing and unapproachable, but we are human. Although we are saved and regenerated, we are still human. We should assimilate God's holiness and make it our human holiness. This is what the Lord Jesus did in His life. He was holiness incarnate. On the one hand, in His spirit He was separated from sinners. When Peter saw Him, he had to declare, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord" (Luke 5:8). On the other hand, He is the friend of sinners, publicans, and prostitutes, the men and women despised by the human race. Christ sympathized with them, cared for them, had pity on them, and comforted them. In the first case, He demonstrated His holiness. In the last case, He also demonstrated His holiness. He was not at all unapproachable, nor was He hard in any way. It is good for believers to be holy, but they must not be hard and unapproachable to the extent that others cannot love or admire them. Actually, to be hard is not the same as to be holy. The two are absolutely different. It is right to be holy. Yet this is with respect to the self. Toward ourselves, we should not be afraid of being hard. To give up self-pitying is a signpost to the way of the cross. Yet toward others we should have love and sympathy. God is holy, but this holiness is coupled with grace. We can be holy, but we must not be negligent to the point that we become cold and indifferent like rocks and wood. God has not saved us to become non-human. On the contrary, it was because we had fallen into a non-human condition that He came to save us and make us human. Hence, although we may appear to be the most unaffected people, we should at the same time be the most compassionate people. A truly holy life is never lacking in meekness, peace, goodness, and all the other virtues. We should treat others in the same way that a shepherd cares patiently for his flock. A poured-out life is often a fruit-bearing life. Hardness drives men away, whereas kindness melts men's heart to join us in the heavenly path.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHEN GOD'S GRACE IS MANIFESTED THE MOST</H2><P>God's grace never changes toward us. However, our feeling toward God's grace changes with time. Actually, there is never a moment that God's grace ceases. However, the experience of our enjoyment of God's grace changes. The first condition for the enjoyment of grace is our need. The more need we sense, the more we treasure grace. Those who do not feel any need will not consider God's supply as grace. One failure of the saints is to think that a man needs God's grace only when he is a sinner. It is true that we are saved by God's grace. But we need God's grace all our lives, and there is not a moment when we do not need God's grace. Those who begin with God's grace have to be perfected through God's grace. It is true that God has forgiven our sins and has caused the judgment of our sins to fall on the Lord Jesus. Everyone who believes in Him is saved. Such grace is indeed the greatest. But our heart is most wicked. When we become more advanced in our Christian journey, the Lord may grant us more grace to have more victories, and spontaneously we credit these glories of victories to ourselves and consider ourselves as rather good! Although the Lord remains the same toward us, we do not feel Him and do not sense as much need for Him as before! Because of the deceitfulness of our heart, many times God allows us to fall into temptations or even to be sifted by the devil. When we fail, we condemn and blame ourselves and hate our own sins, thinking that we are sin incarnate and that it would not be too much for the Lord even to condemn us to perdition again. At such times, God shows us His grace. Although we are deep in sins, His grace is sufficient for us, and He is willing to forgive our sins. Although we have failed, He will not forsake us.</P><P>How our hearts then swell in gratitude! How we marvel at the Lord's amazing grace! Although we are hopeless sinners, He is still willing to bestow grace and mercy upon us, and He still cares for us. This makes us all the more thankful for God's amazing grace, and it causes us to realize that we need His grace moment by moment. If God had not been bestowing grace on us continually, we would have perished long ago in the same way the worldly ones have. Those who know their own sins know the preciousness of God's grace.</P><P>Grace always humbles a person. If a person is not a sinner, he does not need grace. To confess that one is a sinner is to be humble. When the Holy Spirit convicts us of our sins, it is easy at that moment for us to humble ourselves. But how difficult it is for us to judge ourselves day by day and to consider that no good thing is in our flesh! It is not an easy thing for a person to continuously consider himself incapable and unable to perform good. Our heart always wants to glorify itself, thinking that we can and will do good, forgetting God's grace and reckoning that we have no need of it. Only when we have humbled ourselves will we confess that our life in Adam is just corrupt and defiled. Only then will we pursue God's grace. We feel the sweetness of God's grace during the times of our failures. But we should in the same way feel His sweetness all the time. We feel the need to have God's grace when we sin. In the same way we should feel the need for such grace all the time. What a pity that we acknowledge the filth of the Adamic life only when this old Adamic life is activated, but we have a different evaluation of it and are not willing to humble ourselves at other times when the old Adamic life is hidden. May we learn to realize that within our nature and our life, nothing is free from the stain of sin. If we did not have God's grace, we would have perished long ago. Hallelujah! With the Lord there is grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A SENSE OF SIN</H2><P>Although we exalt the Lord's grace, we dare not under- estimate sin. God hates sin, whether it is in the worldly people or in the heart of the saints. It is a glorious thing to preach God's grace, and we should faithfully strive to preach God's salvation. But to preach God's grace and at the same time tolerate man's sin, that is, compromise with and tolerate evil, is not only a misunderstanding of God's grace but an insult to His grace as well. Whether God deals with man according to grace or the law, sin has to be judged and rejected. Those who boast in the name of grace, but still take pleasure in sin, probably do not yet know God's grace. "Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?" (Rom. 6:1). Every regenerated person should answer, "Absolutely not!"</P><P>One thing that breaks the hearts of the faithful saints of God is the fact that man does not consider sin as sin; man has invented many new terms to cover up sin. But the more lamentable thing is that believers, the regenerated ones, have looked too lightly upon sin. What a pity that the consciousness of sin that God has given to many of us is gradually lost. I am not saying that we have not struggled with sin. Indeed we have. At the beginning of his Christian life, every genuinely regenerated person surely has received a new nature that hates and abhors sin. He has probably exercised much strength to oppose sin. But the frequent defeats and frequent victory of sin over him gradually put in him a self-excusing heart. He may think that it is impossible to overcome. To sin has become habitual, and the voice of the accusing conscience is no longer as strong as before. What a degradation this is! Regrettably, these ones may know the teaching of 1 John 1:9 and may taunt God's holiness,  thinking that God's grace means exoneration. If after they sin they will be forgiven as soon as they ask for forgiveness, what should keep them from sinning more? Although they have not said this with their mouth, is not their heart thinking this way? This is the reason that many believers have failed. They have lost their feeling toward sin. The spiritual sense is very similar to the physical senses. If a person suffers too much hurt and goes through too much abuse, his senses will become dull. When we disregard our sins, the feeling of our conscience will become increasingly dull. Every time we sin and do not confess it, and every time we disregard sin, our conscience becomes that much harder. In the end, the evil and loathsomeness of sin is diminished and the feeling toward sin is paralyzed.</P><P>Have we not failed often in the small things? Many times, the conscience does condemn us of the little lies, the little unfaithfulnesses, the little unrighteousnesses, and the little failures. But we comfort ourselves by saying that these things are insignificant. In this way, we push aside the condemnation of the conscience and become calloused. Under such circumstances, our feeling toward sin suffers a killing blow. If we tolerate the condemnation of the conscience once and refuse to confess our sin, we will not be able to remove that sin. Spontaneously, we forego the standard of God's holiness. Indeed, we should not be afraid to be over-sensitive about sin! If we would judge ourselves and remove and reject immediately what our conscience condemns, our feeling toward sin will become more and more sensitive. A victorious saint is a believer who judges himself. Just as a sinner is afraid of the punishment of sin (hell), in the same way a believer should be afraid of the power of sin. We should be careful and not harden our hearts, lest we lose our sensitive feeling toward sin. Once we lose our spiritual feelings, our spiritual life will dry up. Those who disregard sin will despise God's grace as well. Those who know the horror of sin and who have sunk into a state of helplessness will treasure God's grace as rare jewels when they receive it. If we regard sin as insignificant, the grace of forgiveness will be but a common thing.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>NOTES FROM MY BIBLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 14</H2><P>Verse 4:"But the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles." The word "divided" here is the same as the word "divided" used in Luke 12:51-53.</P><P>Verse 5:"And when a hostile attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews with their rulers to treat the apostles outrageously and to stone them..." Positionally, the Jews considered the Gentiles as dogs. How high was the middle wall of partition! Yet in persecuting the saints, how much are they in oneness! The devil has his kind of oneness also!</P><P>Verses 6-7:"They became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region. And there they announced the gospel." They were not running away, but were preaching the gospel!</P><P>Verse 10:"Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he leaped up and began to walk." The apostle's speaking with a loud voice was a fulfillment of the Lord's word: "Whoever...believes that what he says happens, he will have it" (Mark 11:23).</P><P>Verse 15:"And saying, Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like feeling as you, and announce the gospel to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them." "We also are men"-we should remember this. For this reason, preachers should not be worshipped by others. Unfortunately, many have forgotten that they are men.</P><P>Verse 19:"But Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, supposing that he was dead." The zeal of the messengers of Satan can almost be compared to that of the apostles! Before "they stoned," did they not try to offer sacrifices to the apostles? If we go along with men's opinion and follow their way to worship God, there will not be any persecution. Men love those who are willing to accept praises! But if we reject the praises, "they stoned"!</P><P>Verse 20:"But as the disciples surrounded him, he rose up and entered into the city. And on the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe." Although the Lord's word was persecuted, it could still rise up. During the past twenty centuries, many times the world has thought that "he was dead"!</P><P>Verse 22:"Establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith and saying that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God." "Them" in this verse refers to the saved believers. The meaning of "enter" is to gain, and "the kingdom of God" means to reign with the Lord. "Must" here points out that this is the only pathway, and "through many tribulations" speaks of the condition for reigning with the Lord. The word "many" means that it is not a one-time thing.</P><P>Verse 27:"And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared the things that God had done with them and that He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles." It was God's work, not their own work. Those who testify should remember this. "He had opened a door." They had suffered for the purpose that others may enter through this door.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 15</H2><P>Verse 2:"And when no little dissension and discussion with them came about through Paul and Barnabas, the brothers directed Paul and Barnabas and certain others among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question." They had "dissension and discussion," because this was related to the matter of salvation.</P><P>Verse 3:"They therefore, having been sent forward by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail about the turning of the Gentiles; and they brought great joy to all the brothers." It was "joy" and not "jealousy."</P><P>Verse 4:"And when they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared the things that God had done with them." The church in Jerusalem and the church in Antioch each had their own administration. They had fellowship one with another, but there was no union. The reason men were sent to Jerusalem was that the circumcised ones were from Jerusalem (vv. 1, 24). In this chapter, we do not find that the two churches united as the churches do today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 8</H2><P>Verse 15: "And after that the Levites shall go in to do the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall cleanse them and shall offer them as a wave offering."  "After that" here means after being fully consecrated to the Lord (vv. 13-14). God does not want us to work for Him before we are fully His. If He has not gained our life, He will not want our work.</P><P>"Offer them as a wave offering." Notice the order here: (1) the atonement-this is our salvation; (2) offer up as a wave offering-this is our consecration; (3) "to Me"-this is the Lord's acceptance; (4) caring for the things of the tabernacle-this is our work of service to the Lord; (5) offer up as a wave offering-this is the second time that they are offered. Is one time not enough? Indeed, we should consecrate ourselves to God all the time. Before we work we have to consecrate, and while we work we also have to consecrate. "Cleanse...offer"-Consecration has much to do with the Lord's holiness.</P><P>Verse 16:"For they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel; instead of all that open the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel, I have taken them for Myself." "Wholly"-may the Lord gain us wholly!</P><P>Verse 17:"For all the firstborn among the sons of Israel are Mine, both of man and of beast, on the day that I slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them to Myself." According to the law, when the Lord has redeemed us and purchased us unto Himself, we belong to Him (1 Cor. 6:19-20).</P><P>Verse 19:"And I have given the Levites as ones given to Aaron and his sons from among the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make propitiation for the sons of Israel, that there may be no plague among the sons of Israel when the sons of Israel  approach the sanctuary." We are God's gift to Christ (John 17:6, 9).</P><P>Verse 24:"This is what pertains to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and above they shall go in to serve in the service of the tent of meeting." Five is the number of man's responsibility before God. The Levites began to serve from the age of twenty-five (five times five), which means that they began working after they were fully ready to take up responsibility (five fives). The period of working was also five times five, which is twenty-five years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROVERBS 16</H2><P>Verse 1:"The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord." The Lord can control our tongues!</P><P>Verse 3:"Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be established." Commitment is an act of faith.</P><P>Verse 6:"By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil." The fear of the Lord is expressed in departing from evil.</P><P>Verse 30:"He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass." Although Proverbs for the most part teaches us to be few in words, sometimes what we say by not speaking is more evil!</P><P>Verse 32:"He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city." "Better than the mighty"-because one has overcome himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 PETER 1</H2><P>Verse 4: "Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust." To be a partaker of the divine nature is to be regenerated. Since a person is regenerated, he should also develop this regenerated life. "For this very reason also, adding all diligence..." (v. 5).</P><P>Verse 11:"For in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly and bountifully supplied to you." In the future, in the glory of the kingdom, believers will be divided into at least two categories: (1) those who are merely saved (1 Pet. 4:18) and (2) those to whom the entrance into the kingdom of our Lord will be richly and bountifully supplied.</P><P>Verse 13:"And I consider it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by a reminder." Ecclesiastes 9:10 says, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 PETER 2</H2><P>Verses 1-2:"But there arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their licentiousness, because of whom the way of the truth will be reviled." "Heresies" and "licentiousness" go together. In order to justify a licentious deed, one has to create a heresy! Sin is nothing but an apostate soul.</P><P>Verses 7-8:"And rescued righteous Lot, who had been oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless (for that righteous man, who settled down among them, in seeing and hearing tormented his righteous soul day after day with their lawless works)." Lot was a social reformer! What is the result? He was being reformed by Sodom instead! He was a saved one, one who was justified by faith, but all his works were burned. The social reformers today will realize their wrong when the fire of 1 Corinthians 3 is manifested.</P><P>Compare verse 10 and verse 11:"And especially those who go after the flesh in the lust for defilement and despise lordship. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble while reviling dignities; whereas angels, though they are greater in strength and power, do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord." Those who despise lordship and revile dignities know not to fear. Even the angels, who are more noble than they are, dared not revile.</P><P>Verse 22:"It has happened to them according to the true proverb: The dog has turned to its own vomit, and the washed sow to wallowing in the mud." These ones are not regenerated yet.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 PETER 3</H2><P>Verse 3:"Knowing this first, that in the last of days mockers will come with mocking, going on according to their own lusts." Because there is lust, there is mocking. Those who despise the Lord's second coming are sick spiritually.</P><P>Verse 5:"For this escapes them by their own choosing, that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth was compacted out of water and through water." The matter escapes them by their own choosing, rather than through their ignorance. We may say that they are deceiving others and deceiving themselves!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 JOHN 1</H2><P>Verse 5:"And this is the message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all." May the Lord be gracious to us so that every time we preach, we announce to others the light we have received from the Lord, rather than speak from our memory. May the Lord guard our mouth so that what we speak every day is what we have heard from the Lord, not from man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 JOHN 2</H2><P>Verse 10:"He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him." Saints are caused to stumble mostly because of men, other believers. But if one loves his brother, there will be no reason for him to be stumbled. The love of the brothers preserves us from being stumbled. The wile of Satan is to plant the seed of jealousy into the heart of men and cause this seed to germinate at the right opportunity, thus causing men to be stumbled. Here it says, "loves his brother," not "loves some of his brothers."</P><P>Verse 11:"But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes." What a picture of a man under the authority of darkness! The word "brother" means that the hating one and the ones he hates are all saints. But the mind of such a one has been possessed by evil demons, and he will pay any price just to destroy the ones he is jealous of. Sometimes it may not be as severe, yet in his conversation, subconsciously, many critical words come out of him. Indeed, he "walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes." He is not fully blind, but is only blind with regard to that particular matter. This is a condition of demon possession in the saints.</P><P>Verse 14:"I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one." The way to overcome Satan is to have the word of God abiding in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 16</H2><P>Verse 18:"And she did this for many days. But Paul was greatly disturbed; and turning, he said to the spirit, I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour." At the present time, God will not have the spirits preach for him.</P><P>Verse 19:"But when her masters saw that their hope of profit had gone out, they laid hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers." Actually Satan was behind all of this. Although he could do nothing except leave the slave girl (v. 18), he tried to stir up a storm from another angle and cause trouble to the apostles. How diligent is Satan's working!</P><P>Verse 25:"And about midnight Paul and Silas, while praying, sang hymns of praise to God; and the prisoners were listening to them." To have such a voice in such a place! No wonder the prisoners listened.</P><P>Verse 26:"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken. And instantly all the doors were opened and everyone's bonds were unfastened." They were not moved by the power on earth. This is why they could shake the earth.</P><P>Verse 34:"And he brought them up into his house and set a table before them; and he exulted because he had believed in God with all his household." Satan thought that by putting them into prison, they could put them to death. Little did he know that it was God who sent them to the prison to save the jailer and his whole household. How often has Satan miscalculated! How can he compete with God?</P><P>The jailer and his household were baptized. There was no infant. "He exulted because he had believed in God with all his household." If they could exult through believing in God, none of them could have been infants.</P><P>Verse 40:"And they went out from the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they saw the brothers, they exhorted them and went forth." They exhorted the others instead of being exhorted by them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 17</H2><P>Verse 2:"And according to his custom Paul went in to them, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures." He was not keeping the Sabbath, but merely seizing the opportunity while they were together to "reason" with them.</P><P>Verses 11-12: "Now these people were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so. Therefore many of them believed, and there were not a few Greek women of high standing and men." If one reads the Bible without prejudice, surely he will believe.</P><P>Verse 16:"And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols." What we lack in these days are such provoked ones.</P><P>Verse 21:"(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners sojourning there spent their time on nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)" The men of Athens listened to news, while the men of Berea searched the Scriptures (v. 11). Many people have time to read the newspaper, but do not have time to read the Bible!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 JOHN 3</H2><P>Verse 2:"Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be. We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is." "Now we are"-now we are saved! How can God's children not be saved?</P><P>Verse 3:"And everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure." The "even as" in verse 3 is for now, while the "even as" in verse 2 is for the future. We should have the first "even as" now, and then we will have the second "even as" in the future.</P><P>Verse 5:"And you know that He was manifested that He might take away sins; and sin is not in Him." Only He who has no sin can remove sins. How can sinful preachers save sinners? The "manifested" in verse 5 is His first coming, whereas the "manifested" in verse 2 is His second coming. The first coming removes man's sins, and the second coming delivers man's body.</P><P>Verse 6:"Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him or known Him." The verb "sin" here should be translated as "continue in sin."</P><P>Verse 7: "Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who practices righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous." This is righteousness in our conduct, which is different from the righteousness one receives when he is justified by faith.</P><P>Verse 8:"He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil." The Lord was manifested to do two things: to destroy the works of the devil, and to remove man's sins (v. 5).</P><P>Verse 13:"Do not marvel, brothers, if the world hates you." There are a few things which we should not marvel at: (1) the oppression of the poor (Eccl. 5:8), (2) the regeneration of the sinner (John 3:7), (3) the power of Christ (John 5:28), and (4) saints being hated (1 John 3:13).</P><P>Verse 14:"We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers. He who does not love abides in death." We love because this one is a brother and is begotten of God. We should not love only those brothers whom we love, and we should not only love those who love us, but we should "love the brothers"-all the brothers. How can man's love today come up to such a standard?</P><P>Verse 16:"In this we know love, that He laid down His life on our behalf, and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers." Those who do not know that the Lord has died for us do not know what love is.</P><P>Verse 17:"But whoever has the livelihood of the world and sees that his brother has need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him?" Giving is the outlet of love. To hold back from giving is to shut up this outlet. Those who shut up their affections toward their brother cannot love God the Father. One should give simply because the other is a brother. Any other motive will not please God. Many charities are but an effort to silence the urging of love! It is hard to find those who give because of a true love for the brothers!</P><P>Verse 18:"Little children, let us not love in word nor in tongue but in deed and truthfulness." Not only in "deed" but in "truthfulness" as well. Many deeds of love are not truthful!</P><P>Verse 22:"And whatever we ask we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight." It is difficult to find a believer who is not ashamed in his heart (vv. 20-21), much less to find one who keeps God's commandments.</P><P>Verse 24:"And he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And in this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us." God abides in us through the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 JOHN 4</H2><P>Verse 1:"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." Prove first and then believe, not believe first and then prove. Without proving, one should not believe, and one should not believe in anything that has not been proven. "But prove!"</P><P>Verse 2:"In this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God." To "confess" means to acknowledge voluntarily. If you get an answer that does not answer what is asked, it must be an evil spirit. Concerning this kind of question, any answer other than "Yes, yes; No, no" (Matt. 5:37) cannot be considered a "confessing." The Lord Jesus says that "for anything more than these is of the evil one."</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>NOTES FROM MY BIBLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1 JOHN 4</H2><P>Verse 4:"You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world." We do not have to search elsewhere, for He is already in us. We overcome because the One who is in us is greater than the evil spirits. We do not have to be afraid of the world, because what is in the world is only the evil spirits.</P><P>Verse 5:"They are of the world; therefore they speak out of the world, and the world hears them." Those who can gain the majority of the world to hear them and who themselves remain part of the world must have some problems with them; they must be of the evil spirits.</P><P>Verse 6:"We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception." Those who would not follow the teaching of the apostles and, in particular, the teaching of John, are those who willingly follow the spirit of deception.</P><P>Verse 7:"Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God." Love is the greatest test.</P><P>Verses 8-13:"He who does not love has not known God, because God is love. In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him. Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God has loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another. No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit."</P><P>Who is love? God.</P><P>Who has loved us? God.</P><P>What is love? God sending His Son as a propitiation.</P><P>Where is love manifested? In His sending of His Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.</P><P>What does love inspire us to do? We should love one another.</P><P>How do we love God perfectly? Love one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 24</H2><P>Verse 25:"And as he was reasoning concerning righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will call for you." He was "afraid" and postponed the question of salvation to a later day, thus missing his chance! Now is the most convenient time. If now is not convenient, never will it be "convenient." It is either now or never.</P><P>Verse 26:"Hoping at the same time also that money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore he also sent for him more frequently and conversed with him." The other day he did not want to receive the word of the Lord, but this day he wanted money! Even if he did get Paul to come, his seeking heart for the word had died already.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 25</H2><P>Verse 4:"Festus therefore answered that Paul was being kept in custody in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to proceed there shortly." The way the Lord protected His servant was wonderful! Prior to this (23:12), the Jews plotted against him, and the nephew of Paul came and informed the people. Although this time no one knew their plan, the Lord caused Festus to refuse their suggestion. "All things work together for good" (Rom. 8:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 15</H2><P>Verse 2:"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land of your habitations, which I am giving to you." The Lord was now rejecting the disobedient people and was casting them aside. He was now revealing to Moses how the Israelites who would go into Canaan should act. These ordinances were to have nothing to do with these hundreds of thousands of people!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 18</H2><P>Verse 5:"And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ." Compare this verse with 17:16: "And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols." Wherever a believer is, among other believers or by himself, he should have the same earnestness for the salvation of others.</P><P>Verse 7:"And he left there and went into the house of one named Titius Justus, one who worshipped God, whose house was next to the synagogue." There are not many who worship God whose homes are close to the synagogue.</P><P>Verse 8:"And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his whole household; and many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized." Believe and be baptized.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 19</H2><P>Verse 2:"And he said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? And they said to him, On the contrary, we did not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit." This does not mean that they did not have the Holy Spirit, for as soon as they had believed, they had received the Holy Spirit already (see Rom. 8:9). This is saying that they had not received the Holy Spirit in the way that it was received on the day of Pentecost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 JOHN 5</H2><P>Verse 3:"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome." Our faith has much to do with our conduct.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 JOHN</H2><P>Verse 11:"For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works." Christians should not have anything to do with those who preach heresy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REVELATION 4</H2><P>Verse 1:"After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things." Many people are no longer able to hear God's first voice to them. "The things that must take place after these things." Hence, all the things after chapter four are prophecies, and they are not yet fulfilled.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REVELATION 5</H2><P>Verse 3:"And no one in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it." The angels in heaven, the human beings on earth, and the demons under the earth have all been defeated! Only the Lamb is victorious as God in heaven, man on earth, and among the dead ones in Hades. He is worthy. He is Head over all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 19</H2><P>Verse 2:"This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come." The ashes of the red heifer signifies the cleansing away of the sins of those who have been saved. This signifies the aspect of the daily cleansing of the believers by the precious blood of the Lord.</P><P>Verse 13:"Whoever touches a dead person, the body of any man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah, and that person shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him." The ashes (v. 9) for the purification denote the cross. The living water denotes the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit applies the work of the cross on the sinning believers.</P><P>Verse 20:"But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, for he has defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean." Believers should not sin. If unfortunately they do sin, they should confess their sins and ask for the cleansing of the Lord's precious blood (1 John 1:7-9). Otherwise, they "shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation." This does not mean eternal perdition because the effect of the blood of the Passover lamb is still with them. This only means that they will be removed from the midst of the congregation of God's holy people. The eternal life which they have received through grace still remains, but they have lost their fellowship with God, their communion with the saints, and their reward as God's people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROVERBS 21</H2><P>Verse 28:"A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly." Such an act is forbidden even if it is done in the name of the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROVERBS 22</H2><P>Verse 9:"He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor." May all the parents always practice this verse!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JEREMIAH 26</H2><P>Verses 2-3:"Thus says Jehovah, Stand in the court of the house of Jehovah and speak to all the cities of Judah, who come to worship in the house of Jehovah, all the words which I command you to speak to them, and do not take away a word. Perhaps they will listen and turn, every one from his evil way, that I may repent of the evil which I intend to do to them because of the evil of their deeds." "Perhaps" --this is a hope. Only by preaching faithfully the whole counsel of God can we hope to save others.</P><P>Verse 14:"As for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your eyes." How faithful are the words in verses 12 and 13. "As for me" --if it pleases God that everyone repents, His mission is fulfilled, and it is all right even if I die. This is indeed the "testimony" of those who "loved not their soul-life even unto death" (Rev. 12:11).</P><P>Verse 15:"Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon her inhabitants; for truly Jehovah has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears." This is not his self-pitying, but a concern for the future of those who tried to take his life. What a love this is! This is not a threat of anger which says, "Kill me..and you will see...."</P><P>Verses 23-24:"And they brought Uriah out of Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, and he struck him with the sword and threw his corpse into the graves of the common people. Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to put him to death." To the Lord, the testimony of the martyr and that of the living prophets are equally precious.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 8</H2><P>Verse 1:"And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him." Many were those who followed, but few were there who were true worshippers of the Lord! In fact there was only one.</P><P>Verses 8-10:"But the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not fit for You to enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it. Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, With no one in Israel have I found such great faith." Faith is not what we see. The Lord's word does not depend on human feelings. Faith is to care for nothing else and to take the Lord's word as real.</P><P>Verses 31-34:"And the demons entreated Him, saying, If You cast us out, send us into the herd of hogs. And He said to them, Go! And they came out and went into the hogs. And behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the waters. And those who were feeding them fled and went away into the city and reported everything, including what had happened to those possessed by demons. And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they entreated Him to depart from their borders." Here are two entreaties: the demons entreated that they be allowed to enter the hogs, and men entreated that the Savior leave them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 11</H2><P>Verses 20-24:"Then He began to reproach the cities in which most of His works of power took place, because they did not repent: Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. And you, Capernaum, who have been exalted to heaven, to Hades you will be brought down. For if the works of power which took place in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained until today. But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you." The Lord is showing us clearly here the vanity of the result of social services. Who can serve more powerfully than Christ did? Yet what was the result? He had to rebuke the ones whom He served! The Lord's commandment at present is not to do social service, but to preach the gospel to all nations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 16</H2><P>Verses 21, 28:"From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and on the third day be raised." "Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." The cross is related to the kingdom. Verse 21 is a prophecy, whereas verse 28 is a revelation.</P><P>Verse 27:"For the Son of Man is to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each man according to his doings." "Doings" refers to the act of saving one's soul-life or losing one's soul-life in verse 25.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 17</H2><P>Verse 8:"And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone." Do not say too quickly, "Hear Him," for this hearing may refer to 16:21.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 24</H2><P>Verses 1-2:"And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple.

How cold is our Lord toward the world! The temple can be compared to the world. He passed through this world without giving heed to it. The disciples, on the other hand, were drawn to the beauty and attractive things of the world. There is a reason for the Lord's coldness; He knew that the world would be destroyed. "Since all these things are to be thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness" (2 Pet. 3:11). Men love the world because they think that the world will last forever. Little do they realize that the heaven and the earth will be annulled. Blessed are those who understand 1 John 2:17!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 25</H2><P>Verse 3:"For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them." The foolish ones are foolish not because they have not prepared the oil. The failure to prepare the oil is only a manifestation of their foolishness.</P><P>Verse 4:"But the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps." How troublesome it is to have another extra vessel! The world's tone is always, "Why bother to serve the Lord so seriously?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 26</H2><P>Verses 69-75:"Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean. But he denied it before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about! And after he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene. And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man! And after a little while those who were standing there came to Peter and said, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech also makes it clear that you are. Then he began to curse and to swear: I do not know the man! And immediately a rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly." Perhaps Peter thought that it was better to deny the Lord and save his life for future use, rather than confess the Lord and lose his life then! Little did he realize that this was a mournful act (v. 75).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MATTHEW 27</H2><P>Verse 4:"Saying, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see to that yourself!" Judas knew his sins but would not trust in the Lord's grace. This made him a "son of perdition."</P><P>Verse 18:"For he knew that it was because of envy that they had delivered Him up." The sin of Pilate!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 CORINTHIANS 6</H2><P>Verses 13-14:"Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us up through His power." Food and the stomach --both will perish. The Lord and the body --both have gone through or will go through resurrection.</P><P>Verse 15:"Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!" Food and the stomach are joined as one. In the same way our body and the Lord are also joined as one; we are the members of His Body.</P><P>Verse 16:"Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For He says, `The two shall be one flesh.'" Those who are joined to a prostitute, like food joined to the stomach, will become one body with her.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 CORINTHIANS 8</H2><P>Verses 1-2:"Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know." Knowledge is versus love. Man has nothing to boast of concerning what he knows, for he still does not know what he ought to know. However, knowledge always puffs up, whereas love builds up. When there is love, one does not care for what he knows; rather, he takes care of others' ignorance and will not cause others to stumble through his own liberty.</P><P>Verse 3:"But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him." The greatest love is the love to God, and the greatest knowledge is to be known by God.</P><P>Verse 12:"And sinning in this way against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ." Those who wound others have wounded Christ. To put it another way, those who love others love God. Those who love God have the real knowledge (v. 3). Hence, those who have caused others to stumble through their knowledge are not loving others; they do not love God, and they are void of knowledge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 CORINTHIANS 9</H2><P>Verses 9-10:"For in the law of Moses it is written: `You shall not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain.' Is it for oxen that God cares? Or does He say it altogether for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written because the plowman should plow in hope, and he who threshes, in hope of partaking." This is the way to interpret the Old Testament.</P><P>Verse 19:"For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more." All those who truly love the Lord have such experience.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>1 CORINTHIANS 10</H2><P>Verse 4:"And all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ." "Followed them." Where God's people are, there is God's Christ also. Although they were wandering in the wilderness, He had not forsaken them. What grace this is!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>NOTES FROM MY BIBLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 9</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>MATTHEW 28</H2><P>Verse 5:"And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified." He was not talking to the "shaking" Roman soldiers (v. 4). The Lord cares for His children!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MARK 7</H2><P>Verse 7:"But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men." It is good to worship God. But if a person adds anything to God's commandment, it is vain even to worship God.</P><P>Verse 29:"And He said to her, Because of this word, go. The demon has gone out of your daughter." Lord, even if You try me in the most severe way and do not fulfill my wishes, but cause me to suffer in my heart and soul, may You grant me enough strength to say, "Lord, You are right!" Humility and hope were the reason the woman was blessed.</P><P>Verse 32:"And they brought to Him one who was deaf and who spoke with difficulty, and they entreated Him to lay His hand on him." A deaf person cannot hear God's commandments, whereas one who speaks with difficulty cannot communicate God's message. Most believers who are deaf have difficulty with speaking also. The reason believers have difficulty speaking is that they are deaf. Believers either have both or have none.</P><P>The people wanted the Lord Jesus to lay His hand on them. But He did not act according to their instructions, because He knows what to do. We should know that our Lord is not under our direction. Oh, how often we direct the Lord in our prayers, rather than being directed by Him!</P><P>Verse 33:"And He took him aside from the crowd privately and put His fingers into his ears, and He spat and touched his tongue." "Aside from the crowd"-this was the first step the Lord took in His work. If we want the Lord to heal our ears and tongue, He has to lead us aside from the crowd to meet Him face to face in solitude.</P><P>May the Lord's hand and His spittle heal us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MARK 14</H2><P>Verses 10-11:"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went off to the chief priests to deliver Him up to them. And when they heard this, they rejoiced and promised to give him money. And he sought a way to deliver Him up opportunely." Verse 10 implies a resolution in the will. But before the exercise of the will, there was first the exercise of the mind (John 12:4). The sequence of the devil's work of temptation is as follows: (1) First there is a thought in the mind (vv. 4-5), (2) then the will agrees with the thought (Mark 14:10), (3) then the mind schemes to carry out what the will has resolved to do (v. 11), and (4) finally there is the actual carrying out (14:43). These are the steps with which Satan tempts man. Hence, we have to oppose him as soon as the thoughts come.</P><P>Verse 31:"But he went on speaking more intensely, Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You! And they all said similarly." How safe it is to believe in the Lord's word and His enlightening! Although we trust so much in ourselves, the Lord is more trustworthy.</P><P>Peter trusted in himself, whereas Christ trusted in the word (v. 27).</P><P>It is difficult to stand against one's own feeling to believe in God, yet it is more difficult to escape from the crisis that results from not believing in this way.</P><P>Verses 47, 50:"But a certain one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear." "And they all left Him and fled." It was because of the lack of watching and praying that there was such a blunder.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MARK 16</H2><P>Verses 3-4:"And they said to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb? And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, for it was extremely large." Do not be anxious for the things that are not yet here. When the things happen, the Lord will take care of them.</P><P>Verse 6:"And he said to them, Do not be alarmed. You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has been raised; He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him." There is a similar word in 15:47. The phrase "saw where He was laid" in 15:47 proves that He was dead. The phrase "Behold the place where they laid Him" (16:6) proves that He has resurrected. The Lord's burial, in retrospect, proves His death, and, in looking forward, proves His resurrection. The empty tomb is the evidence of His resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LUKE 1</H2><P>Verses 18, 20:"And Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years." "And behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things happen, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time." Those who want evidences by which they could believe do not believe at all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 CORINTHIANS 3</H2><P>Verse 16:"But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away." First the heart has to turn; then the veil is removed. Man always wants to remove the veil first and then turn!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 CORINTHIANS 5</H2><P>Verse 1:"For we know that if our earthly tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens." Our present body is a "tabernacle," whereas the resurrected body is a "dwelling."</P><P>Verse 3:"If indeed, being clothed, we will not be found naked." "Naked"-a soul without a body cannot appear before God.</P><P>Verse 14:"For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died." "The love of Christ constrains us" to be "beside ourselves...to God" and "sober-minded...for you" (v. 13). The love that dies a vicarious death is the love that constrains.</P><P>"The love of Christ constrains us" so that men "no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised." "He died for all that those...may...live."</P><P>Verse 17:"So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new." Hence, "know no one according to the flesh."</P><P>Verse19: "Namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation." God and man met in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 CORINTHIANS 6</H2><P>Verses 8-12:"Through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true; as unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death; as made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things. Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians; our heart is enlarged. You are not constricted in us, but you are constricted in your inward parts." How can the world understand this? When unbelievers see this, they will think that this is a riddle! The world does not know how to reconcile these two contradicting facts. Yet how real they are in our experience!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>2 CORINTHIANS 7</H2><P>Verse 2:"Make room for us; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one." "We have taken advantage of no one"-to take advantage of others is a defilement of flesh (v. 1). To take advantage of someone is to try to benefit oneself. Those who are faithful in the small things are faithful in the great things.</P><P>Verse 3b:"For I have said before that you are in our hearts for our dying together and our living together." One has to have such a heart before he is qualified to rebuke others!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 23</H2><P>Verse 4:"And God met Balaam; and he said to Him, I have set up seven altars, and I have offered upon each altar a bull and a ram." He thought that God could be moved by his sacrifices just because he was touched by the money.</P><P>Verse 9: "For from the top of the rocks I see him, / From the hills I behold him. / Behold, a people that will dwell alone, / And will not reckon themselves among the nations!" "Dwell alone...not reckon themselves among the nations!" This is the believers' position. We are those who do not belong to this world.</P><P>Verse 21:"He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob; / Nor has He seen trouble in Israel. / Jehovah their God is with them, / And the shout of a king is among them." This was the position of Israel-a position under the blood of the lamb. How different is this from their experience! We have to differentiate between position and experience.</P><P>Verses 22-23:"God brings them out of Egypt; / He has as it were the horns of the wild ox. / For there is no enchantment against Jacob, / And no divination against Israel. / Now it shall be said of Jacob / And of Israel, What God has wrought!" "Out of Egypt"-this is salvation by grace through the blood. "The horns of the wild ox"-this is to receive the power of the Holy Spirit. With the experience of the cross and Pentecost, one can overcome all the attacks of Satan. "Enchantment...divination"-these are the weapons of the power of darkness. But they cannot harm us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 27</H2><P>Verses 13-14:"And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was gathered, because you rebelled against My word in the wilderness of Zin during the strife of the assembly, to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)" This is one result of sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 29</H2><P>Verse 6:"In addition to the burnt offering of the new month and its meal offering, and the continual burnt offering and its meal offering, and their drink offerings, according to the ordinance for them for a satisfying fragrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah." Holiness is related to rest.</P><P>Every verse in chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine has to do with the sacrifices. In all of God's dealing with us, there is the merit of the cross to supply us.</P><P>Verses 1-6:"And on the first day of the seventh month  you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work. To you it shall be a day of the blowing of trumpets. And you shall offer a burnt offering for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah: one young bull, one ram, seven lambs a year old without blemish; as well as their meal offering of fine flour mingled with oil, three tenths of an ephah for the bull, two tenths for the ram, and one tenth for each of the seven lambs; and one male goat as a sin offering, to make propitiation for you; in addition to the burnt offering of the new month and its meal offering, and the continual burnt offering and its meal offering, and their drink offerings, according to the ordinance for them for a satisfying fragrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah." The day of the blowing of the trumpets is a type of the saints' rapture to the air. Without the Lord's burnt offering (obedience to God's will), the meal offering (the holy life), and the sin offering, we will miss the rapture!</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>NOTES FROM MY BIBLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(4)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>NUMBERS 31</H2><P>Verse 2:"Avenge the sons of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered to your people." May we overcome the enemy before we die.</P><P>Verse 3:"And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute Jehovah's vengeance on Midian." When we fight with Satan, we are avenging the Lord. Although God can avenge His own foes, He wants His people to work with Him.</P><P>Verse 7:"And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah commanded Moses, and slew every male." Obedience leads to victory.</P><P>Verse 9:"And the sons of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and they took as plunder all their cattle, all their livestock, and all their goods." The enemy always tries to defeat us in the midst of our victory.</P><P>Verse 19:"And encamp outside the camp seven days; whoever of you has killed any person and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day." The most necessary thing after a victory is to purify ourselves.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ECCLESIASTES 7</H2><P>Verse 4:"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth." "The wise" feel this way, and "the fools" give themselves to indulgence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN 9</H2><P>Verse 4:"We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work." Compare this with verse 5. "Day" refers to the time when Christ was on earth, whereas "night" refers to the time when Christ has left the earth.</P><P>Verses 8-9:"The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg? Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am the one." An inevitable condition after a person is saved is "to be like him and yet not be like him."</P><P>Verse 16:"Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them." This division lasts until today.</P><P>Verse 25:"Then he answered, Whether or not He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see." This is the best testimony in the world.</P><P>Verse 29:"We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from." They did not know where He came from, yet they "knew" that He was a "sinner" (v. 24)!</P><P>Verse 35:"Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and He found him and said, Do you believe into the Son of God?" It is both inadequate as well as useless (Matt. 16) to believe that the Lord is a prophet (John 9:17). This is why the Lord also taught the man who had been blind that He is the Son of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 32</H2><P>Verse 5:"And they said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not take us across the Jordan." The rest of Canaan is a type of the millennial kingdom. But before one enters Canaan, he has to cross the river Jordan. Those who have not died with the Lord cannot reign with Him. The descendants of Reuben and Gad wanted to: (1) come into rest without crossing the Jordan, and (2) come into rest before the rest of the family came to rest. How inferior is the joy and pleasure of this world compared with that of the millennial kingdom!</P><P>Verses 33-42:"And Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land and its cities with their territories, the cities of the land all round. And the sons of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, Bethnimrah and Bethharan, fortified cities, and sheepfolds. And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, Nebo, and Baal-meon, (the names being changed), and Sibmah; and they gave other names to the cities which they built. And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it. And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he settled in it. And Jair the son of Manasseh went and captured their villages, and called them Havvoth-jair. And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name." The land received by the two and a half tribes stood in opposition to that received by the other nine and a half tribes. But though this land was good, it was dangerous! Please read 2 Kings 10:32-33 and 1 Chronicles 5:26. Besides God's will, there is no rest in this world!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN 11</H2><P>Verse 4:"But when Jesus heard it, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it." With such a word from the Lord, even when a person dies, he will still be delivered from death. The Lord looks at the final outcome. Hence, when the Lord leads us through a death that is not really death (such as the one experienced by Lazarus), we should believe in the Lord's word which says, "not unto death."</P><P>Verse 6:"When therefore He heard that he was sick, He remained at that time in the place where He was for two days." He loved all three of them (v. 3). Yet He stayed for two more days. This shows that the Lord knows how to put His soul under subjection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN 12</H2><P>Verse 25:"He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life." "Soul-life" is the soul, whereas "eternal life" is the spirit.</P><P>This was the most successful time of the Lord's life. In verses 11 and 12, there were many Jews who had believed. In verses 20 and 21, even the Gentiles came to worship Him. Indeed, "the world has gone after Him" (v. 19). It would have been very easy for the Lord to lead them to believe in Him through His teachings and His power. How easy was the environment!</P><P>But the Father intended Him to die (v. 27). All those who do not submit to the Father are not from the Spirit. Although His ability, which is divine, was well able to attract others, He was not willing to walk according to the soul-life. He chose death. He put His soul-life to death. This is the way to fruit-bearing.</P><P>Verses 31-32:"Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the ruler of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself." The Lord's death is the casting out of Satan.</P><P>Verses 36b, 42:"Jesus said these things, and He went away and was hidden from them." "Nevertheless even many of the rulers believed into Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue." Who can have natural abilities higher than those of the Lord Jesus? Yet such was the result of His natural ability! If even He had to die, how much more do we have to die?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOHN 11</H2><P>Verse 39:"Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was deceased, said to Him, Lord, by now he smells, for it is the fourth day that he is there." All those whose eyes are on "the fourth day" will despair, be sorrowful, and weep. We thank the Lord that on the fifth day Lazarus came alive.</P><P>Verse 35:"Jesus wept." The Lord Jesus knew that His friend would resurrect. Yet He wept because He sympathized with men.

"Encumbrance" and "sin" are two hurdles of Satan. He wants us to sin. If we do not sin, he will try to put burdens, sorrows, grief, apathy, and depression on our hearts. The way to overcome is to exercise our will. To "put away" is an act of the will. This means that we have to exercise our will reject sin and reject the burdens.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FILLERS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>"NEITHER WILL I CONDEMN THEE"<br>(JOHN 8:11)</H2><P>How precious is this word!

How could the holy Lord not criticize this sin! Yet He said, "Neither do I condemn you." What love! What forgiveness! May we believers have such a spirit! We seem to have a natural ability to criticize others. Weak brothers inevitably make mistakes and have many flaws in their conduct. In these cases, we should have the forgiving spirit of the Lord. If the Lord can forgive and not condemn them, should we not take the same attitude? Indeed, God forgives men more readily than we forgive men. It is a sad fact that the saints are the quickest to condemn others. May we be as merciful as the Father. If we are not filled with the love of Golgotha and not melted by His love, we can never "love one another." Those who know and have tasted the Lord's love know how to love others. Fallen and stumbled brothers do not need our condemnation. They need our sympathy and support of love. Indignant criticism will only make them sorrowful and will not result in any profit. May the Lord remind us all the time of these words: "Neither do I condemn you."</P><P>However, there is one word which we would say to those who are unsaved.

All of us should have a heart of love every day and should apply such love and add to such love a desire for the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 19</H2><P>If men pay attention to me and praise me more than they praise the Lord, may the Lord cause me to fail.</P><P>Just when I am proud of myself and delighted with myself, Lord, humble me below Thy feet.</P><P>When I love people or things more than the Lord, may the Lord cause these people and things to turn against me.</P><P>Lord, if there is anything in my heart that I boast of, may these things that I considered worthy of boasting fail me completely.</P><P>I would rather see myself making mistakes, and confessing my own untrustworthiness, and turning away from trusting in myself, than to see my own goodness and praise myself in private for being trustworthy in myself. Lord, whenever I think that I deserve any merit or trust, may You cause what I consider trustworthy to fail! In this way, when You have perfected me to the point where I will make no more mistakes, I will not dare to uplift my "self" before the Lord and before men, and I will not any longer trust in my "self."</P><P>I would rather that others see me not zealous, than to have the Lord see me zealous outside of His will.</P><P>If we pay more attention to the work than to the Lord Himself, what will become the goal of our work?</P><P>Believers are too prone to work for men and for the Lord, but neglect the Lord's work within the believers. This is why they are anxious beyond reason when they have no work. Give some time to the Lord to work on us!</P><P>If one does not go up to Mount Moriah, he will not see the Lord's preparation. But how many are there who will go up to the mountain? Who will go up willingly? Let us go up to the Lord's mountain!</P><P>"Know and do it"-and not know and talk about it.</P><P>If we hate ourselves because we are shamed by others, and not because we have seen the Lord's glory, we are still loving ourselves and are not hating ourselves.</P><P>When the things the Lord wants to destroy are destroyed, men grieve over them and weep for them. If we are after the Lord's heart, will we do the same?</P><P>It is easier to put the sacrifice on the altar that sanctifies the offerings, than to tie the sacrifice with the love-cord by the altar.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FELLOWSHIP</H2><P>He Himself is better than all the works that His grace has done on us. Through excessive labor we can accomplish zealous works while neglecting personal fellowship with the Lord. Such negligence not only reduces the value of our work, but robs us of the qualification for the highest work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S FAITHFULNESS</H2><P>Dear friends, if there is a living God, who is faithful and true, may we grasp hold of His faithfulness. If there is a happy eternity that will be a reward to those who love Him, and if He indeed will not hold back one good thing from those who walk in an upright way, may we lay hold of God's faithfulness and be worthy of Him in our walk.</P><P>Many believers sigh and lose their strength of joy and their opportunity to help others through losing hold of God's faithfulness!</P><P>How easy is it to think that we are trusting in God when there is money in the pocket and food on the shelf. But even while our faith has failed, His faithfulness remains unshaken.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S WORD</H2><P>The living God is still living, and the living word is still the living word, upon which we can rely. We can glue ourselves to any word which God has spoken or has written through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</P><P>Those who begin the day by feeding well in the morning watch hour and those who delight in the law of Jehovah and who meditate in it day and night mingle their faith with the word and are nourished and strengthened spiritually.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BENEFICIAL WORKS</H2><P>Mere knowledge of the truth may not make you rejoice in your work or benefit you. If we are merely exercising our knowledge, we will find that we are very confused! The vitality of the Holy Spirit is within us. When we work, we are under His (the Holy Spirit's) hand. The exercise of our understanding is also important.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUR PRAYER</H2><P>If we want to humble a person, we can ask him about his prayer. I know of no other subject which can cause a person to become sorrowful and penitent. Whether in public prayers or in private prayers, we should always remember the humbling experience of having a reluctant start, a drifting course, and an unsustainable result.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COWARDICE</H2><P>Once a few of us were under an oak tree comparing notes and considering the best method to work. In particular, we discussed the most effective way to preach. One of my friends said, "I always write down my sermons and edit them carefully. If there is anything that would offend any of my audience, I would erase it right away." This was the word of a young pastor who was very eager that others would recognize him. For fear that I had misunderstood him, I asked him again, "Do you mean to say that all the serious words that come from you or from the Bible concerning sin and the fearfulness of the coming judgment can be softened or removed?" He answered, "Yes, if I think that these words will offend my audience, I will do it." I am afraid this honest testimony shows why so many preachers are so powerless among their colleagues. "The fear of man bringeth a snare" (Prov. 29:25). This is indeed true.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 22</H2><P>Work is not my love. I do not know if this is being lazy, but I do know that I love the Lord who is altogether lovely!</P><P>Who says that we should not work for love? What the Lord wants is that we would love Him above everything else! Honestly speaking, the Lord is altogether too lovely!</P><P>The faithfulness which the Lord demonstrates concerning one of my hairs amazes me. This being the case, I have to be faithful all the more in the least thing!</P><P>Is there a difference between the One who is Lord over one of my hairs and the One who is Lord over the heavens? They are the same unique Lord! If this is the case, it is only man who has made a distinction between the greatest and the smallest things.</P><P>What does the Lord Jesus require of individual believers? It is a pure and total love!</P><P>Two people cannot walk side by side on the way of the cross. There can be helpers (like Simon of Cyrene) along the way. But ultimately it is a lonely path.</P><P>All the mistakes come from us. If there is any goodness in us, it is the Lord's grace. What is there to boast of in the wicked self?</P><P>I am so proud because I have nothing left, and I am so proud because God has become my all.</P><P>Those Christians who cannot be related to their environments cannot be related to God's will.</P><P>To consider the sufferings in one's environments is a proof that there is too much self-love.</P><P>We should not commend others for their goodness, for their goodness may be something natural that is from the flesh. If we do this, we will have lifted up their flesh. We should not consider others' shortcomings, for that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and he that is of the flesh cannot please God. If this is the case, what should we consider? We should consider what the Lord's hand has done in a person, and how the Lord's grace has operated in a person. If we do this, what we see, what we commend, and what we praise will be the Lord Himself. We will not deny the Lord's name, nor will we veil His glory.</P><P>Sickness can show us how much we have loved ourselves.</P><P>Brokenness before God will have its manifestation before men.</P><P>Faith is something that is absent in a man who is full.</P><P>The reason that faith is too little is that the self is too great.</P><P>No quick person can run after God.</P><P>If I cannot join myself to God's arrangement, I cannot join myself to the higher life of God.</P><P>The Lord's will is hidden.</P><P>If a prayer does not move us ourselves, it will not move God.</P><P>The degree we are lost in the Lord is the degree we forget about ourselves.</P><P>We have to make a choice: we cannot enjoy both the world and Christ.</P><P>To do the will of God is our utmost goal.</P><P>It is easy for us to humble ourselves when others uplift us. But when one sees those who are lower than he is, that is, those who are inferior to what he is, mistreating him, he becomes conscious of his superiority. It is then that the temptation is the greatest.</P><P>When by faith we acknowledge the fact of being "in Christ," the immediate result is joy.</P><P>The secret of an unsatisfied life many times lies in an unconsecrated will. How wrong and foolish this is!</P><P>Every worker of Christ encounters many hills and valleys, crooked and uneven places in his own particular environment, which only God can deal with. Such a person should not only rejoice in the fact that God's power matches his encounters, but also in the fact that such difficulties many times manifest God's power, and turn them into open and wonderful things.</P><P>We believe that the time has arrived for us to perform all that He has commanded us to do. By His grace we have to do it, and not just try to do it. We do not see a commandment in the Bible that tells us to try to do anything. "To try" is the slogan of the unbelieving ones. In our experience, "to try" means "to fail."</P><P>God cannot, will not, and does not bless those who live in disobedience.</P><P>We see that the way the apostles work is not through many ways and means, but through themselves going out, and trusting in His sure word: "Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you" (Matt. 6:33).</P><P>Selfishness will corrupt a person, but obedience will lead to blessing. God commanded Noah and his sons to fill the earth, but they said, "Let us build us a city, and a tower....lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth" (Gen. 11:4). Before God scattered them, He confounded their language. If we want to learn to know Him more and know Him fully, we have to live out the life of God.</P><P>If we are faithful to God in the small things, we will gain the experience and the strength which will become our help in more severe trials.</P><P>God does not give His glory to others. Many times He conceals the result of His work. He does this to remove man's pride.</P><P>Be careful of your mind and of the condition and habits of your heart. Occasional good works and words are only brief performances; the nature that is subconsciously with us is the true expression of spiritual growth, and it is the virtue which builds up the fine fragrance.</P><P>How quick we are to identify the power of money, unions, education, class, appearance, and discernment, more than the power of the Holy Spirit. How we love the glory of visible things more than the One who is invisible.</P><P>The only prayers that will be answered are those that are one with God's manifested will. "If we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him" (1 John 5:14-15). Unless we have God's word abiding in us, how can we know for sure that what we ask is according to His will?</P><P>Do not have a concert before tuning the instruments. In the same way we should start the day with God's word and prayer. The first thing is to be one with Him.</P><P>Whenever, wherever, and whatever brings you a burden, you should stop. Come to Jesus to receive rest. Lay your head upon His breast, pour out your burden upon His ears, and rejoice in His love. In this way, after you have rest and joy, "whatever He says to you, do" (John 2:5). You will see that this short word will take you on a long journey.</P><P>Whenever the inner being surrenders, Jesus reigns, and whenever Jesus reigns, there is rest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><P>If I pour a glass of wine into water and mix them together, the water will be in the wine, and the wine will be in the water. In the same way, our walk should express the Savior who is living within us.</P><P>The fruit we bear should be grapes, that is, the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and not works of the flesh.</P><P>What you need is not a great faith, but faith in a great God.</P><P>How do we gain Christ? By offering up to Him what we consider as precious, and bearing willingly every loss and the crosses dispensed by the Father's love. If we want to fellowship with Christ, we have to draw near to Him. If we want to meditate on His person and His work, we must not neglect applying His grace and meditating on His word. Many people do not abide in the Lord because they do not know how to eat; rather they fast.</P><P>If the workers of the Lord know indeed that they are the temple of the living and true God, and that they belong to, are ruled by, and are used by the Almighty One, they will have no place for "cowardice," for before the Lord, rocks can turn to pools, and boulders into springs.</P><P>Those who mingle faith with the word will see that their yoke is light and their burden easy. He will fulfill His work within them. For those who acknowledge this supernatural power, the life of faith is undoubting. The way of faith is not a risky one.</P><P>Our need today is great and pressing. God is greater and nearer, because He is everything! All is fine and shall be fine.</P><P>Workers of the Lord should beware that in everything they do not trust in the wonderful grace of God more than in God Himself.</P><P>Without the Lord's protection, nowhere can we find peace. With His protection, everywhere is peace.</P><P>We need a kind of faith that rests in a great God, that waits on Him to keep His own word and to accomplish according to His promise.</P><P>To me, borrowing money is unscriptural. It is to try to get what God has not given to us while knowing clearly that God withholds the good things from us for good reasons.</P><P>Satan can build a fence around us to stop us from going forward, but he cannot cover us to stop us from going upward.</P><P>The more we know the Lord, the more we will realize that the Lord is everything.</P><P>Faith walks by setting its eyes on the Lord Jesus and does not care for the wind and the waves on the sea.</P><P>The branches of the grapevine do not worry or strive. They do not have to rush here for sunshine or rush there for rain. They rest in the oneness and fellowship with the vine. At the right time, in the right way, the right fruits will be found. May we abide in the Lord in the same way.</P><P>We are saved not by striving, but by trusting in what Christ has done for us. Hence, our fruit-bearing is also an outflow of our trust in the work of the Savior within us.</P><P>In fruit-bearing, the question is not what you are or what you can do. "I am the true vine." After this, the crucial work of cultivation is in the unerring hands-"My Father is the husbandman" (John 15:1). He has turned our thoughts completely away from ourselves and has said assuringly, "Believe into God, believe also into Me" (14:1).</P><P>"I am the vine; you are the branches" (John 15:5). The branches cannot bear anything apart from the vine; they enjoy everything there is in the vine. This is the way we are in Christ, if we are indeed His fruit-bearing members.</P><P>"He makes me lie down" (Psa. 23:2). How precious is this word! Are we not aware that sometimes we are even too tired to lie down, too restless to receive the needed rest? But if He makes us rest, who can disturb us? If He makes us lie down, who can make us weary and cause us to worry?</P><P>Satan always tries to make us bear tomorrow's burden with today's grace. He tries to cause us to lose heart with the tribulations that are far off and to disobey the Lord's commandments. However, "Do not be anxious for tomorrow" (Matt. 6:34). "In nothing be anxious" (Phil. 4:6).</P><P>"The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (John 4:14). This word explains why those who partake of the water of life do not thirst anymore. The water of life becomes a spring that is available and gushes up from within the believers. Not only will they not thirst anymore, but they will overflow to supply man's need continuously.</P><P>"He who believes into Me, as the Scriptures said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" (John 7:38)-not trickles or summer torrents that afford a brief supply, but eternal rivers, rivers of life.</P><P>If our Lord works through the disciples and is not willing to work alone, how can we not join ourselves closely to Him and do His work in one accord? Our most blessed Lord has told us that He is the vine and we are the branches. Even if we have forgotten our oneness with Him, He will not forget it.</P><P>One thing that will help us is to concentrate on God's view toward Christian work. We should realize that God's work (which has nothing to do with man working for God) is God working in man.</P><P>Let us be clear whether we are putting God before our eyes. Are we walking on His way, and seeking to please Him and glorify Him in all things great or small? Those who do God's work and who walk on God's way will not lack God's supply.</P><P>Sometimes we may lament over the hardness of the unbelievers' hearts. Actually, we may be the ones who are hardened in heart, because we have not seen the soberness and reality of eternity.</P><P>The most callous and evil thing is to neglect the human body. How much more punishment is there for those who allow souls to perish? As Cain had said, "Am I my brother's keeper?" (Gen. 4:9).</P><P>Christ is the standard of the believers. Our love should be as broad as the love of Christ, and our faithfulness should be as narrow as the faithfulness of Christ.</P><P>Faith sees that God is greater than our sins, rather than our sins greater than God.</P><P>We should not work according to our self-strength; rather, we should seek for strength according to the work.</P><P>I want to see the Holy Spirit gaining all the freedom, and the flesh not having any freedom.</P><P>The more the Lord was faithful, the more He was despised and opposed. The more the Lord was gentle, the more He was dishonored. But none of these things changed Him, because the Lord did all things for God.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>EDITORIALS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 1</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN ANNOUNCEMENT<br>ON THE PUBLICATION OF THE CHRISTIAN</H2><P>Our Faith:We believe that the Bible is God's Word, word-for-word. We believe in a literal interpretation of all the major truths of the Bible.</P><P>Goal:In this little monthly publication, our desire is to supply spiritual milk to the young believers and solid food to the older ones. We especially stress the salvation of the cross. But we are even more concerned with the spiritual condition of the believers. We ask God to strengthen us that we could preach all of God's will. As to the errors of modernism, we will strive to warn God's children of its danger.</P><P>Standard:The Bible is our only standard. We are not afraid to preach the pure Word of the Bible, even if men oppose; but if it is not the Word of the Bible, we could never agree even if everyone approved of it.</P><P>Affiliation:We do not belong to any church. This paper is published with the help of the Lord's strength. Recently, being an indigenous church has become a fashionable subject. We believe that God's will is for us to return to the condition and method of the first century apostles. Therefore, concerning the question of the church, we preach with the New Testament as our goal, and we are not under the influence of any denominations.</P><P>Specialty:The odd issues of this publication (i.e., Issue Nos. 1, 3, 5, etc.) will be magazines, while the even issues will be Bible expositions. Many people do not understand the book of Revelation. Therefore, beginning with Issue Nos. 2, 4, 6, etc., we will devote ourselves exclusively to the study of Revelation. We will expound this book verse by verse. We believe that the readers will welcome this study. (There will be six magazine issues and six exposition issues each year.)</P><P>Price:Twelve issues per year for seventy cents. Overseas subscription is one dollar, or U.S. sixty cents, or two shillings, six pence. For eighteen issues (one and a half years), the price is one dollar. If you order ten copies, one will be free. Therefore, believers who are financially poor can solicit nine subscribers for this magazine and send in their subscription fee; they will then receive a copy free. Please use postal orders in sending in your payment.</P><P>Address:Bible Truth Depot, Pagoda Anchorage, Fukien.</P><P>Request:If we do not have your support, we will surely fail. Therefore, please withstand the enemy in your spirit on behalf of this paper. At the same time, please do your best to promote the circulation of this paper. Many people are willing to subscribe to the paper, but they think it too bothersome to do so. If you are willing to collect the subscription fee from them and send it to us, it will help us greatly. We hope that you will subscribe and introduce the paper to others today. May God bless all of you!</P><P></P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 2</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</H2><P>Since the first publication of The Christian, we have been so thankful for your unhesitating subscription, which increases the usefulness of this paper. There are more brothers and sisters who have helped this magazine by promoting it and collecting money for it. We do not have the time to thank you one by one, but we would like to thank you in a general way here. I know that you are doing this for the Lord's sake; however, since this magazine has received your benefit, we would nevertheless like to thank you. We hope that you would not forget this little work in your prayers. Pray to God for us that the editor would be healthy physically, that sinners would receive salvation through reading this paper, and that saints would be perfected through reading it as well. I still hope that you would not forget that the responsibility of increasing the usefulness of The Christian lies with you. You can write to believers within and outside your province, telling them of the publication of this magazine and asking them to subscribe to it and to introduce it to others. After the publication of the first issue, some friends wrote to tell us that the type is too small. We are aware that there are many unsatisfactory places in the first issue, but we have improved them in this issue. Now we have set the type less densely and have divided the page into two columns. I believe even those with weak eyesight can read it without much difficulty now.</P><P>This magazine has just started, and for various reasons we have to increase the price. Hence, beginning from next year, all new subscribers will be charged according to the new price, but those who have subscribed during this year will be charged the old price. We thank the Lord that many brothers and sisters who have subscribed during this year are willing to have the price adjusted to that of next year.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, since you have bought this magazine, I hope that you will not leave it on your shelf. What benefit is there, if a person only buys a magazine without reading it?</P><P>For the convenience of the readers, we have tried to put all the long articles into one issue. For some that are too long, however, we have to publish them in several issues. We hope that the readers will not give them up because of their length.</P><P>All the sections published in this issue are necessary knowledge for the study of Revelation. We hope that the readers will read it carefully.</P><P>We will continue with our format in the next issue. If you have any questions related to the Bible or spiritual life that you want us to answer, please send them to us within a few days of your receiving this magazine. Otherwise, we will not be able to answer them on time.</P><P>To those readers who have not paid their subscription yet, would you send in your money to the Gospel Book Room as soon as possible? This will help us greatly. All those who are subscribing to the paper should mark on their envelope the word "subscription," and all those who are writing to correspond with us should clearly mark the envelope also. I would love to correspond with God's children very much. However, if you want me to reply to you personally, please enclose a return envelope with stamps included. Overseas readers are free to do whatever they want to do.</P><P>Watchman, Foochow<br>November 26, 1925</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</H2><P>I am very sorry that due to the hurried publication of the second issue, many of the pages toward the end were not adequately proofread by me, so there were many errors. I would ask the readers to forgive us for this! In this issue we include an errata table. We hope that the readers will make the corrections according to the table and will thus not have any misunderstanding. </P><P>Except the articles that were written by the editor himself, all other articles are marked clearly with their source. Articles that are translated are marked "translated," and those that are quoted from other sources are marked "quotes." This will avoid any confusion. Some have wanted to know where the articles are from, and this will serve to explain their source. However, one thing should be clear: no matter from which window God's light comes into a dark room, the windows do not have to vie for glory or to boast. As long as light comes into the room, we are satisfied.</P><P>The Lord willing, the first article of every issue will concern the salvation of God. We hope that in the hand of unsaved ones, this paper will become a vessel to lead them to God. Those who are already saved would probably not be tired of reading about the salvation of the cross, for our eternal subject and memory in heaven will be the vicarious death of the Lord Jesus.</P><P>In this issue, we have an article by Mr. Henry concerning the church. Please pay attention to this article. At present, most papers that try to match the current of the age promote indigenous churches. They have all kinds of propositions. We are not here to insist on any opinions, but to learn to find out where God's will is and what His Word says. Other than God's Word (the Bible), we know of nothing else. Every one of us knows the unscripturalness of the distinction of sects. Furthermore, we are tired of the disputes that have come along with sectarianism. The only thing that we need to submit to is the teaching of the Bible. Besides this, we do not need to care for anything else. In the future, if there is anything that this paper will say about the church, it will be based on "Thus saith the Lord," not on anything else. If the readers can tolerate other papers' propositions of overthrowing the denominations and replacing them with indigenous churches, I hope that they can also tolerate this paper's propositions of a scriptural church. But then, what is the use of vain words? We know the truth in order to practice the truth. Hence, we hope that God's children would obey the Lord in the matter of the church. However, if unfortunately our minds are not the same, we hope this will not become a barrier between us.</P><P>The article on Genesis in this issue is very crucial. We hope that the readers will read it carefully with their Bibles open before them. In that article we explained the origin of Satan and the things of the first world. I should make a point of clarification here: The exposition of Ezekiel 28 in that article is done through much help from the famous English writer of the last generation, Mr. Pember.</P><P>All the subscribers' copies of this issue are sent out now. If you have not received yours, it is probably due to the unstable political condition of the times. Please write to us if you have not received yours, and we will send another copy to make up.</P><P>Friends, please do not forget to introduce our paper to others. It is not an easy thing to start a magazine. The reason we have done our best to publish it is that we want the truth to spread and to save and edify some people. We hope that you will have a share in this work and would do your best to introduce this paper to others. At present, we are not lacking in seekers for the truth. But they do not know about us and therefore have not subscribed to our magazine. I hope that you would at least introduce this paper to one other person this month, thus expanding the sphere of service of this paper to the saints. Thank you!</P><P>Watchman, Pagoda<br>December 12, 1925</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT</H2><P>Purpose:To cultivate the Christian's spirituality; to proclaim the salvation of the cross; to warn of the danger of modernism.</P><P>Content:Sermons, messages, research, talks, expositions, questions and answers. (Anyone desiring to ask questions about the Scriptures may do so.) Twelve issues per year, six of which are in magazine format, and six of which are on exposition.</P><P>Price:One dollar per year. Overseas $1.20. We do not accept orders for air mail. Please send us money by postal order, not by stamps.</P><P>Address:Gospel Book Room, Pagoda, Fukien.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT CONCERNING<br>THE GIVING AWAY OF BOOKS</H2><P>This work is very important. Of course, we should do our best to proclaim our beloved Lord and other truths with our mouth. But we cannot take hold of everyone to speak to him. For this reason, we should give away books. Do you know that giving books away produces the greatest results? Do you know that giving away a good book can lead others to receive the Lord, to understand the truth, and to forsake heresies? Unfortunately, those believers who are able would not do this work. Although we cannot know the result of giving books away, in that day when we stand before the judgment seat, we will see why it was worthwhile to do this work. We publish books, and you should buy and give away books.</P><P></P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</H2><P>This past month the Lord has been leading me through deep waters again. Although I have suffered Satan's attacks and have been sick in bed for a period of time, the Lord has caused this chain of hell to work to my advantage once again. I thank the Lord that He has not only healed me, but has taught me many lessons.</P><P>This issue has been ready for quite a while already. Therefore, questions that have come to me after the completion of this issue are not answered here and can only be answered in the seventh issue. In the future, we hope that questions regarding this column could be sent to us earlier, so that we do not have to postpone the answers to another issue.</P><P>From now on, the Lord willing, each issue of The Christian will contain a column on "The Signs of the Times" that our readers might better understand the situation in the last days and know how the prophecies of the Bible are being fulfilled step by step. May the Lord use this column to inspire His children to watch and pray and get themselves ready. Knowing that the Lord is coming soon should not make one lazy, but rather cause him to forsake the world. Those who are aware of the Lord's soon return, yet still love the world, are in a very pitiful spiritual condition.</P><P>The purpose of The Christian is not to preach any person, any man's ideals, or any "-ism." Its mission is to preach the Lord Jesus and Him crucified. We thank the Lord that this paper has aroused many people's sympathy and prayers. Our intention in these pages is to preach the message of the Lord to people far and near. I deeply believe that if the Lord's servants clearly preach the gospel of the vicarious death of the cross and depend on the mighty power of the Holy Spirit in order that sinners might become regenerated, they will by no means be fruitless. Unfortunately, what is preached today is not the gospel of God, the gospel of the grace of God. Rather, the message of the cross as revealed by God is replaced with man's ideals and rules for improvement. No wonder sinners are not affected. Others preach the salvation of God by their own intelligence and wisdom and do not have the Holy Spirit working with them by power. Hence, even though they preach, in the end they cannot save men's souls. I pray humbly that the Lord may have mercy on us and cause us not to rely on our own ability or strength but rather on God's Spirit to speak forth the gospel of the Lord.</P><P>Finally, I deeply feel that the work before us is very great. May the Lord be merciful to us and increase our strength. Brothers, please do not forget to pray for us.</P><P>While traveling in Muihwa<br>February 18, 1926</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 6</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</H2><P>I am writing this from Kulangsu, Amoy. The month before last, I was invited to work here in southern Fukien. But due to the fact that the next issue of the magazine was not yet ready and due to my physical weakness, I was not able to come. The week before last, in my prayer, the Lord showed me clearly that I should come. Hence, three days ago, I came here.</P><P>Now I am preaching the Lord's gospel to the students and the "nominal members" of the Gospel Hall. The impression I have here is the same as elsewhere: man always tries to be saved through his own good works! Although such ones always fail and know that they are not trustworthy, they still look to themselves and would not trust fully in God's grace! This is not strange to a fleshly person. What they see and think is not grace at all. They have never thought about God's love! The more I travel in my preaching itinerary the more I realize that everywhere, men need the gospel. We who have received His salvation should try our best to spread God's gospel of grace so that sinners, the ones who are incapable of doing any good and who know that they are hopeless, may believe and be saved. Our job is to preach clearly God's free grace in the power of the Holy Spirit so that many disappointed and downtrodden sinners may have the hope of salvation. Praise God that salvation has been accomplished!</P><P>This issue may be thinner than the previous issues. This is because the articles for the first column are finished, and I have left it open without filling in with something else. In addition, I had to travel. As a result, there were fewer pages.</P><P>From here, the Lord willing, I still want to go to Tungan, Changchow, and so forth. I hope that you would not forget to pray for me. The next two issues will probably have to be prepared while I am traveling. Please do not neglect praying for this matter.</P><P>We thank and praise our Father that the subscriptions for The Christian have been increasing day by day. I also thank many of my readers for their great effort in promoting this magazine. There are more and more modernists in the churches today, and there are several publications that are testifying for the truth. If you have not introduced this paper to others before, we request that you would spend a little time and energy today to do so. Introduce this magazine to your pastors, your church members, your classmates, and your friends that they may receive the service of The Christian also. May the Lord be with us.</P><P>Watchman, in Amoy<br>April 1</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</H2><P>I have been away for about two months, traveling in such places as Amoy, Kulangsu, Tungan, and Changchow, and have now returned home. Because of the weakness of my health, I was not able to finish this issue until the week before last. I would ask my readers to pardon me for the delay.</P><P>This time we have received more new subscriptions from southern Fukien, and we have sent out the magazines to them according to their order. If there is anyone who has paid but has not received their copy, please write to us to inform us so that we can forward the same to you. Many readers sent in seventy cents after January. According to the price, they will receive only eight issues. This is the seventh issue of this year already, and your subscription will be over after the next issue. If you want to continue the subscription, please send us the money so that we can continue the service. Otherwise, we will have to discontinue the mailing. Many people think that it is inconvenient to send money to us because the post office is not issuing postal money orders. Here is an alternate way. Those in places which do not take postal money orders can buy a cashiers check from a foreign bank, or they can spend five cents to send the money to us by mail. Of course, if postal money orders can be bought in your place, you do not need to do this. We hope that the readers whose subscriptions are about to expire will not delay and will send in the money orders right away to renew the subscriptions.</P><P>Our magazine has greatly increased in circulation within the last few months. At present, our Issue Nos. 3 and 4 are completely out, and the other issues have only a few hundred copies left. Those who want back issues should write to us right away.</P><P>Summer is about to come, and everywhere there are summer camps and other retreats. I hope that the readers of The Christian would take this opportunity to introduce this magazine to all the attendants so that this paper can serve more Christians. Furthermore, students everywhere are now being affected by the modernists, and they do not understand what salvation is. I hope that the pastors and teachers everywhere will introduce this paper to the students you know so that God will save and edify them through this magazine. Please do not forget to do it.</P><P>The synopsis of Revelation should have been published long ago. But due to my busy schedule, I could not put in the additional material that I wanted to put in, and the book is not yet published.</P><P>Finally, I fully realize that I am but a sinner saved by grace. My thoughts and my ways have many imperfections before the Lord. The one I hate the most is myself. O God, be merciful to this useless servant! Please pray for me so that wherever I go, I can walk according to God's will. Pray that God would lead me to do what I should do this summer. For now, my future is full of thorns, and I do not know what I should do in the way ahead of me. Please do not neglect remembering me before the Lord. The Lord willing, we will see you again next month.</P><P>Watchman, in Ma-Kiang</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 10</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</H2><P>In the summer I went to Anhwei to conduct meetings. On my way back I passed by Shanghai and got a heat stroke, which put me in bed for a few days. In my sickness I received the necessary lessons from God. Thank the Lord for His grace! When you receive this issue of the magazine, I will have left for work in southern Fukien already. May you not forget to pray for your weak brother.</P><P>The subscriptions of this paper have reached over 1,300. But our goal is far more than this. We hope that the readers will do their best to introduce it to others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE EDITOR</H2><P>While I was conducting meetings in Anhwei in the summer, some readers from southern Fukien wrote to change their address. The envelope was addressed to the editor, and the workers in the Gospel Book Room dared not open it. They transferred the letter to me in Anhwei. I had to then transfer the letter back to Fukien. It is a pity that such a small thing as a change of address brought about such delay in time and work. In the future, anything that has to do with publication matters should be directed to the Gospel Book Room and should not have my name on the envelope. As for matters related to the editor, please send to "The editor, The Christian magazine, Pagoda, Fukien." No matter where the editor is, someone will transfer the letter to me. Please do not forget to do this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CHRISTIAN</H2><P>This is the eleventh issue of The Christian. The next issue will be No. 12. After that issue, The Christian will have finished its whole year's work. We thank the Lord that He has blessed us during the past year to serve readers on time. We have often received letters from readers telling us how they have received help from The Christian. This does not make us proud. On the contrary, it humbles us to realize that God would use such insignificant vessels as we. Although our work is difficult, we are emboldened by the letters from you. May God bless both the editor and the readers!</P><P>The subscription period is about to expire! The important thing to do now is to renew the subscription. We ask those readers who have subscribed for only twelve issues to note that this is already the eleventh issue. The next issue will be your last issue. If you do not renew, we will stop mailing to you. You should not lose your friend, The Christian! We ask that you send in your money to renew your subscription the same day that you receive this issue so that you will not forget later.</P><P>The editor of this paper is seriously praying and considering how to improve the content of The Christian. He does not know if he should continue with the "Exposition Issues." If you have any suggestions, please mail to Mr. Nee directly for his reference.</P><P>A detailed list of our books is printed on the back cover of this paper. It is most convenient to order some books while you are renewing your subscription. Please remember! Do not forget to renew your subscription and buy the books.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 12</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE EDITOR OF THE CHRISTIAN<br>(PLEASE READ FIRST)</H2><P>Now is the end of a year. We confess that there were many shortages in our work this year. We ask that the Lord would forgive our failures, and we ask that you would pardon our oversights. We fully realize that we are nothing. If anyone has received salvation or has been helped or edified, may all the glory go to God the Father! We thank God that He has blessed us during this year so that in everything we see His hand. We thank Him even more for not despising our smallness, but He has used us, the humble vessels, to accomplish something for Him according to His plan. We praise Him because He has used this humble paper, The Christian, to remind and revive His own children. Even some sinners have been saved through reading The Christian. What more can we say? We can only give glory and honor to Him.</P><P>How solemn a work it is to be commissioned by God to expound His holy Word! When we think of this, we cannot help but stand in fear and awe. We are very willing to communicate to you through our pages the things that you have known, believed, and obeyed. However, our goal is not to please men, but to serve the Lord. If we are still pleasing men, how can we be considered the servants of God? If there is any word in this paper that has pricked your heart, please search the Scriptures before the Lord, trusting in His Holy Spirit, and consider how God would lead and teach you. Please forgive us for our zeal! We do this because we want to proclaim the whole counsel of God so that His children would fully obey Him. If not for this, are we not aware that we have to treasure man's friendship? But we thank God that most of our readers are sympathetic toward us. Most of the saints today love the truth, but not the whole truth. I hope that we will not be like this. We are reluctant to speak many serious words. But what else can we do when we know that this is God's commandment? Please forgive us for our forthrightness!</P><P>We believe that the day of the return of our Lord Jesus is near. But we do not know the date. Hence, we like to do more to awaken God's children. We have done this, but we will do more next year. The spiritual life of the saints is also very important. We wish to pay more attention to this point in the coming days, according to the strength that the Lord has provided us. As to the recent heresies, errors, and human traditions, we will surely issue the warnings according to the teaching of Jude 3. We desire that we will be able to say, as Paul did, that we have not held back anything that is profitable to you.</P><P>Finally, if the Lord delays His coming, and if He wants us to continue testifying for Him, we are very willing to serve all of you again next year. In lifting our eyes to the condition of today, we see that dusk is approaching and a storm is imminent. Who knows what the Lord's disciples will face? The present hours of vanity will soon be over, and the eternal glory is before our eyes. Let us consider more the Lord Jesus who has died for us!</P><P>December, 1926</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issues Nos. 13, 14</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHRISTIAN THIS YEAR</H2><P>We have entered another year of our work. Hence, we need to say a few words to the brothers and sisters in the big family of The Christian.</P><P>When we first began publication of The Christian, our original intention was to try it for only one year. While, on the one hand, there are not many spiritual publications today, on the other hand, there are enough to make us wonder whether there was sufficient need for us to publish The Christian. Yet, since its inception, readers everywhere have indicated that it does meet a great need in the church today and has its unique place. Their subscriptions, recommendations, and encouragements have been continually pouring in. We thank God that He has made The Christian so acceptable to His children. We intend therefore to continue the work for another year.</P><P>In publishing this little paper The Christian, in addition to difficulties with material, time, and energy, there is another problem that we feel reluctant to handle. The one thing that we fear the most is to be involved in debates. All of you know that in the present churches there are many theological arguments and variations in expositions. There are even more sectarian traditions and denominational systems. What we believe in and preach is nothing other than the Bible. We do not want to adopt anything from human tradition. But to adopt such a stand in publishing a paper will undoubtedly invite many debates and arguments. This is why during the past year, other than quoting directly from the Bible, we dared not discuss many things. Even when we made any conclusions, we dared not judge presumptuously, thus causing sorrow to those of God's children who hold different views than we do. At the beginning of this year, we would like to declare specifically that what we want to do the most is to proclaim to our readers the teachings in the Bible. But we want to proclaim them in the spirit of peace so that those brothers and sisters who hold different views will not be offended. St. Augustine said, "In primary things, be one; in secondary things, be liberal; and in all things, love."</P><P>When we published our first issue of The Christian, we included a statement stating our goal, standard, and affiliation. We would now like to reprint what we said then:</P><P>Goal: In this little monthly publication our desire is to supply spiritual milk to the young believers and solid food to the older ones. We especially stress the salvation of the cross. But we are even more concerned with the spiritual condition of the believers. We ask God to strengthen us that we could preach all of God's will. As to the errors of modernism, we will strive to warn God's children of its dangers.</P><P>Standard: The Bible is our only standard. We are not afraid to preach the pure Word of the Bible, even if men oppose; but if it is not the Word of the Bible, we could never agree even if everyone approved.</P><P>Affiliation: We are not affiliated with any church; rather, we publish this paper by the Lord's strengthening. Recently, indigenous churches have become a current topic of advocacy. But we feel that God's will is to bring us back to the conditions and ways of the first century's apostles. Therefore, with regard to the question of the church, we are specifically preaching it with the goal of the New Testament in view, and we are not controlled by any sect.</P><P>This statement was published in the first issue of this paper. By the grace of God we have not changed our original intention, and this year we will surely carry on according to this statement.</P><P>On the one hand, we desire to preach the true word of God, but on the other hand, we do not wish to hurt the good feelings of other children of God. Please remember that, though you may find some views in The Christian different from yours, we should never be divided because of this. This is even more so with regard to the question of sectarianism. We desire that all the children of God be united as one. Except for reason of extreme importance, we are most reluctant to publish any writings that would cause disputation.</P><P>According to the teaching of the Bible, all should discern when the prophets speak (1 Cor. 14:29). We believe that none of the world's best expositions were written under such inspiration as that of the Bible. Men invariably make mistakes. It cannot be that The Christian will never err. (Of course, we would never intentionally put errors into it.) However, if what The Christian teaches are teachings of the Bible and not teachings of men, nor of denominations, nor of theology, then please do not refuse them because of inconvenience. But if they are not the teachings of the Bible, please reject them. However, we must bear in mind this one thing: we should not annul the many "truly, truly's" in the Bible with one "perhaps," nor oppose the many clearly manifest teachings of the Scriptures with one or two ambiguous verses that are dependent entirely on interpretations.</P><P>In the November issue of last year, we have asked for suggestions from the readers concerning the "Exposition Issues" of this magazine. Many brothers and sisters have advised that we continue with it. We will quote one letter from Pastor Tsui Ai-kwang from Chen-yang-kwan, Anhwei:</P><P>"...Concerning the question of the `Exposition Issues,' I have found that I received more help from that than from the other issues. According to my personal experience, I think it should surely continue...."</P><P>This letter represents the desire of many readers. For this reason, this year we hope to continue publishing the "Exposition Issues." But for various reasons, we cannot publish six issues as we did last year. Most likely this year we will put out one issue per two months. While I am writing this, the section on Thyatira in the "Meditations on Revelation" is ready for printing.</P><P>The contents of The Christian this year will continue as before. Besides "The Signs of the Times," "Stories," and "Question and Answer Box," all of which were included last year, we have also prepared three articles on "The Paths to Hell" for this year's gospel messages (the first of which is published in this issue). Other articles which also proclaim the gospel of the grace of God will be published in succession. All our readers may feel free to pass on the gospel messages to others (whether or not you mention the name of this magazine). There is a certain pastor who regularly reads the gospel messages of this paper to his congregation on Sundays. He feels that even though they cannot hear our preaching personally, he still can use this direct method to meet the need. The Lord has greatly blessed what he has done.</P><P>This year there will be many messages especially dealing with faith in the "Spiritual Teachings" column. The articles on prayer by Mr. Meek will still be published. We also hope to print some practical articles written by other children of God. In the first half of this year, we intend to publish "Faith in Practice," "The Source of Faith," "Essentials and Nonessentials," "The Condescension of the Lord Jesus," "Bribing the Conscience," and others. "An Hour's Conversation with Mr. George Muller" has been translated by Mr. Wang Tze and will be published in the "Testimonies" column. The Lord willing, Mr. Wang will translate other articles for us. "A Sermon that Was Never Delivered" in the "Stories" column is the most touching one. We also hope to publish some testimonies of high school and college students this year. Please pay attention to them.</P><P>We have translated "The Origin of the Bible" and hope to publish it soon.</P><P>Concerning the exposition of the Bible, we will continue "Meditations on Genesis." However, each article will be a separate entity. The sixth and seventh articles have been completed. One is "The Story of Creation and the Truth concerning the Dispensations," and the other is "The Story of Creation and the Seven Great Characters of Genesis." Those who enjoy reading this column will receive much spiritual food.</P><P>Naturally, there is much which we cannot say now, but we will do our best to make The Christian a work which glorifies God and benefits men. We still ask you to continue praying for us so that in our work we can feel the power of your supplications. We still hope that you would not forget to introduce The Christian to others. You may think that this is an insignificant thing to do, but if everyone would do this, this paper will benefit much. May God bless our work this year. How happy we are when we consider that we can speak of His name to the world and to the saints for His sake!</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>January, 1927</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT<br>FOR THE CHRISTIAN</H2><P>This is to inform you that in order not to delay the publication of this issue of The Christian, we have combined the January and February issues, that is, Issue Nos. 13 and 14 into one issue. Many readers subscribed for twelve months last year. But we could not supply them the back Issues of Nos. 3 and 4 (now No. 6 is also out). As a result, we are adding two issues of this year to their subscription to make up twelve. This means that their subscription ends at Issue No. 14. Since this is Issue No. 13-14, their period of subscription ends after this issue. We ask that these readers would immediately renew their subscription so that we do not have to complicate our paperwork. If you subscribe early enough, you will not be cut off temporarily, and we will not have to wait and wonder if you still want it or not. According to our practice, once the period of subscription is over, we will stop mailing. We hope that you will help us in this matter. Moreover, our publishing address has moved from "Pagoda, Fukien," to "Shanghai." Hence, readers should direct their mail to "P.O. Box 323, Shanghai."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 17</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FEW WORDS TO THE READERS OF STRAIGHT PATHS</H2><P>Dear readers, we know that it is hard for a busy and uncalm mind to receive anything, and it is hard for a stubborn and prejudiced subjectivity to be without error. It is most easy for a heart that is not humble to breed negative feelings and criticisms when it encounters things contrary to itself. Therefore, when we read this special issue, the first thing we should pay attention to is our own attitude.</P><P>Straight Paths cannot solve all our problems regarding what we should know and should do. Yet at such a time when traditional teachings are kept most devoutly and organizations of human will are stressed most enthusiastically, Straight Paths can cause us to doubt these things and search them out in the Bible. The strictness in the Bible will never be "too much." The freedom in the Holy Spirit will never lead to "confusion." We do not need to be overly worried about these two matters. But our greatest shortcoming lies in our unwillingness to investigate, know, understand, and obey! After reading Straight Paths, we should investigate and consider much the Lord's words. We should also write down what is not clear to us and what seems contradictory, and we should ask directly for the guidance of the Holy Spirit and indirectly for the opinion of the Bible scholars, while always keeping a heart of prayer and obedience. The Lord will surely have something to teach us.</P><P>Anything that does not measure up to the truth must be destroyed. However, the purpose of destruction is to lead people to obey the truth, not to build up themselves. If we know that a certain matter is sin, we should break away from it first and should also lead others to break away from it. We should never condemn others with empty teachings and thus lose our love! Our Head is Christ. We, the many Christians, are merely the members. Through Christ, we have become one Body and are severally members one of another. The word of God is our light. All these are things that we already know. Therefore, after we have read Straight Paths, we should beware of following others, and we should also beware of others following us. The most important thing is to hold Christ the Lord as the center of everything and to take the scriptural teaching as the standard of all our conduct.</P><P>If something is not according to the scriptural teaching and cannot be accepted by our heart, of course we should investigate it again carefully. But if the teaching of the Bible is very clear, and our conscience acknowledges it as proper, yet because of ourselves and because of others, we have many considerations so that we become hesitant and negligent, eventually letting it pass away, then what more can we say!</P><P>During the long, long night, the one who most eagerly expects daybreak is the watchman. During this age of long, long night, are not we, the Christians, those who most eagerly expect the Lord's coming (parousia)? Dear readers, let us be watchful and prepare!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PREFACE TO STRAIGHT PATHS</H2><P>I remember after having been a believer for only one year, a friend gave me several spiritual books, one of which was Straight Paths. At that time when I read it, I found it incomprehensible in many places. I remember two points that helped me the most; one was concerning regeneration, and the other concerning the question of sectarianism. Although prior to this I was already regenerated in experience, yet there was still much darkness in my mind regarding what exactly is the whole matter of regeneration. This book clarified to me the meaning of regeneration.</P><P>I was originally a member of a big denomination. My grandfather was the first ordained Chinese pastor in my home town. I still remember my grandmother telling me that because my grandfather was the only pastor there, the three denominations in Fukien often took turns to borrow him! This book did not resolve for me any questions related to denominationalism, but it caused me to doubt the current organizational method of the denominations and to wonder whether these were all really scriptural.</P><P>As time passed, I completely forgot about this book. The second time I found this book was at the beginning of last year. I read it once again. How wonderful that what God has taught me and led me to consider and practice in these past few years really matched exactly what is described in this book.</P><P>At that time, I mailed some money to England to buy more than ten copies and gave them to my friends. At the same time I had the intention to translate this book into Chinese.</P><P>Last year I was sent by God to several places to preach the gospel. On my journey quite a few persons borrowed this book from me to read. They all thought this book should be translated into Chinese in order to help those who desire to wholly follow the Lord. But I really had no time for this. So it became a matter that was laid in God's hands.</P><P>At the end of the year when I was in Nanking, I lent this book to a sister. Thank the Lord, I did not make the request, but she volunteered and, together with another sister, successfully translated this book.</P><P>Because I see that the church of God today has fallen into a state in which it follows absolutely the tradition and opinion of man, I have often reminded the believers in this little paper, The Christian, concerning this matter. Of course, this kind of work has not been entirely fruitless, for some people's consciences have been aroused. (A hardened conscience is what I fear the most!) But I have my own difficulties also. It is not because I do not know God's teaching concerning this matter. The problem is my attitude toward my brothers. Every deep, thoughtful heart before God knows the difficulty of attacking teachings and conduct that are not according to the Bible. Unless God grants the grace, there is subconsciously a bitter taste against brothers who hold different views; sometimes ridicule may slip out of one's mouth. This is the problem on my side. On the other side, they are also my brothers. In every denomination today, as well as in organizations that resemble the denominations, there are many of my friends. Some of them I know well, and some I do not yet know. Their names often arouse in me respect and love. We all believe in one Savior, and we all serve one Lord. The precious blood and the Holy Spirit have already united us tightly, and we have become inseparable.</P><P>They are in the denominations, and they support the present form of the denominations. Though we do not hold the same view, I always believe that their intention is for the good. To doubt this is a sin. If I stand up to tear things down in a resolute way, inevitably it will cause problems among the brothers. This is what makes me sad.</P><P>But the word of God should not be buried. Why are we living on this earth? We should love the brothers, but such love should be controlled by the truth. My prayer was and still is that God would grant the grace to, on the one hand, witness for the truth concerning His church and, on the other hand, maintain a heart of brotherly love.</P><P>Ever since The Christian began this kind of open discussion, God has opened the eyes of a number of people. Is this not God's grace? Even some of those who bear the so-called responsibility in the churches are also seeking after the truth. The following are excerpts from two recent letters:</P><P>"The organizational method of the church today is really a sin of idolatry and fornication. The workers they employ are like Balaam who was hired by Balaak to work for him and who simply took orders from Balaak. But I am not very clear concerning the New Testament way. During this time of dramatic changes in foreign diplomacy, it is the right time to reform the church. Please show me in detail how to go on."</P><P>Another letter reads, "Since reading The Christian, I have been greatly helped by your teaching. But I am still not very clear concerning today's church system and organization, which you denounce. Therefore, I am writing to ask respectfully many questions that are in my heart. Please explain them for me in order to dispel my doubts. I shall be obliged." (Many questions followed.)</P><P>I am happy because the believers' consciences have already been awakened concerning this matter. John 7:17 really fits here. Today, many matters have fallen into a state of confusion. This is not due to the believers' lack of understanding, but to their disobedience. Many consider that even though the Bible has said something, it still cannot be done. This attitude renders the Lord's servants helpless.</P><P>Concerning the church, I deeply feel that only two things are indispensable: the Bible and the Holy Spirit. Man must discard all his "'however," "'but," "that will also do," "nothing has been said to forbid it," and obey the Bible. I have always wanted to ask peacefully those who advocate sectarianism, "Can you exhort others to obey the Bible's teaching concerning sectarianism?" Those who advocate sectarianism cannot exhort others to obey the Bible.</P><P>However, it is absolutely impossible to try to obey the command of the Bible without the power of the Holy Spirit. Those believers who have been taught by the denominations for a long time will feel that the biblical teaching concerning church organization is too "loose." Truly, if there is no Holy Spirit, everything will collapse! In the human organizations, everything is artificial; of course, when a person applies diligence, things will be booming. If the believers act according to the teaching of the Bible yet without the power of the Holy Spirit, they will see that their order will be worse than that of the human organizations. However, no fleshly order can substitute for the power of the Holy Spirit. Wherever the flesh is working, the Holy Spirit is not moving.</P><P>A believer in Amoy who read an original version of Straight Paths wrote us a letter saying:</P><P>"Straight Paths is needed urgently because the believers, though revived, do not know how to be baptized, how to leave the denominations, and how to establish the church according to the Bible. Brother, if you can devote one issue of The Christian to the church and publish Straight Paths in another issue, those who desire to establish churches will be able to learn from these issues. This would be wonderful."</P><P>In response to the need and requests from everywhere, we are now making Straight Paths a special issue of The Christian. In addition, we will print it as a separate book to make it widely available. I desire that Straight Paths will induce the readers to study the Bible and receive the teaching of the Bible directly. If Straight Paths and this magazine are taken by some as a set of charters or regulations for setting up churches, I would rather that this book not be printed. The Bible is the standard for all things. Do not follow men, and do not follow us.</P><P>The teaching of Straight Paths is outright and clear. Of course, there are many problems not yet covered. The Lord willing, perhaps in the future I will publish a more detailed book. I am most fearful, however, that a book will be taken by people as "a set of rules."</P><P>Finally, let me give a brief introduction of the author of Straight Paths. His name is Alexander M______. He is an evangelist greatly used by the Lord in Europe and America. He has been a prolific writer. One of his writings, "God's Wonderful Way of Salvation" has already been translated into Chinese (published by Holy Religious Books Society). Today he is already an old man. Though he cannot do any vigorous work anymore, his writings still continue to speak for him everywhere. In his books, he quoted copiously the words of others. All those he quoted were servants who have done fine work for God.</P><P>May 7, 1927<br>Watchman Nee, in Shanghai</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 20</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE<br>"WORSHIPPING GOD"</H2><P>Worship is an art that is long lost among Christians. There are very few people who know the meaning of the word worship. There are fewer who know how to worship God in spirit and reality. This is one reason for the degeneration of spiritual life among believers today.</P><P>The most important work in the spiritual life is to contact God and to fellowship with God individually. This contact and fellowship with God has its highest expression in worshipping God. It is when believers become mature in life that they know how to worship God as God. Another great reason for worshipping God is to worship Him for what He is to us.</P><P>Recently, the Lord has been pleased to see men in China preaching the importance of worshipping Him. This special issue that meets this timely demand should receive the greatest attention from the believers. May God guide those who are willing to be taught.</P><P>Watchman Nee</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LETTER FROM THE EDITOR TO THE READERS</H2><P>(The content of this letter describes the major changes for next year. We urge the readers to read this.)</P><P>When this issue reaches you, it will be the end of the year. Looking over the past year, we really thank Him for the way He has blessed us, led us, taught us, supplied us, urged us, healed us, rebuked us, chastened us, and disciplined us. Praise the Lord, Oh my heart! Again considering ourselves in this past year as being so defiled, defeated, head-strong (willful), rebellious, ungracious, unrighteous, lacking, and wrongful, we feel thoroughly discontented with ourselves. How we wish that these dark spots were not part of the history of our life. But wishing is wishing; still we are defeated. What a pity! Nevertheless, knowing our condition only convinces us more that our flesh is incurable and causes us to loudly sing praises to the Lord, for in such defeat He is still so gracious to us. O Lord! How can we forget Your grace?</P><P>It seems that my ill health during this past year was known far and wide. In three localities it was even rumored that my earthly tabernacle had been destroyed. For this reason there were increased prayers for me more than ever before. I greatly appreciate those who care for my physical welfare. In the past days my natural strength has been much weakened. Even light activity causes my body to feel its burden. But praise the Lord that this year was still filled with many days of work. Instead of resting and getting rusty, why not labor and trust? The strength of promise in time of need is never decreased. For this fact I cannot but praise the Lord.</P><P>The scarcity of fruit, the emptiness of life, the staleness of the spirit, and the weakness of the body are each enough to make me feel ashamed. Actually, I deserve nothing but to be ashamed. That all things work together for good to them that love God is true and trustworthy. In my situation these words again have become so real.</P><P>After a long period of waiting and praying, I am now clear about the Lord's will concerning The Christian for next year. When I first began publication of this paper, I knew it would not be of a permanent nature. At first I intended to publish it only on a trial basis for one year. Following the first year, I continued its publication for another year. Now two full years have passed. When I began, a few friends asked, "What is your purpose in publishing The Christian? What do you plan to do with The Present Testimony which you published before?" My answer was, "The goal of The Christian is to lead believers to read The Present Testimony. Whenever I feel the time has come, I will stop publishing The Christian." This was what I said to my friends then. Now the time has come, and The Christian will be discontinued.</P><P>This whole year I have been continually before God, contemplating and praying over the future of this paper. Day by day I have become clearer that the message of this paper is now adequate. God is now leading me on to bear another special testimony. As this instrument has been used in the hand of God, and as He now desires to put it aside, who am I that I should say no? Some friends who learned of my decision felt sorry that The Christian was being discontinued. Also, humanly speaking, it seems that since this paper is enjoying such a wide circulation, that it is a shame to discontinue it. According to my natural thought, I also am reluctant to discontinue The Christian, for I am most delighted with such a work. But God has stepped on the brake, and I must obey with rejoicing. In that day you will know that I was obeying God in this matter.</P><P>I feel deeply that the various testimonies we have printed in The Christian, especially those concerning the outward behavior of believers, are sufficient. If we continue our tiring reiteration, it will make The Christian a paper specializing in "leaving the denominations," "baptism by immersion," etc. I thank God that He gave the co-workers and me the same feeling concerning this matter. Some readers still have many questions that are still with me. I do not know now how the Lord wants me to spend my time. Therefore, I dare not promise to answer these questions. I had the thought once to put together the questions answered during the past two years plus the hundred or so questions I have at hand now and make them into a book for future reference. But I do not have the confidence that this is of the Lord. Hence, I can only wait.</P><P>As for those who have paid for more than we have published, we will send a separate letter to communicate with them. We hope that those readers will watch for such announcements. For those whose subscription will expire after this issue, we will not send additional letters to inform them anymore.</P><P>Does this mean that we will cease printing such writings concerning our testimony? The Lord is leading the believers meeting in Shanghai to publish The Present Testimony. Henceforth, The Present Testimony will be a written testimony of the believers who meet and have fellowship in Shanghai.</P><P>The Bible contains numerous teachings that ordinary believers cannot fully understand. Moreover, the testimony of the Lord is so incomparably great that we cannot receive and preach it completely. During the time of my waiting and praying, God committed to me the testimony which He wishes me personally to bear. I consider the book The Spiritual Man to be an outline of the special testimony which the Lord has committed to me. In the past years, day by day the hand of the Lord has become heavier upon me, forcing me to realize that He desires me to bear a special testimony for His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. There are many who have ordinary testimonies, but the Lord wants me to bear a special testimony for Him. Therefore, I am ready to give up the work of expounding the Scriptures, which thing I would like to do most, in order that I might bear the specific testimony that God has freshly committed to me. The wonderful thing about it is that the Lord is also leading all the brothers and sisters who are meeting and having fellowship in Shanghai in the same way. Hence, by means of the coming issues of The Present Testimony, according to what we have received from God, we shall specifically explain "the deep things of God" to the Body of Christ. We wholeheartedly desire to bear this unique testimony that the Lord has committed to us. We also fully realize that the Lord will raise up many other believers besides us to bear this testimony together. The more we walk on the spiritual path, the more we realize the importance of the message of the cross. Believers today have failed because they have not allowed the cross to work deeply and destroy all the works of the flesh. There is still a mixture of the new and the old creation in the lives of believers, because the old creation has not yet been replaced by God. Such mixture always results in loss to the new creation. Correctness in outward behavior, excellence in church organization, increase in Bible knowledge, and exertion in God's work are all insufficient to guarantee against a mixture of the flesh within. On the contrary, the flesh can act freely in all these things and promote them with all its might. For this reason, the work of the cross annihilating the old creation is indispensable. Without the cross standing between the new and the old creations, a person's spiritual life is false, shallow, and superficial. Since a believer's life is always related to both "self" and the Lord, the cross must destroy the self so that the Lord can have His legitimate place. The time of the millennium will be the right time for the Lord to overcome Satan. Therefore, by the grace of the Lord, we would remind the church of God that the Body of Christ must rise up to work with Him to bring in the kingdom. Our desire is that the enemy might soon be put to shame and that Christ might soon be glorified.</P><P>Because many believers today are limited by their financial means, we desire to see them receive the gospel without a price. In addition, the Lord Jesus' coming is near; if we have received subscription fees from others and we are raptured and no magazine is received by them, it will become an unsettled matter. Hence, we feel that it is better that we do not charge anything for this paper. For this reason, The Present Testimony will be completely free. The readers can support all publication needs according to their strength and the Lord's leading and help. In this way, those who have abundance among us will have a way to help those who are lacking. We ask that the Lord would loose the purse of the believers, and we at the same time ask the Lord not to allow the misers to send in their money.</P><P>It is almost the end of the year. Next year is now within sight. I once again am conscious of my own corruption, weakness, defilements, and my inability to meet the great responsibility that God has entrusted to me. At the same time, I am emboldened by His love, faithfulness, and wisdom, and I deeply realize that everything is His and that He bears all things. May God lead us on in His way.</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>December 10, 1927</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT CONCERNING<br>THE PRESENT TESTIMONY</H2><P>Subject:The Lord Jesus Christ (with special emphasis on His life, death, resurrection, supplications, His Body, His advent, and His kingdom).</P><P>Nature:Cultivating the spiritual life, rather than intellectual debates.</P><P>Period:The Lord willing, one issue per month.</P><P>Price:Completely free.

Booksellers often use advertisements to attract people to buy their books. Buyers are often cheated through oversight. Many booksellers have only one goal in mind, which is to make money. They sell all kinds of books, from those which are orthodox in their faith to those which are not. It is not uncommon for pastors and preachers to spend some of their savings to buy useless books. This is why we want to review books and magazines in this column honestly, fairly, and scripturally, so that the readers will know what to choose. [Editor's note: Following this is a list of magazines whose faith is unscriptural, a list of magazines whose faith is mixed, and a list of magazines whose faith is pure.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><P>In the last issue, we intended to publish a letter from Pastor Tsui Ai-kwang. Unfortunately, the letter was lost. What that letter said was mainly concerning the need for stern critical works on reviewing books and magazines in this age of apostasy. As for the reviews made in the issues prior to the last one, they were all done by the editor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PERSONAL WAY TO BE SAVED</H2><P>A few years ago, when I was a one-year-old believer, I obtained this book in English and received much help from it. Two years ago, I heard that it was translated into Chinese, but did not know who the publisher was and could not secure a copy for myself. Although this book is small, it contains many practical points. It also contains many moving stories. Chapter seven on prayer is the most valuable article. The author of the book is the founder of a certain group in England. The group is not a church, but an organization established solely for the salvation of souls. The method the group uses is to write down in notebooks names of friends and relatives according to the leading of the Spirit and to pray for them. At the same time, the gospel would be shared with them until one by one they are saved. When I first became a Christian, other than The Pilgrim's Progress, this book rendered me the most help.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF GOD</H2><P>Writer: Scofield. Publisher: Morning Star Publisher, Chefoo. Price: Five cents. This book is a popular booklet among Western spiritual believers. The greatest problem with modern Bible expositions is that men do not rightly divide the teachings in the Bible. Instead, they mix up the teachings of various biblical dispensations, such as those for the Jews and those for the church, and those concerning grace and those concerning the law. In this book Dr. Scofield made clear distinctions between the different teachings. Those believers who want to study the Bible without confusion should study this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AND SOCIAL REFORM</H2><P>Writer:______. Translator:______. Price: Sixty cents. The first point about this book is that it is too expensive. A book with so-called social reform in its title is enough to make a person who firmly believes in the Bible sick at heart. Those in the Young Men's Association group talk daily about social reforms. But what I want to know is how many societies they have reformed. As long as the Christian church is here, it proves that the world cannot be reformed. If society can be reformed, then the Lord would have reformed it already. Why is there still the need for the church to be established? (The word church in the original language means "the called-out ones." If society can be reformed, one can live inside it; what need is there to be called out?) The writer wrote on page 10 about "the ideal society according to Jesus." I do not know if the Lord Jesus showed one time what an ideal society should be. The writer is a person who does not believe in the vicarious death of the Lord Jesus for sinners. He considers that the Lord Jesus only "sacrificed for His teaching," "was martyred for His teaching," and gave Himself to a "risky endeavor" (p. 20). More absurd than this is his assertion that the gospel that the Lord Jesus proclaimed was merely a "philosophy" (p. 22). He thought that when the ideal society of the Lord Jesus would appear, all the good things would happen. Later, he said that "such a world would be paradise indeed" (p. 22). Can the world become a paradise through certain kinds of philosophies? We know that the Bible never intends to reform the world. God's intention in this age is to select men out of this world for His name (Acts 15:14). He is not selecting the whole of humanity. In expounding the story of the rich man and Lazarus, the writer said, "The uneven distribution of wealth between the rich and the poor..filled Jesus with righteous indignation! Probably He thought He could change this" (p. 26). Fortunately, he used the word probably! The Lord Jesus never considered the uneven distribution of wealth between the rich and the poor as something that could be changed. The rich man was still rich at the time he died! And Lazarus was still poor at the time he died! If there was any change at all, it was after they had died! Yet even after they had died, there was still the distinction --Lazarus was still not with the rich man in the same place! In talking about social struggles, the writer quoted 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, 17-22. But I do not know how these verses can have anything to do with the social struggles that the writer talked about. On page 39 the writer talked about the "kingdom of heaven"; then on page 112 he explained the meaning of the "kingdom of heaven." The kingdom of heaven to him is just the ideal society of the Lord Jesus. He does not recognize the existence of a real kingdom and is the same as all the other modernists. On page 115 he said, "The new citizens are those who can build up Jesus' promised kingdom of heaven." That means they do not necessarily have to be saved Christians! Page 34 talks about how these new citizens come about; they come about through regeneration. "Jesus called regeneration the rejuvenating experience of confessing oneself to be a child and responding to the love of God." Is this the regeneration that the Bible talks about? Can one be regenerated just by "confessing oneself to be a child"? The reason there is regeneration is that the "self" is unreliable. Can one be regenerated without the bearing of sins on the cross? The writer did not recognize the total depravity of humanity either. "According to Jesus' teaching, everyone has a good nature within him and has the ability to do good" (p. 170). He just said this capriciously and could not quote one verse to back him up. We do not know how the writer would explain John 3:6. Can those born of the flesh evolve into a spirit? The Lord Jesus thinks that it is impossible, that there is no goodness in man. On page 183 the writer mentioned the death of the Lord Jesus as "a martyrdom," and not an act of redemption. The translation of this book is very fluent. If a reader has the intention to study sociology, he will be impressed by the beauty of the style and will recognize the Lord Jesus as the best social reformer. But this book is completely useless, even harmful, to the salvation of the soul and to leading others to believe in the Lord as their Savior. After reading this book, I was amazed by one thing: the writer only called Christ as "Jesus"; he did not call Him "Lord Jesus." The Judas of old and this writer today are of the same category. "No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRUTH AND LIFE</H2><P>Bi-monthly. One dollar per year. This bi-monthly magazine is a combination of the famous modernistic Life Monthly and Weekly Truth magazines. This magazine continues with the purpose of the two previous papers. Although the name of it is Truth and Life, I am afraid that what it gives to others is only "Error and Death." Most of its articles have a critical attitude toward the Old Testament, and they are concerned merely with social issues. It has nothing to meet men's spiritual needs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 8</H2><P>(This magazine is only responsible for the books that it considers good; we are not responsible for all the other books published by the same publishers that are not reviewed by this magazine. Do not think that just because one book is good, all the books published by the same publisher are also good.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE PUBLICATION<br>OF THE SMALL VOICE MAGAZINE</H2><P>Free. Address:______. This is a non-periodic publication. All those who want a copy of it can ask for a copy from the correspondence address. This paper is published by a few saints who love the Lord around the Shangtung area. Its goal is: "to remind the church to forsake worldliness and to guard against the teaching of modernism, so that believers would not be shaken by all unscriptural teachings and drift away from their original faith; to encourage men to advance in doctrine, in heart, and in spiritual life through keeping the will of God." Its purpose is: "specifically given to the preaching of the genuine voice of God, the gospel of salvation, the soon coming of the Lord Jesus, the expounding of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, the Savior of all mankind, and the Christ." We thank and praise the Lord that in this dark and apostate age, there is another paper for the Lord's testimony. I truly hope that those brothers and sisters who are rich in faith and material goods will follow the Lord's leading to work with this paper and to help its advance. Concerning the goal of this paper, I would humbly and gently say a few words. The church is a congregation called out of this world already. Unfortunately, the present church is no longer the church, and I say this with a sorrowful heart. Hence, there is this need "to remind the church to forsake worldliness." However, according to the prophecies in the Bible, it will be the remnant of God in the church who will forsake worldliness and human organizations and who will cleave unto the Lord. There is no such thing as "the church forsaking worldliness"! Both the world and the church will become progressively worse day by day. Hence, dear brothers and sisters in the Lord, if you see the church not forsaking worldliness, but rather rejecting the Lord's Word, do not be disappointed. Finally, I pray that God would bless the Small Voice magazine, the Spiritual Light magazine, the Bible magazine, the Revival magazine, the Morning Star magazine, and the Lamp to My Feet magazine. May the Lord bless them, and may the Lord bless The Christian!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SPIRITUAL COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS</H2><P>Twenty cents. This book was translated from English. The translation is average. The writer has provided a number of helpful points concerning the interpretation of the book. After reading the book, the reader will have a clearer outline concerning the book of Galatians. The most difficult portion in the whole book of Galatians is 3:15-20.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 9</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>BRIEF PROOFS CONCERNING THE BIBLE</H2><P>By Dr. Torrey. The outline of this book was published in the Lecture Notes of the Encouragement Society last year. Dr. Torrey has already given this lecture in many nations and has helped the faith of many people. Dr. Torrey was able to use the simplest language to explain the deepest truth. In this book, he presented the Bible as the Word of God in a brief way. Those who are unprejudiced will find the truth in this book.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 12</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INTRODUCING DR. SCOFIELD'S<br>BIBLE CORRESPONDENCE COURSE</H2><P>Dr. Scofield was an American Bible teacher greatly used by the Lord. He inherited the riches from great Bible scholars, such as Darby, Kelley, and Grant, and digested their writings to put together this systematic course. He has, indeed, produced the consummation of Bible scholarship! He has even developed and carried their teaching further.</P><P>This Bible correspondence course can be considered the most complete correspondence course there is in the whole world. What is contained there is not only what Dr. Scofield had received during his lifetime, but it is the culmination of the writings of God's teachers of the truth, men such as Darby, and so forth. Dr. Scofield passed away four years ago. But I believe that "though he has died, he still speaks." We are very happy that many of our teachings take the same stand and hold the same view as Dr. Scofield. Now this course has gradually been translated into Chinese, and in February of 1927 the course will begin in Nanking. We introduce this course to our readers with much recommendation. Finally, a word of warning: any magazine or Bible correspondence course can only lead us to the springs of living water; they are not the springs of living water themselves. To study many books and courses about the Bible without studying the Bible itself is a great danger!</P><P>Those who are interested in applications to this Bible correspondence course should write a post card to "The Scofield Bible Correspondence Course, Han-si-men Orphanage, Nanking," and you will receive detailed instructions on enrollment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>STUDY ON THE BOOK OF JONAH</H2><P>Ten cents. This book was written by a British teacher. Its clarity in exposition and depth of knowledge has been welcomed by most Bible-believing men. In an age when the modernists have greatly criticized the historical value of the book of Jonah, this author boldly proved the story of Jonah as a history and not an allegory. This book is knowledgeable and contains much spiritual insight. The translation is not bad. It is a suitable book to give to those seminary students who are deceived.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 20</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>GUIDELINES FOR TEACHING THE BIBLE</H2><P>Writer:______. Fifty cents. This is an instruction manual based on psychology for those teaching Bible classes in schools. We find many suggestions in the book interesting and valuable. But we cannot fail to find one great mistake and disastrous lack in the book! The Christianity described in this book is only one which teaches men to behave according to Christian principles. It is not concerned with regeneration, the receiving of a new life by a sinner. Like all other modernist books, this book does not offer a gospel to sinners. Instead, it only leads men to receive some Christian ethics and moral laws. This is again the arguments of the Young Men's Association. We often ask these ones: "If Christ is superior to others only in His moral and ethical teachings, why do we have to lead others to believe in Him? There are so many people in this world who talk about ethics and morality already!" What sinners need is the gospel, a gospel that will save them, and not better examples.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>INTRODUCING DR. SCOFIELD'S<br>BIBLE CORRESPONDENCE COURSE</H2><P>Since the inception of this Bible correspondence course at the beginning of this year, over one hundred sixty students have enrolled for the course. Many readers of this paper have enrolled themselves in this course, but I myself wish there could be more readers who would enroll in it. Scofield's correspondence course can be considered the most complete for those seeking foundational knowledge of the Bible. If a believer receives the foundational help from Scofield, he will be able to do deeper research on the Bible at a later date. At this juncture, while this paper is being suspended, I would take this opportunity to remind all to pay attention to this matter. Of course, if we study merely with our mind, the harm of reading the Bible is no less than anything else. This is something that we should be careful of. Detailed instructions for enrollment can be obtained from Mr. Chen Chi-kwei in ______, Nanking.</P><P>Watchman Nee</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A LIST OF THE TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR<br>THE CHRISTIAN</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>(According to the Sequence<br>of the Original Volumes)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Articles not by Watchman Nee are marked with ***)</H2><div class="bd">Issue No. 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
