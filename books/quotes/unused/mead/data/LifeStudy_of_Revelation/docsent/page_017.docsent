   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Seven Eyes of the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb 5:6; Zech 3:9; 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our eyes are for our moving.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we are blind, it is very difficult to move.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In God s move today, Christ as the Lamb of God has seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The seven eyes of the Lamb are also for watching, observing, and transfusing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I look at someone, something of me is transfused into him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We often talk about loving one another, but how can you realize that someone loves you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Love is transfused through the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you look at me in a loving way, your eyes will transfuse your love into me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Christ looks at us with His seven eyes, we may be terrified at first.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, however, these seven eyes will transfuse Christ s element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Holy Spirit today is the seven eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians argue that the Holy Spirit of God is separate from Christ, but the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you think of your eyes as being separate from you?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is ridiculous to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I look at your eyes, I look at you, and when you look at me with your eyes, you look at me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The eyes of a person express that person.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To say that the Holy Spirit is separate from Christ does not correspond with the pure revelation of the Holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How can we say that a person s eyes are separate from the person himself?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no room to argue about this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen that the Bible says that the Spirit of God today is the eyes of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This simply means that the Spirit is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My eyes are me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I look at you, my eyes look at you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I had no eyes, I could never look at you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the Spirit, the eyes of Christ, is not separate from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the eyes of Christ looking at us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our experience proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Day by day, we sense that Someone is looking at us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This Someone is the Spirit, who is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Spirit were not Christ, we would sense that two, the Spirit and Christ, were looking at us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say that the Spirit is separate from Christ is to pluck out the eyes of Christ and to separate them from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not scriptural to say that the Spirit is separate from Christ and that Christ is not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as we and our eyes are one, so Christ and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our Christ is not a blind Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the Christ with the seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Often, He transfuses His element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At other times, He observes us like a flashlight, saying, What are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Are you fighting with your husband?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Stop!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Have you not had this kind of experience?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Day by day we experience this watching, observing, and transfusing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This watching, observing, and transfusing take place through His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His eyes are the Spirit, and the Spirit is simply Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you do not believe it, you will miss the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>C. The Seven Lamps of Fire</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>before the Throne of God</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The seven eyes are also the seven lamps of fire before the throne of God 4:5; Zech 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ carries out God s administration by the shining of the seven lamps of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is true in the churches today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Christ looks at and through us, He shines upon us and executes God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many times as the elders in the churches are discussing matters with one another, they have the sense that the seven lamps of fire are shining upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is Christ s carrying out of God s administration through the shining of the seven lamps of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>D. Sent Forth into All the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The seven Spirits of God have been sent forth into all the earth 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Wherever we go, the seven eyes will follow us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In fact, they will go before us and be waiting for us at our destination.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many dear saints who are unhappy with the church in a certain locality have moved to another locality, thinking that it would be much better for them in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But when they arrived at their new locality, they found that the Spirit was waiting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some of us have gone places where we should not have gone, and when we arrived there, we were greeted by the Spirit, who said, Go back.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Don t stay here.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today the Spirit has been sent forth into all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He now pervades every corner of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the wonderful Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
