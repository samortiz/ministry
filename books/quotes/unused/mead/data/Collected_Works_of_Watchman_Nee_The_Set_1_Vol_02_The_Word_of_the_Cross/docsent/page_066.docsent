   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON SIXTEEN JUSTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The meaning of justification is deeper than the meaning of forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Forgiveness of sins means that even though we have sinned, God has forgiven our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Justification means that God not only forgives our sins, but also justifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Forgiveness of sins is like the general amnesty in ancient China, when all the criminals were pardoned.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Justification is like a declaration of "not guilty" by the court and is more than just forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus is justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not only believe that each one of us has been justified by God, but we should also always have the boldness of justification to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes we may be weak and we may stumble, fail, or sin, yet we are still justified by God; our justification will not change because of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After justification, we cannot be more justified through good works or less justified through evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since justification is not obtained through works, it will not be lost through works.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No matter what our condition is, we have the right to believe that every day we are justified by God through the Lord Jesus' merit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God accepts those who believe in Christ, just as He accepts Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Believers are justified by the Lord of the heavens and the earth: "It is God who justifies" Rom 8:33 Grace is the source of justification: "By His grace" Rom 3:24 "By grace you have been saved" Eph 2:8 "Having been justified by His grace" Titus 3:7 Justification is based upon the obedience of Christ: "Through the obedience of the One" Rom 5:19 "Becoming obedient even unto death" Phil 2:8 The price of justification is the precious blood of Christ: "In His blood" Rom 5:9 "Through His blood" Eph 1:7 Justification is gained by faith: "Out of faith" Rom 5:1 "Through faith in Jesus Christ" Gal 2:16 "Everyone who believes" Acts 13:39 The proof of justification is the resurrection of Christ: "Was raised for our justification" Rom 4:25 "Having been raised from the dead" Rom 6:6-9 "Raised us up together" Eph 2:6 The result of justification is good works: "Faith without its works is useless" James 2:20-26 "Let your light shine before men" Matt 5:16 "Zealous of good works" Titus 2:14 "Be careful to maintain respectable works" Titus 3:8 "For good works...that we would walk in them" Eph 2:10</S>
