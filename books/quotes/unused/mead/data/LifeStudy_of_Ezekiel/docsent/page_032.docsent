   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASIS OF COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The basis of the coordination of the living creatures has a number of aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All Being out of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The basis of our coordination as living creatures is, first, that we all are out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You are out of Christ and I am out of Christ; therefore, we can coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By His blood the Lord has purchased us for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation Rev 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No matter what our race or nationality may be, we all are out of Christ and we can coordinate together as one entity in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we were not of Christ and if we were not in Christ, we could not coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But although in Adam we have many differences, in Christ we can be blended together and we can coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Having the Same Life</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not only out of Christ we also have the same life, the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Outwardly we are quite different, but inwardly we all have Christ as our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, we have the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1933 I visited some Japanese brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I could not understand Japanese, and they could not understand Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, when we knelt down to pray together, we had a sense of freshness and sweetness in our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that we, the living creatures, all are out of Christ and that we all have the same life, the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we reject everything that is not Christ, we will be one entity in Christ and we will be able to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having the Same Heart to Express Christ</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Another aspect of the basis of coordination is having the same heart s desire to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Deep within many believers, including those who have fallen away from Him, is the desire to express Christ and glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To glorify the Lord, to express Him, is to live Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a genuine living creature, every Christian who has experienced the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum has such a desire to express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The basis of our coordination is that we are out of Christ, that we have the life of Christ, and that we wish to glorify Christ and express Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now, because of this, we can coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A proverb says, Birds of a feather flock together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since we all are out of Christ and have the same life and the same desire to express Christ, we are birds of a feather and we flock together to become one entity in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the basis of our coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE NECESSITY OF COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I hope that every believer will understand the we cannot be Christians in isolation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Basically, as believers in Christ we are a collective entity, and we cannot do anything alone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The vision in Ezekiel 1 shows us that we need to be corporate and that we need to be in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Necessary for God s Expression</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Coordination is necessary for God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have pointed out that the four living creatures are for God s expression in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for God to have a corporate expression of Himself in Christ, we need to be joined together and knit together with all the saints and thereby become one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we are isolated, we cannot express Christ adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Each of the living creatures has four faces.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, if we were to look at the living creatures one by one, we could not see all four faces at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only when the living creatures are coordinated together can we see all four faces simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that as individual believers we cannot express Christ completely and adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the corporate expression of Christ, we need to be joined together, knit together, and coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Necessary for God s Move</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Coordination is also necessary for God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The spreading of the gospel of God, the advancement of God s move on earth, the execution of God s will, the progress of the church of God all this requires coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is impossible for us to accomplish these things as individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Through our experience in serving the Lord, we have learned that coordination is necessary for every aspect of God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The great wheel of God moves according to the coordination of the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Necessary for God s Administration</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, coordination is necessary for God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Ezekiel 1 the throne of God s administration is upheld not by any individual living creature but by the coordination of all four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, coordination is necessary for God s expression, God s move, and God s administration.</S>
