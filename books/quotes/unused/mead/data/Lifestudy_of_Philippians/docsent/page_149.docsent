   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FIFTY THE SACRIFICE OF YOUR FAITH Scripture Reading: Phil 2:17-18; 1:25; 3:9; Eph 1:13; 2:8; 3:17; Gal 2:20; 5:6; Col 1:3-4; 2:12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:17 Paul says, But if even I am poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith, I rejoice and rejoice together with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse Paul speaks of the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith, a phrase which is difficult for students of the Bible to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here two matters are related to the believers faith: the sacrifice and the priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul regards the believers faith as a sacrifice offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The priestly service refers to the offering of sacrifices by a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse Paul seems to be saying, Philippians, I consider your faith as a sacrifice offered to God, and my offering of this sacrifice to Him is a priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this message we shall consider the sacrifice of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We shall not cover the matter of priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the book of Philippians Paul uses certain extraordinary expressions such as the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ 1:19 , holding forth the word of life 2:16 , and the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would know the secret of experiencing Christ as revealed in this book, we need to understand these expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FAITH AS A SACRIFICE OFFERED TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the faith that can constitute a sacrifice offered to God?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As believers, we all have some amount of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we did not have faith, we could not be believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we have faith, the question remains whether or not this faith can be regarded as a sacrifice offered to God in a joyful way by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul was a New Testament priest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He says in Romans 15:16, That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a gospel priest, Paul offered his converts to God as a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Philippians 2:17 it is not the believers themselves which are the sacrifice; it is the faith of the believers which is considered a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The thought in 2:17 is deeper than that in Romans 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you think of your faith as a sacrifice which such a ministering one can offer to God?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to verse 17, Paul was willing to be poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and priestly service of the believers faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul realized that one day he would be martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a martyr, he would be a drink offering poured out upon the sacrifice of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Old Testament a drink offering was poured out on one of the basic offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without a basic offering, there could not have been the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul regarded his death as a martyr as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The basic offering upon which this drink offering was to be poured was the faith of the believers in Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is very important for us to understand what kind of faith can become the sacrifice on which the drink offering is poured.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, in this message we shall seek to understand the faith to which Paul refers in 2:17.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>FAITH, THE WORD, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The faith in this verse is somewhat different from that mentioned elsewhere in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 1:13 says, In whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result of hearing the word of the truth and of believing in Christ, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this verse we have the word, faith, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By hearing the word and believing it, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word, faith, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Word is the expression of God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is the source of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we have the Word, we have God, for the Word is God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the Gospel of John, the Word is both God and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, Christ is also God, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is the Word, and the Word is God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, there is a marvelous interrelationship between God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Word is God and also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the same time Christ is both God and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, Christ is the Word; on the other hand, the Word is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Likewise, God is the Spirit and the Spirit is God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we see the Triune God embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Triune God is embodied in the Word, and the Word has come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The very Word which was with God and which is God became flesh and tabernacled among us John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to John 20, this Word who became flesh was worshipped as God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thomas said concerning Him, My Lord and my God John 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Word is not only our God, but also the coming of our God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our God comes to us embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, according to Ephesians 6:17, the Spirit is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The wonderful Triune God is embodied in the Word, and the Word has come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Word comes, God, Christ, and the Spirit come.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Three of the Triune God come with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first function of the Word is to infuse us with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not believe it is possible for someone to repeat a Bible verse ten times without being infused with faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Suppose an atheist reads John 3:16 and repeats this verse again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even this atheist would be infused with faith through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The faith infused into us through the Word is the function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Faith is both the issue of the Word and the function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the Word comes to us and is contacted by us, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This means that when the Word reaches us and we touch it, the Word becomes the Spirit in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, the Word first comes to us and then it becomes the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Word becoming the Spirit in our experience can be illustrated by the lighting of a match.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The head of a match is a ball made of phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we strike a match in a proper way, the phosphorus bursts into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Is the flame different from the phosphorus?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No, it is simply the explosion of the phosphorus.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In like manner, the Spirit is the explosion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we experience this explosion, we are burned by the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This burning is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As a young Christian, I earnestly desired to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I read a number of books about faith.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, none of these books told me what faith is in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only in recent years have I discovered through my experience what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Faith comes out of the word that infuses us with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hence, faith is the issue of the word and of the Spirit s function.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we have the word with the Spirit, we spontaneously have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As we have pointed out, faith, the word, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you consider this definition of faith in the presence of the Lord, you will worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You will see that whenever there is genuine faith in you, the word is implied and the Spirit is realized.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Apart from the word and the Spirit, it is impossible for us to have faith.</S>
