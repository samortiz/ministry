These messages speak of what the church is and has the building of the church and the coordination order and authority of the Body of Christ
We have an unprecedented burden that we would see the Lord's purpose for the church according to His further move
When God enters into man and is united with man as one, man can be His expression and can represent His authority
Only when man is willing to allow God to enter into him to be his life will God's image and authority be manifested in man
In relation to the creation of man, Genesis 1 speaks first of image, then of authority, and finally of multiplication
Some may ask, 'If God wanted to gain millions of people, why did He not simply create millions of people instead of one man?
Outwardly, a family may seem to have many people, but in a normal situation, others can sense that the 'many people' are one
In a large Chinese family five generations can live together under the same roof, but others can sense that they are one
They have one family name, one source, one language, one disposition, and even one kind of living and habit; they have one life within them
In the same way, God does not want man only to have His image and authority, but He wants man also to become a corporate man
Only such a man can be God's expression and God's representative; only a corporate man can be like God and reign for God
When we rise up to pursue the Lord, we often have a concept that we hope to be like God and reign for God individually
God has no way to accomplish His purpose without man, but unless this man is a corporate man, God still cannot fulfill His intention
If we have spiritual insight, we will see that in the garden of Eden Adam was not an individual man; he was a corporate man
Creation prepared the material and laid the foundation for the completion of God's work to fulfill His purpose
The Bible reveals that God created man with three parts-spirit, soul, and body; in this way we are different from all other creatures
God's purpose is to enter into us so that we may have His image to express Him and His authority to deal with His enemy
God created man with a body so that through this body there would be a framework, an appearance, and an expression
We see the body of a person and become acquainted with him through his build, appearance, demeanor, and actions
The Bible says that consecration is to present our body and that we should glorify and express God in our body
Take a look at all the living creatures on earth; there are millions of creatures, yet man is the most capable
Man dominates the earth today because man has a personality, is living, and has a will, ideas, preferences, and thoughts
There is not one person who is unable to know the things of God, because God created man so that man could know Him
Animals, such as cats, dogs, cows, and sheep, cannot know the things of God, but man can know the things of God
Although it is difficult to know the things of God from the spiritual side, man nevertheless has the capacity to know the things of God
We need to remember that God created a soul for man so that man would have a personality to match and complement God
After creating all things, God felt that it was not good to be alone, yet He could not find a counterpart in the universe
The most uncivilized, uneducated, and ignorant person, or the most corrupt and extreme atheist, can respond to the gospel
Regardless of how much we may speak to a table, it will not respond, because our speaking cannot enter into it
Our speaking can enter into a microphone because a microphone is designed with special devices to receive our voice
When electrical current flows in and through a filament, light is emitted, and through the bulb on the exterior this light is expressed
He created us with a soul so that we may choose Him, desire Him, love Him, meditate on Him, and comprehend Him
The creation of man was God's first step; it was merely the preparation for fulfilling His purpose, not the completion
In John 1224 the Lord said Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
At this point authority has come to the church, which is not many individual men but one corporate entity, one Body
We can say that there is still one final step in relation to the work of God, the manifestation of the holy city, New Jerusalem
All who know the Bible know that the manifestation of the holy city is not something God will do apart from the church
In the same way, when God's authority is established in those who are saved, a city will appear, and that city will be the New Jerusalem
May God have mercy on us to see that the church is a corporate man, a corporate expression, one bread, one Body
For two thousand years Satan has been working to divide God's children, to tear down the Body of Christ, causing it to be fragmented
The members who have not been divided by Satan have been damaged by him to the point that they have lost their function
May the Lord be gracious to us so that our eyes may be opened to see Satan's schemes and to fight to the end for God's eternal will
We should pay special attention to the fact that the Lord spoke of the church in the Gospel of Matthew, which is the gospel on the kingdom
The authority of the church does not belong to the apostles individually; the authority of the church belongs to the church corporately
In Genesis 1 God's authority was entrusted to a man; however, in the Gospel of Matthew authority was entrusted to the church
The church is entrusted with God's dominion; it is also the place where God's authority is linked to heaven and exercised on the earth
The real preaching of the gospel is our bringing God's authority to every man, every place, every family, and every group of people
According to the order in Genesis image is first and then authority however in the New Testament authority is always mentioned before image
We must pay attention to this important principle in the BibleGods image is God expressed only when God is expressed can there be His image
People may sense that God is glorified in us or that God is glorified through us they may even feel that they see the likeness of God in us
Whoever damages the city damages God's glory; whoever damages the city prevents God's glory from being expressed
Authority is an outward expression, and glory is also an outward expression; neither authority nor expression is the inner source
In Genesis 1 there are outward image and authority , and in chapter 2 there are the tree of life and the river with four branches
Both God's authority and expression are in the church; without the church God's authority and expression are absent
The love that is of the spirit and that comes out of the Lord's love is the embodiment of authority; love is the embodiment of authority
It is only when we are enlightened before God that we can truly see that the church is entrusted with God's ruling
We should allow God to rule in our work, in our love for the brothers and sisters, and in our zealousness for the church life
There is something within us that flows out from the throne in the heavens; this flow brings God's authority into us and among us
When they and the church in which they serve allow God to reign, the expression of God's authority is among them
The exercise of man's authority by organization, arrangement, or having a name or position is shameful and hypocritical
The real authority comes when a group of God's children submit themselves under God's lordship and allow God to reign
We must see this basic principleGods authority is not expressed in an individual man but in a corporate man this man is the Body the church
We must not remain in Genesis 1; we must proceed to the Gospel of Matthew to see that authority is expressed in the church
The standard of the church requires that we abandon sin, the world, and the flesh; it also requires our complete termination
We may have good things, gain the praises of others, be gentle and mild, and even be zealous in our work yet have no authority
In other words, the church is built upon Christ, and Christ Himself is the material for the building of the church
The extent to which the element of 'man' is present in the church is the extent to which authority is diminished
The amount of authority present in the church depends upon how much the church is built with Christ as the material
Some saints say that it is difficult to be in one accord because the more capable ones do not have much regard for them
Only the part of our being that has been built upon Christ, that is, built with Christ as the material, is of real value
We may not seem to have much sin, the world, or even the flesh, yet the elements of our very being are present in us
We sense that man rather than Christ is there and that the church there is built with man rather than with Christ as the material
Even if we fall and cannot get up, the grace of God will come to be our supply to enable us to stand up once more
Regrettably, when God enlightens us and touches our feeling, we are often negligent and let the feeling pass in a light way
When the church is not present, authority also is not present, and people will be unable to touch authority in the church
May the Lord show us that there can be authority only in the church that is built through Christ, by Christ, and with Christ as the material
We need to bear in mind that this liveliness, this excitement, is often a veil to keep us from being enlightened
If we are overly excited, talk too much, or are too lively, we build a 'high wall' that prevents 'sunlight' from shining in
Of course, this does not mean that no one can pray loudly, but we should be careful if our voice causes discomfort in others' spirit
When we attend meetings in various localities, we should not spend much time shopping or visiting relatives and friends
The church is not merely the pillar and base of the truth; it is also the mystery of God manifested in the flesh
In view of this, we know for sure that the man, created by God with His image and authority in Genesis 1, must refer to the church
There was a need for the divine life signified by the tree of life in Genesis 2 to enter into the created man to enliven this 'photograph'
God, with His life, nature, and everything, with the fullness of the Godhead, mingles with us, without annulling our God-created humanity
Humanity as created by God in the beginning is fully preserved, but the sin, defilement, and corruption of fallen man are not preserved
If we do not have a clear understanding concerning this point, we will encounter many difficulties as we proceed on the path of the church
We can say that our journey has come to a juncture with numerous difficulties that cannot be solved by any method
Four thousand years after creation, a man was born in Bethlehem; this man was named Jesus, and He was also called Emmanuel
He was a man who was intelligent, wise, and loving, who was truly and fully man, a noble man, a man above all men
He had an emotion that loved God, a mind that cared for God's interest, and a will that stood with God, chose God, and desired God
On the day of Pentecost, those in the church were uneducated, insignificant men, but we can see that they were mingled with the almighty God
For two thousand years this enlargement has been ongoing throughout the earth; it keeps extending and spreading over the whole earth
The moment we are saved, we become the church in fact, but the proper condition of the church has yet to be manifested
The Christ in Matthew 16 is the Son of Man who is also the Son of God; He is the Son of God who is also the Son of Man
The Lord not only desires to build the church upon the mingling of God and man; He also desires to build this mingling into the church
Theoretically speaking, our gathering as three to five hundred believers in the Lord's name is the church, because the Lord is among us
The amount of the element of the church in this gathering depends upon how much we have allowed Christ to build in us
Although these words sounded quite impressive and moving, his later actions proved that it was not the reality
With resoluteness we should receive, consider, concentrate, desire, and turn our whole being toward the mingling of God and man within us
In many of us this is only an occasional occurrence because we have not fully allowed God to be our life and nature
On the twelve foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb
Some people are outgoing by nature; whenever there is an opportunity, they are always speaking, continually expressing their opinions
Most sisters have this disposition; it seems that all the time in the world would not be sufficient for them to express their opinions
There are other brothers and sisters who can keep their mouths shut even if they sit with others for three days
It is the strongest element of our human nature, and it does not express the mingling of God and man; it is not dual-natured
Rather, our greatest problem is that we have too many elements of the natural disposition that are praised by men and regarded as virtues
Our gentleness and our irritability will be in the hands of Satan; our silence and our speaking will also be in his hands
It is not as if these words are a kind of 'magic spell' that require the mere utterance of them for them to be fulfilled
Only what has been torn down and built up as the mingling of God and man is the church, and against this the gates of Hades cannot prevail
In the New Jerusalem whatever is of man will have been torn down and broken by God, and whatever is of God will have been built into man
Ephesians 2:20-22 shows this building on a small scale; however, it will be enlarged to be a city in the future
Please remember that the church is not a matter of name, position, or stand; neither is the church a matter of belief or organization
The believers are not manifesting the principle of the Body if they get along with each other simply because they have the same taste
In Chinese, English, and Greek, house refers to a dwelling place and can refer also to the members of a family
The living God who lives in the church, the house of mystery, is a living and subjective God; He is not a doctrinal and objective God
We need to understand what truth refers to when we say that the living God lives in the church, the pillar and base of the truth
John 1:17 says that truth-reality-came through Jesus Christ, and in 14:6 the Lord said that He is the truth, the reality
A large roof must be supported by pillars in order for it to withstand the test of storms and even earthquakes
Although the covering of the church is great and heavy the pillar is thin and small this is the true condition of what the church is to God
The testimony that the church bears is not doctrines that are preached and taught by the church; rather, it is God who rests on the church
As long as there is doctrine, there is opinion; we who serve the Lord must not dispute with others concerning doctrine
The church is not merely the pillar that upholds God; she is also a base upon which God places and builds Himself
In a building the base upholds the pillars, and the pillars uphold the entire structure; this is what the church is to God
Verse 15 speaks of the church, and verse 16 speaks of incarnation, because incarnation was enlarged when the church came into being
In Bethlehem God was manifested in the flesh on a small scale in one man; in the church God is manifested in millions of people
The manifestation of God that began on a small scale in Bethlehem will be enlarged and completed in the church
Ephesians 4:24 speaks of putting on the new man, and Colossians 3:10 says, 'And have put on the new man, which is being renewed'
The church as the house of the living God is the pillar and base that upholds the truth, manifesting the truth of God
In Colossians the new man has not yet been accomplished; it is being renewed according to the image of Him who created him
If we put these two verses together, we see that the image, which is in the church, is created by God in the truth
The manifestation of God's image in the church depends upon how much she allows God to create her in the truth
A church in a certain place with an appreciable amount of God's image proves that God has done a considerable amount of building there
Whatever is not of God, whatever is different from God, and whatever is not of the truth will be torn down by God
For this reason we need to be essentially remade in every part of our being-our preference, will, mind, emotion, character, and disposition
We must bear it, because this is the necessary path to be remade; we all need to be remade from within, from the very core of our being
Righteousness is to be properly related with everything, and holiness is to be set apart from everything other than God
When this happens there is no discord, no friction, no natural man, and no worldly mixture in the Body of Christ
Everything belongs to God and matches God; everything is righteous, holy, and true, thereby manifesting God's image spontaneously
We need spiritual eyes to see that this great person as the Head is in the heavens and that His Body is on earth
They may even speak of God while they preach, but in their actions and speech there is only man's element, not God's
We can say that the Lord made every move with God; the life He lived was the living of the mingling of God with man and man with God
We cannot separate the apostles from the Lord; every aspect and detail of their move in the gospel and work were mingled with God
We may have seen that the church is the Body of Christ and that as members of the Body our service should be corporate not individualistic
Our not being individualistic may be something worked out of ourselves; it may not be an expression of the mingling with God
Our coordination with the brothers and sisters may still be something out of ourselves; it may not be of the element of God within
If we do not have the mingling of God, our being individualistic is of the same value as our being in coordination
Is our service today a move out of one nature that is out of ourselves or the move of two natures that is out of the mingling of God with us
On the one hand, we put on the new man when we were saved , but on the other hand, it is still being renewed , even after we have put it on
All believers are a part of the Body, but the Body may not have much ground within them, and they may not have much reality of the Body
Paul can be compared to the wall of the New Jerusalem, which is exceedingly high, because God's building was within him
If we see the light and have understanding we will bow our heads and confess that we do not have much of an expression of the Body of Christ
We may serve God zealously and be in 'one accord,' but our serving might be out of ourselves and not out of God being mingled with us
They have been mingled with God and built up to the extent that it is difficult to distinguish whether it is God or them
A group of believers might not express the Body of Christ if they do not have the reality of the Body of Christ
We must ask the brothers and sisters, who are learning to serve the Lord, how much of the Body of Christ is among them
You may serve zealously, be in 'one accord,' and never quarrel, but you may not have much of the element of the Body of Christ
It is possible that all of your work is thoroughly and completely of the element of man, not of the element of God
If we are the source, we do not have the Body; only that which comes out of God's building within us is the Body
In Ephesians 1 Paul says The church which is His Body the fullness of the One who fills all in all and in chapter 2 he speaks of building
The fullness of the Godhead in Christ has not been built and constituted into them; hence, they remain the same, still living out themselves
The Body of Christ is the issue of the believers being built up with Christ, being mingled with God, and being constituted with Christ
Ephesians 4 has a twofold building-the building up by the ministry of the gifts and the building up by the Body itself
Someone may ask, 'Since the church is the Body of Christ, can people touch the Body of Christ in the various localities'?
Without these matters, our coordination is the coordination of 'corpses,' within which there is no life, only death
What we have may be doctrines, regulations, organization, and a coordination by arrangement rather than by our living in Christ
If our submission is of the element of man and does not come out of the mingling of Christ within, then it is not of the Body of Christ
There is a kind of coordination in submission that has passed through God's working and dealing and has been built by and mingled with God
Such a coordination through Christ is living, full of vitality, and fresh, and it causes people to smell the flavor of God
Once people touch this coordination, they feel that they have touched Christ and that they worship God, sensing that God is present
Only this is the Body of Christ, the expression of God's image in the universe, and only this can reign for God on earth
The significance of the church as the house, the dwelling place, and the temple of God is in God being mingled with man
How much the Lord can be expressed and how much He can move and work on earth today altogether depend upon His Body
If Christ is built up in us and God is mingled with us, there will be a practical result, which is the expression of the Body of Christ
Ephesians 2:14-16 says, 'He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition
In English, building can be both a verb and a noun; in Greek, the word building in both its verbal form and noun form have the same root
In its verbal form, it means 'God is building'; in its noun form, it refers to the church as 'the building of God'
There are twelve kinds of precious stones, which are the twelve foundations, and the surrounding wall is jasper
Today all the Lord's workers are building upon this foundation; all who serve the churches should do a building work upon this foundation
When we come to the Lord, we are living stones; the Lord will build these living stones up little by little and piece by piece
We should not think that the church, the house, that the apostles were building is not the holy city that God is building
We should not consider God's creation to be His building work; His creation prepared the materials for His building
In the Old Testament, even though God did not begin the building, He used types and figures to describe the building He desired
The effectiveness of the Lord's death and resurrection is also included in the Spirit in order to do the building work
The Lord first spoke of the building when those with Him began to realize that the Son of Man is the Son of God
From that point onward, there is a central line in the New Testament that continuously speaks of this building
On the one hand, God is working, building in heaven; on the other hand, the apostles, those who have a ministry, are building on earth
We know that the city is this dwelling place from Revelation 21:3, which says that the holy city is the tabernacle of God with men
In the future the holy city will be the enlargement of the ultimate completion of the church, the consummation of God's building
Today in Christianity there is too much instruction and teaching but very little building; there is much teaching but almost no building
God is not emphasizing teaching in the church today; any emphasis on teaching should be for the sake of building
We were shown mercy to have a part in this building work; we are a part of this work, and we are a worker in this work
We should all know that God has a great work; God is building a dwelling place in the universe, and we have a part in it
If we closely observe the condition in Christianity and the situation among us we will be deeply grieved because we do not see Gods building
Our virtues, such as diligence and meekness, are of no value; the key is whether the building of God is in us and among us
In relation to the building, God speaks of breaking down the middle wall of partition through the cross in Ephesians 2:14-16
If we did not have the old creation, there would be no flesh and no law, and without the law there would be no middle wall of partition
Those who are well behaved keep the law; those who are not well behaved break the law and condemn themselves before the law
If man had not fallen and become the flesh, God would not have needed to give the law; it would have been sufficient to have God as life
The law at Mount Sinai was added by God so that man would know the flesh and so that the flesh would be condemned
Once the cross breaks down the old creation, the distinctions between Jews and Gentiles are over, and the two become one
The sisters feel that they are 'Israelites' because they are meek and that the brothers are 'Gentiles' because they are rough and wild
In the church life those who are willing to speak may feel that they are 'non-Gentiles' and that those who do not speak are 'Gentiles'
Those who always open their mouths to 'fellowship' in this way often secretly justify themselves for being good and weighty
Those who do not speak will no longer condemn those who speak, and those who love to speak will no longer condemn those who do not
We will no longer feel that he is an elder rather we will feel that Christ is in him the building of Christ is in him and God is in him
In the church life young people among us often complain, saying, 'All the elders do is step on us and look down on us
We must know that all of our criticisms, differing views, and feelings that we are right and others are wrong are the flesh
Whether we are the old creation can be determined by looking at whether we are built upon Christ and joined to Him
In the Holy Spirit we can clearly sense our self-justification and self-righteousness, as well as our criticism and condemnation of others
We will realize that these feelings are not of Christ, not in Christ, and not joined to Christ; rather, they come out of ourselves
The Holy Spirit will show us that these feelings are natural, only coming out of our knowledge, learning, and education
To have the building is to have the Body, the church, the image of God, and the authority of God expressed through the building
Ultimately, when the city appears, all the nations will submit to the authority of the city; this is an expression of authority
In the universe, there is a breadth, length, height, and depth; however, it is difficult for man to describe these
The love in which we are being rooted and grounded is God and Christ the breadth length height and depth in verse 18 are also God and Christ
We can also say that the love of Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth, because the love of Christ is God, just as Christ is God
The love is the love of Christ, and the love of Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe
Many of us have seen this phrase when we read the Bible, but we neither know nor understand what the fullness of Christ is in actuality
The Greek word for fullness is a very emphatic word, but regrettably, many Bible translators do not have this realization
Ephesians 3:19 says, 'That you may be filled unto all the fullness of God,' and Colossians 2:9 refers to 'all the fullness of the Godhead'
The Chinese Union Version is a good translation of the Bible; however, it lacks spiritual revelation in the translation of these verses
We can say that mankind is the fullness of Adam, the overflow of Adam; all human beings are the children of Adam, the descendants of Adam
Perhaps someone would call himself a Chinese or an American; however, whether he is a Chinese or an American, he is a man in the world
If we know the truth, we would acknowledge that we are the descendants of Adam, a small part of the fullness of Adam, the overflow of Adam
If we have offspring, our offspring are our fullness, just as the descendants of Adam are the fullness of Adam
Paul could only describe this fullness with 'the breadth and length and height and depth,' because it is truly indescribable
We do not have the sense that this God, this Christ, this Holy Spirit, and this life are an immeasurable fullness
We must ask for the Lord's mercy that we would truly sense and realize in our spirit that we have something within us called the fullness
Though we are the church, we do not manifest much of the Body because the fullness has not been manifested in us
Though we have received of this fullness, we do not allow this fullness to be manifested; this fullness cannot be seen in us
Though we partake of this fullness, it is as if we have not received of this fullness; we feel that we are still empty and void
We can say that our services, our prayers, and all our spiritual conditions are in utter destitution and that we are weak and poor
If we do not sense the fullness in us, but instead we feel void, empty, old, weak, and poor, there must be a problem in us
It would be unseemly to break the bread but say, 'O Lord, this is Your Body, but please overlook our weak condition'
We all acknowledge that we are still in the flesh and have our weaknesses but inwardly we have been attached to a source called the fullness
We need to see a basic principle: all believers have been inwardly attached to a source, which is called the fullness
For this reason we are unable to say that the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
Ephesians 4:12-13 says that only through building can the church arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
It is only after the constant building work that the stature increases continually to the point of having a definite form
In this way, the building continues to a point that the fullness of Christ has attained a measure of stature in a group of people
When we look at our situation, we find that we do not have the fullness and that we do not have the measure of the stature
It would be incorrect for us to say that he does not have the Lord within him, yet the Lord within him is almost without shape or form
The Bible rarely speaks of begetting the church, but in many places it speaks of the building up of the church
God not only spends much time and effort in the building of the church, but He also speaks much concerning how He builds the church
In other words, everything that is natural in us, whether it is good or bad, able or unable to match God, must be torn down by God
When a man dies, he simply dies, but when our Lord died on the cross, the process He went through was very thorough
Death may not have done all that it can in some people, but death exhausted everything it could do on the Lord Jesus
If there was only the step of incarnation, we would see God entering into man, but we would not see man entering into God
If God's work stopped with incarnation, God would have entered into man, but man would be unable to enter into God
In His incarnation, prior to His resurrection, we could point to Him and say that there was a man on earth who had divinity within Him
Through incarnation the Lord Jesus brought God to earth; through resurrection the Lord Jesus brought man to heaven
Abraham believed that God is the One who calls the things not being as being he also believed that God is the One who gives life to the dead
One kind of work is the work of creation, and the other is the work of redemption, which is also the work of building
We often consider God's building as a part of His redemption; hence, it is easy to emphasize only redemption and neglect building
When God made the female, man already existed, so God put man into death and built a woman out of death and resurrection
God's building Eve was not simply a creation; rather, it was a building work using the material He had already created
Christians always include building in redemption; thus, people pay attention only to redemption and neglect building
People have been taught that the Lord Jesus went to prepare a heavenly mansion, to prepare many little rooms in the heavenly mansion
God never intended to build a church on earth and a mansion in heaven and then one day to relocate and move from earth to heaven
After creation He accomplished redemption; after redemption He is still carrying out one work, and this work is building
Matthew 16 speaks of this building and John 14 also speaks of this building however this speaking was only in preparation for the building
When this building is fully accomplished, the New Jerusalem will appear, and it will be the full consummation of the building of God
God's only building work is to build Himself into the believers and to build the believers into Himself; this is His building
There are also countless books promoting this kind of edification among Christians; almost everyone who reads them is touched and 'edified'
Anything that is of our natural being, whether good or bad, must be put to death, for without tearing down there is no building of God
We believe that this is God's perfecting work, His edification work; little do we know that this is not God's work
In every Scripture passage that speaks of building, we can see from the context or the text itself the matter of tearing down
The Lord also said, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
If we look up all the verses on building, we will discover that in each instance the Lord also speaks of tearing down
The ministry of the word is a needle to give people a 'shot,' whether they love their wives, are meek, or are short tempered
We must bow our heads and worship God that these ones, who are not fresh and living, have a little more element of Christ within
Perhaps some would say that this is lamentable, but without this shattering, this tearing down, there is no building
Without the tearing down, God cannot be built into man, and without this tearing down, man cannot be built into God
Even after His incarnation, the Son of God still had to pass through the destruction of death in order to enter into resurrection
We can see that God and man, man and God have truly been mingled and become one; God is in man and man is in God
While he is experiencing this he may feel that it is very uncomfortable and painful the condition of his family is neither seemly nor proper
After a period of time, a person whose being is opened has more of the element of God, and the element of Christ is increased within him
When we contact him, we contact one who is broken, not whole; he is one in whom we can smell the fragrance of Christ
Ephesians 123 speaks of the church as the fullness of Christ and Colossians 29 says In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily
Everything of God is in Christ, and everything of Christ is in the church; therefore, the church is a great matter
Everything in the Godhead is expressed through Christ, and everything that is in Christ is expressed through the church
According to a basic principle in the Bible, the first mention of a matter establishes the definition and the principle of that matter
In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus said that He is 'the way and the reality and the life'; He did not say that He is grace
John 1 puts grace and reality together; hence, we can see that grace and reality are not two separate things but are actually one thing
Anything that God gives to us outside of Himself cannot be called grace; only when He gives Himself to us can that be called grace
Whenever the Bible speaks of grace, it refers to God, the life of God, or matters related to life and redemption
That may be God's kindness toward us, but please remember that the Bible never uses the word grace when speaking of such things
The Bible refers to such things as blessings or benefits from God, but it never uses grace in reference to such blessings or benefits
In the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, and through Him grace has come
In other words, the Gospel of John reveals God to us, and this is reality; it also gives God to us, and this is grace
He also enables us to receive the God whom we have seen; the expressed God desires to enter into us to become our possession
The greeting and blessing that the apostle wrote at the end of Philippians says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit'
In other words, this fullness is grace and reality, and grace and reality are God Himself; therefore, this fullness is God Himself
The distinction is that the goodness of some people is without vigor; it is the same as something that is dead, without the breath of life
Often we contact a group of brothers and sisters who are good, yet their goodness can be compared to a piece of dead wood with no vigor
Some have a meekness that can be compared to the meekness of a stone statue; they are truly meek, but there is no life in their meekness
Sometimes we meet a saint who is full of love and diligence, yet all we sense is death; there is no supply of life and no anointing
Although we may feel some pain, there is still the anointing within, and we can still touch God and be refreshed
We all know that the church is the fullness of Christ, but how do we know whether a particular church has the fullness?
If we touch the anointing, freshness, and livingness in a locality, we should sense that the fullness, the church, is in that locality
We can contact a group of fervent saints in a locality and not sense the fullness or any overflow of life among them
Even though their voice echoes throughout the meeting, it does not touch man's spirit, and there is no anointing in man's spirit
If our person has been broken and Christ has been built into us, then what we do is of Christ and is the fullness
We know that wherever we touch livingness, freshness, and the anointing, there is life; to touch life is to touch the fullness
When we put two flowers side by side, people can readily recognize which one is real and which one is artificial because life is very real
In the church we should not look merely at the outward appearance; we need to touch the intrinsic content of the church
In other words, we need to touch the anointing and the life within; we need to touch the Lord's living presence
Before life passes through death, life is merely life, but after life passes through death, it is resurrection
If we sense the anointing and the presence of the Lord when we are with him, we may conclude that this must be of life
He may feel that the elders should not 'deal with him' because he comes to serve the church; therefore, he withdraws
Without passing through death there is no strength richness and fullness once something passes through death it becomes strong rich and full
In this situation of resurrection the fullness is here; resurrection is a sign of the fullness and a content of the fullness
If the Lord would have mercy on us and put us in trials, we would see how much is left of us after the trial of death
In John 812 the Lord said I am the light of the world he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
Whether a local church is an expression of the Body can be determined by whether that locality is full of light
Sometimes when we come to a local church, we may feel that it is like a bomb shelter which is dark and dismal inside
We can also be dismal and miserable within but when we come to the Lords table meeting we begin to feel bright transparent and refreshed
We can also have an experience of feeling sorrowful, of groping in the dark, and of not knowing how to proceed
After we say a few words, we feel that we are transparent and that the church, the Body, and the fullness are present
Whenever a church denies the self and touches the fullness of Christ, the church is His fullness in experience
In the meetings of some localities it seems as if what was clear becomes unclear, and it is difficult to find the way
Perhaps a person cannot get through inwardly with a particular problem, but suddenly he thinks of going and fellowshipping with the elders
After he sits with them for half an hour or an hour, the frustration within him is released, and consequently there is a way within him
If we sit with a believer for a while, a way is often manifest within us even though we might not say anything
In some saints a person can spontaneously touch the way when he comes to them because they live in the fullness
In other words, it is through death that God can enter into man, and it is also through death that man can enter into God
For a tree to be grafted into another tree, a branch must be cut off from one tree and the other tree must be cut open
For God to be joined to man, God must pass through death; for man to be joined to God, man must also pass through death
The issue of God's building is also the fullness of the One who fills all in all, that is, the fullness of Christ
The procedure of God's building is breaking, and the material of God's building is the element of the fullness of Christ
Although God entered into us when we were saved, He has not yet been built into our constitution, into every part of our being
His thoughts are merely his thoughts, his preferences are his preferences, his opinions are his opinions, and his person is also his person
Although he has some fear before God and an outward appearance of godliness before men, God cannot be mingled with him in his living
It seems as if he does not make mistakes and is not contaminated by sin, but he is still himself; what he lives out is only himself
We should not suppose that a group of brothers and sisters living together in harmony and behaving properly is the Body of Christ
It seems that the more we pursue God, the more frustrations we have, the more difficulties arise, and the more our health fails
In yet another example, everything that is displayed in the windows of shops on the streets is beautiful and attractive
We may never meet a pursuer of the Lord who has no problems in his body, in his home, in his career, or in his environment
Every one of our children has been given to us by God, and every one of our children is used by God to deal with us
We should realize that from the time we are saved, God has no intention of doing anything other than building in us
Although the older brother cannot speak fluently, people touch life, gain Christ, and receive a spiritual supply after listening to him
Through a great deal of tearing down, the element of God has been added into them and the element of Christ has increased within them
A person who has been built by God with the element of the fullness is able to give life to people at any time
Sometimes in contacting a brother, we sense that he is full of light, and even we ourselves are full of light when with him
It may also seem that when we leave him, we are in darkness, but as soon as we are with him, we are in the light
We can sense God is with them in their preferences, and even their opinions cause us to sense that God is with them
Those who have learned this lesson know that sometimes God will not let go of even a little thought or a slight preference of ours
When God's hand comes in, it strikes us, tears us down, and destroys us so that He can bring many natural elements within us into death
With the Body of Christ, it is a matter of progress and growth; with the house of God, it is a matter of building
His prayer had the Lord's presence, his preaching was with power, and his fellowship with others was fresh and full of Christ
The more we fall, the more secure and full it becomes, because it is of resurrection and is able to withstand falling
After being touched by an elder, he sat at the back of the Lord's table meeting, and his voice could not be heard
Once it is put into death, it is given the opportunity to manifest the fullness within by growing more grain or pretty flowers
God's building work in us has two aspects: one aspect is to build Himself into us, and the other aspect is to build us into Himself
One who has not been dealt with by God may be weak in his will, but one who has been dealt with by God becomes firm in his will
One who has not been dealt with by God may be confused in his thoughts, but one in whom God is built is clear and enriched in his thoughts
One who has not been dealt with by God does not have many genuine emotions, and even if he has, they are not properly used
We need to know that God's building does not nullify us but develops and uplifts our being and builds us into Him
Since he said plainly that he had no commandment of the Lord, what he spoke was not the Lord's direct speaking
Was a person an apostle who said that what he spoke was not the commandment of God it was not the Lords charge but rather his own speaking
In His redemption God does not nullify our being; instead, He brings us into Himself and builds us into Himself
He could say that even though he spoke without the Lord's charge, the Lord's commandment, he had the Spirit of God
Can we truly say that we have the Holy Spirit in our speaking, even though we have not received a direct word of the Lord?
If we cannot say this, we have not fully entered into God, much of our element is still outside of God, and we have not been built into God
Even without the Lords revelation the Lords word or the Lords commandment we will be able to say that we have the Holy Spirit when we speak
Even without His commandment or His word on a particular matter, we can have His Spirit and be in His Spirit when we speak
Even if a person has light and revelation, he still needs to take heed before the Lord to have some understanding
If a person is negligent, the light he sees concerning such a mysterious thing as the Body will flash past him
We need to pray, asking the Lord to firmly fix the light within us, just as Joshua prayed for the sun not to set
When we receive light, we need to immediately pray, asking the Lord to retain the light and not let it fade away
With some brothers and sisters, when the Lord's word is released in a meeting, light flashes in them like lightning in the sky
They need to be careful lest the light gradually diminish and completely fade away by the time they leave the meeting
In this way the Holy Spirit will unveil in us, scene by scene, that the contents of the fullness are life, resurrection, light, and the way
Everything related to the church must be the overflow of Christ; anything that is not of the fullness is not the church
While sitting in a meeting, we should ask whether we are listening to a message to receive teachings or to receive food
Someone else may invite us over for a meal and put out only a small amount of ordinary food, but he says, 'Please eat as much as you can'
Determining whether we have the reality of the church is greatly tested by whether people receive food when they come to meet with us
On the last day of the feast, the Lord stood and cried out, saying, 'If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink'
Marvelously, it is also possible for us to be silent in a prayer meeting yet be inwardly satisfied after the meeting
If the saints have a sense of frustration and thirst after a prayer meeting, that church has a problem before the Lord
If a prayer meeting lacks the flow of living water and is neither refreshing nor watering, the saints cannot be satisfied
He may not hear much doctrine or exhortation during the meeting but after the meeting he is inwardly refreshed enlivened and truly satisfied
As a result, people may not hear much doctrine or understand much concerning salvation, but they are satisfied within and can say, 'Oh!
Once, as a couple was entering the meeting hall for their wedding meeting, a thirty-year-old widow also walked by
She and her family had never had any contact with Christianity and according to the local custom they would never accept a foreign religion
When she saw the wedding that day, she was touched and she believed and received the Lord following just a few words of exhortation
Such a locality has lost the Lord's presence and has not allowed the Lord's satisfaction to flow out of the saints
When the condition of a local church is normal, when a local church is strong, the meetings will always give people the sense of freedom
Some may say that this is merely a psychological effect; however, spiritual matters are more real than anything else
If Christ has the ground in us and He can live out of us, we will know that there is a power in us that can release others
Regardless of how much they sing, the church will not be revived, and there will not be freedom in the meeting
Once he sits down and sings 'Revive Thy work, O Lord' in such an atmosphere, his whole being will become bound; he will be unable to move
Our being broken and living before the Lord, His being built within us, and the church being the expression of Christ's Body cannot be faked
Whether it is an announcement given by a responsible brother or an exhortation from another brother, the saints have a feeling of lightness
Sometimes a responsible brother may stand up and give a short announcement that the saints feel is quite weighty and glorious
Whenever man touches God, he senses glory; whenever man is before the light of God's presence, he senses glory
When a person lives before God, even if he only stands up to introduce the brothers and sisters, the introduction will be glorious
When others shed tears before us, this indicates that they are comforted by us, that is, they are cherished and warmed by us
If a table meeting is full of the Lord's presence, full of the expression of the fullness, many people will shed tears in the meeting
If a meeting is an expression of the fullness, there will be love in that fullness; people will receive warmth, comfort, and sympathy
Ephesians gives four different expressions concerning the church: the Body, the dwelling place, the wife, and the warrior
Christ the Head can express Himself, live out Himself, and do what He desires in the universe only through the church as the Body
He is still expressing Himself, living out Himself, and ushering in His move and work on earth through the church, His Body
Through such a universal Body Christ expresses Himself, lives out Himself and moves and works in this universe
In Exodus the thought of God's need for a dwelling place was revealed after He saved the Israelites out of Egypt
In the universe, God has been longing to find a counterpart for His Son, Christ; that counterpart is the church
The warrior in chapter 6 is the church, not an individual; the armor is also a corporate armor, not the armor for an individual saint
The city is the aggregate of the four previously mentioned items: the Body, the dwelling place, the wife, and the warrior
In this age the church is a dwelling place a temple for God to dwell in in eternity this dwelling place will be enlarged becoming a city
The city is a warrior but in eternity when Gods enemy is completely dealt with there will be no darkness no death and no need for fighting
Especially during warfare, anyone who cannot submit to authority has no place as a warrior; soldiers must submit absolutely to authority
In the holy city, New Jerusalem, God's authority is firmly established; the throne of God with His authority is in the city
In this city there is the throne of God, signifying God's authority, and there is the life of God as its content
Paul did not exhort us to be united as one in Ephesians 4:3; rather, he exhorted us to diligently keep the oneness of the Spirit
Our responsibility is not to be united; our responsibility is to keep the oneness that already exists in the church
Some people say that the church cannot be united and that we should not expect the church to be united, because everyone has his own view
They say that although we have the same Bible, we have different viewpoints and interpretations of this same Bible
Although this type of speaking may seem quite logical, we must see that the church is not a matter of being united
Since their background, origin, education, and environment are all different, their concepts and views are also different
In Him the one new man has been created, and we have been built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit
We can say that everyone has different characteristics, or we can say that everyone has different peculiarities and dispositions
Everyone has distinctions, regardless of whether they are old or young, male or female, high school or college students
When Christ is built into us we will have something beautiful among us the oneness which is Christ Himself God Himself and the Holy Spirit
When this oneness is expressed, the Body, the dwelling place, the bride, the warrior, and the city are manifested
Without this oneness we cannot express the Body the dwelling place the bride the warrior and the city everything depends on this oneness
In the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free man, but Christ is all and in all
If we allow Him to build Himself into us, He will be with us in our living, and in our every move He will walk with us
Even if we have some light and some feeling within, the oneness of the church will be damaged by our unwillingness to surrender ourselves
If, through the cross, we allow Christ to have the ground in us to destroy all the differences in us, the oneness will be manifested
When this oneness is manifested, there will be one Body, one dwelling place, one bride, one warrior, and one city
Only when an offering needs to be sent to a distant place should the church open the envelope and remit the money through a bank
May we continue to receive mercy and keep this position by giving the Spirit the absolute position, lordship, and freedom
A basic principle in the Bible is that the ministry should transfer a burden to the churches when they are able to bear that burden
The church is the fullness of Christ, expressing Christ; wherever Christ is expressed, there is the reality of the church
Paul's Epistles show that the church, as the fullness of Christ to express Christ, needs to pass through much building
In social organizations there are people who are enthusiastic for public welfare and who diligently render service to the public
Such merits, which come from man's natural being, do not have the element of Christ; instead, they have the element of Adam
Others may praise us, and we may be thankful to God, thinking that these virtues are the result of God's moving within us
Although his salvation through repentance has delivered him from gross sins, he is still unable to express much of Christ's element
On the one hand, we acknowledge the fact of his salvation and testify that it is the work of Christ within him by His grace
It takes only a moment for Christ to enter into us at our salvation, but it is not that simple for Christ to come out of us
He can discern whether the human excitement is merely the fervency of one who loves the Lord or Christ Himself
They had problems because some insisted on renting a two-story building, and others insisted on a one-story building
We can be accommodating to the extent that we do not have our own opinion or our own feeling; we will not insist on anything
Christ coming out of us is not part of our natural constitution, and it is not something we obtain at the moment of our salvation
They see that these things are not Christ Himself but have instead replaced Christ, usurped Christ's position, and are even against Christ
The saints who receive mercy from the Lord are enlightened within to see what is out of man and what is out of Christ
As soon as these saints encounter opposition, they cease to be excited and zealous; instead, they are deflated and simply withdraw
Others, however, rejecting the light, also become deflated and fall apart; thus, they can no longer be naturally excited
When a group of saints are passing through God's tearing down, they may not be as lively, excited, and loving the Lord as before
God's Word reveals that the work of those who minister the word is to build up the Body of Christ; this building includes tearing down
When a person is enlightened, he will see his real condition; he will see the things in him that are not of Christ
When the light shines in a person, he needs to pass through a period of time to allow the light to work within him
When by grace a person remains under the shining, convicting, and accepting of light, there is the tearing down
Man often needs the Spirit of God and the light of God to do a severe work within him that human hands cannot aid
Under this kind of condition, a person may feel uncomfortable from morning to evening; it seems that he is doing everything
Whether he is standing or sitting, visiting or not visiting, reading the Bible or not reading the Bible, everything seems to be from himself
Anyone who desires to be built must pass through a process of allowing the light to shine within him every day
When he speaks, Christ will come forth; there will be something solid that can touch people, not empty doctrine
When he speaks, he can touch man's heart, he knows man's natural difficulty, and he knows the activity of Christ's enemy
When he visits the saints and fellowships with them, he can touch their difficulties and touch the enemy who frustrates Christ within them
In our environment God arranges persons matters and things our spouse children relatives and the brothers and sisters are all for our need
Whoever has not been delivered from the self and still remains in the natural being does not have the expression of the Body of Christ
The Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ, the Christ who has been built into us and is expressed through us
Our God as the Lord has the authority and the way; He not only gives us the word and light, but He also arranges our environment
In the meetings we may be reproved within even though the brothers and sisters are not speaking specifically to us
There will be the reality of the Body of Christ only when Christ is built up from within those who receive grace
If we know the church, we will see that the church is the place where God is mingled with man and where man expresses God
Everything of God is in this corporate body, and through this new corporate body God's splendor and glory are expressed
The content of the city is God Himself, the fullness of God; the expression of the city is also God Himself, the glory of God
The fullness of the Creator becomes the content of the creatures, and the glory of the Creator becomes the expression of the creatures
In the New Jerusalem we see the mingling of man with God and we see that God can express Himself from within man
Throughout human history, man's denial of God's authority, his setting of God's authority aside, offends God to the uttermost
Submitting to God's restriction and rule, He passed through death and resurrection to save a group of people who became the church
When Gods authority is in the church the church is full of light not darkness full of life not death and full of Gods blessing not cursing
Verse 3 says, 'Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ'
If a local church does not have God's throne, His authority, we cannot see His fullness, His mingling, or His expression
The young ones may not submit to the elderly ones, and the elderly ones have not learned to submit to God's authority
Their love for one another is in the emotion, not in God's authority, and their fervent service is of the will, not of God's authority
Their love is neither restricted nor controlled; instead of being under God's authority, it is like a wild horse
When she hears the announcement about cleaning the meeting hall, she comes to clean the hall because she loves the Lord very much
The sisters cleaning the windows should be under God's throne, and the elders taking the lead should also be under God's throne
We need to know whether our being of the same mind and our having the same taste are according to God's throne
In preaching the gospel and in the meetings of the church we must not merely have activity and discussion without Gods throne and authority
Out of this throne proceeds the river of water of life with the function of watering, refreshing, and thirst quenching
On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month'
From this we can see that every local church should be a place where people are fed, nourished, watered, and satisfied
The tree of life grows on both sides of the river of water of life, producing twelve fruits each year as its fullness and abundance
When a local church is full of the fruits of life, producing new fruit every month, the abundance of life will be fully manifested
Although there are twelve gates in the New Jerusalem, there is only one street because there is only one throne
Everyone in that locality will have a clear way; no one will ever be lost and feel uncertain as to what he should do
We have the way to walk, the river of water of life to drink, and the fruit of the tree of life to eat; these three are very rich
People find living water on this street richly enjoy the fruit of the tree of life are refreshed and satisfied and their thirst is quenched
The expression of the holy city depends on the throne, the street, the river, and the growth of the tree of life
In Revelation 4 we see God's throne and God's image; the One sitting on the throne is like a jasper stone in appearance
Only when there is the throne can there be the image, and only then can God exercise His authority and be expressed
Since the throne is in the New Jerusalem, there will be no more night, only brightness; there will be no more death, only life
It does not depend on our methods or ideas nor on our enthusiasm or diligence; rather, it depends entirely on God's throne, His authority
We have already seen that the church is the fullness of Christ and that the throne of God, the authority of God, is in the church
Ephesians 4:15-16 has a particular place because no other portion in the Bible speaks of coordination as thoroughly as these two verses
These verses show how the church as the Body of Christ can be coordinated and how the Body itself grows and is built up through coordination
In the midst of today's confusion, every place is full of all kinds of teachings, interpretations, and instructions
Since Ephesians 4:15 says that we need to 'grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ,' what should be our basis and standard?
Any teaching or interpretation that does not cause us to touch God should be rejected, even if it is doctrinally correct
They have found portions from the Bible proving that sisters should either cover their heads or not cover their heads
We should apply this test before God if a message does not cause us to touch God even if it is doctrinally correct we need to put it aside
If their speaking causes us to be disconnected from Him, we should reject it, even if the speaking is doctrinally correct
Holding to truth in love means that we have a heart of love toward God, and we hold the things that enable us to touch God in love
The Lord will cause them to live before the Lord and administrate the church by touching His feeling and being mingled with Him
We need to learn to touch the Lord's presence, to live in the Lord, to hold on to Christ the Head, and to hold to truth
We must be clear that our being is not yet completely saved; we still do the Lord's work and administrate the church out of ourselves
There was a co-worker who was going to visit a certain church for three days and was passing by another church on the way
They gave a very good reason for needing the co-worker's help, saying that they had a group of young students with a good spiritual future
Originally, he was going to be at the first church for three days, but after changing his plans he could be there for only two days
In our service, which is holy and good, we must learn an important lesson: we cannot forsake holding to truth in order to reach a goal
If this should be our attitude in things that are holy and good, how much more should it be in other things as well?
We may do something in a certain way and be successful, but will this cause us to be separated from Christ our Head?
It is possible for us to accomplish a task and gain some benefit yet lose the Lord's presence and the inward reality
We need to have God's authority and touch the Lord's presence even in small matters such as picking up gospel invitations
When we learn to touch God's presence within, we will pick up only two thousand invitations, even if twenty thousand are available
The coordination of the Body is essentially based upon the fact that the members grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things
If all the brothers and sisters would do this, there would no longer be friction between the members or any discord in our coordination
We have many opinions, and we like to enthrone ourselves instead of yielding the position of the Head to Christ
Our submission to authority before the Lord is not submitting to the elders; it is our submitting to the authority of the Head
We should submit to every brother and sister, not only to the elders, because the authority of the Head is manifested in every member
The basic requirement of the coordination of the Body is to submit ourselves to the Head and grow up into the Head in all things
In the same principle, if one member does not function, it will cause great trouble to the coordination of the Body
Our functioning depends on how much we have been dealt with, torn down, and how much Christ has been built up in us
Many in the churches have received grace to be the joints of rich supply so that there can be a flowing out to supply other members
The fulfilling of our function depends on how much we have been torn down by God and how much Christ has been built up within us
They do not allow God to tear them down or to build Christ into them; neither do they learn to grow up into Christ the Head in all things
Although there are many people in the churches, they are weak because not much of their usefulness and function is manifested
They should leave certain things, which are outside their limit, for the other brothers, because God has not measured that much to them
God has not measured this function to our hands; the function and measure of the hands is to handle, to hold things
Their going beyond their limit paralyzes the coordination of the Body and causes the coordination of the Body to be abnormal
In the coordination of the Body, every member needs to stay within its measure and operate according to its measure
Some brothers and sisters do not feel that it is safe to entrust things to others; they feel that they must do everything
Some members think that they can do everything, and other members think that they can do nothing, as if their existence is of no consequence
Each member moves and works according to its limit and measure, not going beyond or falling short of its limit
If we do this, the church in our locality will be living, beautiful, and strong and will experience daily increase and growth
Although the universe has been corrupted, it still maintains a certain degree of orderliness; everything is on track and in good order
When a person is sitting, he is not fully upright; when he lies down, he is even less so and is actually horizontal
Outwardly, it seems as if the human body is holding up the head; however, the body cannot stand if the head is removed
If we cut off an arm from the body, the body can still stand, but if the head is cut off, the body can no longer stand
If the head loses its position and order, there is no authority in the body; the body will be paralyzed and will collapse, becoming useless
Our holding to the Head and growing up into the Head in all things is our submission to the authority of the Head
If these two verses did not imply authority, there would be no need to speak of the Head; it would be sufficient to speak only of Christ
These two verses do not speak of Christ only in relation to life; they speak of the Head in relation to authority
Our growing up into the Head is our submission to the authority of the Head, allowing the Head to have authority in every matter
Some saints may allow the Lord to have authority in their service to God and to the Lord but not in their finances and family life
We should not expect to have a good relationship with the members when we do not have a good relationship with the Head
We need to know the Head, honor the Head, allow Him to be the Lord, and allow Him to have the authority and ground in us
We must not only submit ourselves to the authority of the Head; we must also maintain a proper relationship with all the members
Under God's sovereign authority and arrangement, some saints are above us, but envy and strife may cause us to try to be on top
We should never suppose that this order relates to being high or low, great or small, among the members of the Body
The most serious problem in the church is not knowing God's order and not knowing that coordination depends upon order
When the saints do not function there is no coordination when the saints function beyond their limit there are problems in the coordination
Other brothers and sisters are too distant from others, too polite to others, and never able to connect with others
Although we know that we should submit to the authority of the elders and the older saints, sometimes nothing can force us to submit to them
Our ability to submit to authority depends on the lessons we have learned from the Lord's hand by being torn down by the Lord
Pieces of stone need to be hammered and dealt with before they can be joined properly; otherwise, they are merely a pile of stones
Genuine coordination is the result of building and breaking; it is the issue of being dealt with by the Lord's hand
If we are a human, we must be a Christian, and if we are a Christian, we have no choice but to be in the church
After two or three months we will be unable to endure it, because we have not passed through God's hand and have not been broken
Many young saints, thinking that the church in their locality is not good, continually desire to move to another locality
If we are 'round,' we want our church to be 'round' so that we can fit in perfectly; however, this is impossible
If we are 'round,' God would put us in a 'square' church; if we are 'square,' the church will be a 'round' church
He knows what God's arrangement is in the Body, and he knows that he is under the Head and also under certain members
He has the Spirit and life, or we may say he has the ruling of authority in him that causes him to know his place and order in the Body
To determine whether a person is the authority placed by God over us, we merely need to disobey or oppose him a little, and we will know
As soon as we refuse to submit, our prayer is not sweet, our fellowship is not clear, and everything within us is in a state of confusion
Rather, our problems are because we do not want to be broken, and we are hardened toward the Lord, not submitting to His authority
If we do not submit to the authority of the brother placed next to us by God, we cannot get through with the Head and will be unable to pray
We should realize that those who are more advanced and deeper in the Lord than we are have a measure of authority that is of the Head
We may replace our submission to authority with our patience and tolerance, or our submission to authority may be full of a worldly flavor
Corinthians 122627 says Whether one member suffers all the members suffer with it or one member is glorified all the members rejoice with it
The greater scope is presented in 2 Corinthians 11:28-29, in which the apostle Paul speaks of his anxious concern for all the churches
Corinthians 11 shows a great and broad consciousness; 1 Corinthians 12 shows a small and focused consciousness
It is very simple to know whether a person's mind is set on the spirit; we simply need to ask him if he has peace within
A person who sets his mind on the spirit will sense satisfaction, strength, brightness, freshness, and liveliness
Every form of life has a consciousness; anything without consciousness is not a living organism and has no life
Our regenerated spirit is the three-in-one spirit referred to in Romans 8-our spirit mingled with God's life and with God's Spirit
It tests whether we are living in the Lord or in ourselves, and whether our mind is set on the spirit or on the flesh
In fellowship with the Lord, we need to ask how much ground He has in us and how much spiritual element is in our preaching of the gospel
As a further example, a person who is trained can give the accurate dimensions of a building simply by looking at it
An untrained sister might say that the same building could be as long as two hundred feet or as short as sixty feet
Sometimes we speak in this way; we either overestimate or underestimate because we have not been sufficiently trained
Some people have keen insight; if we put gold in their hands, they can immediately say how much of it is pure gold
Since his son-in-law was trained in the navy, his sight was keen, and he could see what ordinary people could not see
They do not care whether a word should be spoken or whether there is inward peace; they simply speak as they please
Those who ignore their inner sense have not been trained and have not been opened; moreover, they do not have enough heart for God
Everyone who serves God, everyone who serves sinners, and everyone who administrates the church must exercise to have a keen sense
Although we are outwardly listening when we contact a brother or sister, inwardly we should be exercised to sense their true situation
When we checked with each other later, two of us felt that this brother was happy and did not have any problems with his wife
Everything else can be faked but not life; no one can pretend that he has a certain kind of life if he does not have that life
He knows man's real condition, and no one can fool him; people can fool him in practical affairs but not in spiritual things
If we constantly exercise, cultivate, train, and use this sense, it will enable us to detect the problems in the Body
If he pays attention to this sense, cultivating it by fellowshipping with God and obeying the inner sense, it will develop
If we would pay attention to spiritual things, pursuing and learning gradually, we will have feelings when we come to the meetings
If we use and exercise this sense often and if we love God and care for the church, this sense will become the sense of the Body
A member who is in a difficult situation will not bear his burden alone, but his fellow members will bear the burden with him
We will no longer pray for someone simply because he asks us; rather, we will pray out of the burden in the Body
Sometimes one person's prayer is not enough; there is truly the need for the prayer of the Body, but this prayer is still spontaneous
The sense of the brother's difficulty is communicated into him, and the sense of the sister's being pressed is also added to his spirit
If we look at ourselves from this perspective, we must admit that our service is weak because our sense of the Body is weak and poor
When his crisis is over and his spirit is released, our spirit will be released; when he is happy, we will be happy
When a person has a difficulty, everyone else should feel the same way; when a person rejoices, everyone also rejoices together
Because of our self-consideration, our inner sense is suppressed, and even if we had a sense, we would ignore it
We often ignore the sense of the Body when it comes to us and forcibly suppress it, because we are busy taking care of our own situations
As he was preparing to preach the word, he felt very uneasy, but because he did not know why, he tried to suppress this feeling
As he restlessly paced back and forth inside his hotel room, he suddenly had a sense and asked the Lord what it meant
He became clear within and prayed, 'I will apply, by faith, the prayer of the brothers in London on my behalf'
When he returned, he related this incident to the brothers in London, and they asked him when this event happened
In 1900, when the Boxer Rebellion took place, many Western missionaries were persecuted and martyred for the Lord
At that particular point they felt oppressed in their spirit, and they sensed it was related to an unusual matter
Although they were far away in another land, in their spirit they sensed the persecution faced by the believers in China
For the time being, let us not even talk about the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere, or Europe and Asia
We are often shut up within ourselves, and when we see another local church being blessed, we do not rejoice with them
After the saints in Keelung learn that Tamsui has a nice meeting hall, they may say, 'Praise the Lord,' but they are not that happy
Even though the church in Sanchung has built a nice meeting hall, the brothers in other places do not feel very happy
Similarly, it is easier for a person who condemns himself, even though he does not have the feeling from the Lord to do so, to be broken
A person who often condemns himself, rather than justifying himself, often does not need to be broken through outward circumstances
A person who justifies himself and relies on his skill and ability forces God to use the environment to deal with him
Coordination is a spontaneous matter of life; we cannot force ourselves to coordinate, nor can we pretend to coordinate
The degree of our coordination is determined by the degree of our daily tearing down and building up, in God's hand
Without the tearing down and building up, there is no real coordination, even if we force ourselves to work something out
In the 1952 issue of The Ministry of the Word in Chinese, there is a message that specifically speaks of the matter of calling
Today you may not know the Lord's will, but as you grow in the divine life, you will be able to know His will concerning certain things
Some methods may be very useful to certain ones but useless to you and me, because we are short in our level of life
A microscope is very useful in the hands of a thirty-year-old doctor, but it is useless in the hands of a three or five-year-old child
A microscope is a good tool, but only someone who is trained and has a certain level of life knows how to use it
If a young person is not consecrated absolutely in the matter of marriage, it will not be easy for him to know God's will
The objective ones emphasized doctrines and the objective prophecies, and the subjective ones stressed our experience of the Lord
For this reason they bathed themselves and put on white garments and some of them went to the rooftops waiting for the Lord Jesus to return
If the church as the harvest is not mature, we cannot expect the Lord to come back at this time and rapture the church
We must see that the church's rapture is a matter of maturity, and this maturity is the Lord working Himself into us
The Lord works Himself into us until we are mature; that is the time when the Lord will come back, and we will be raptured
Although we are not in heaven today, the Lord's work is to work Himself into us, that is, to work heaven into us
The more we grow, the more the element of heaven is in us; the more mature we become, the more the element of heaven is in us
The place where we will be for eternity in the future, where we and God will be completely mingled, is the New Jerusalem
We cannot say that the New Jerusalem is a place in heaven; the New Jerusalem is a constitution of the believers and the Triune God
We will be transformed to the extent that the New Jerusalem, a city of gold, pearls, and precious stones, will be manifested
Gods salvation is objective to us because our thoughts our emotions and our decisions are all still earthy and we have not been transformed
These prepared stones were not unrefined, useless stones; rather, they were stones that had been smitten, dealt with, and made useful
He does this so that every part of our being can be transformed becoming heavenly until one day we are completely ripe and ready for harvest
Before the Lord takes us up into heaven, He has worked the heavenly nature and reality into us through His heavenly life and the Holy Spirit
Heaven desires only heavenly things, such as gold, pearls, and precious stones; heaven does not want anything of earth
We need to see this subjective matter and allow the Lord to daily work in us in order to daily transform us from earth into gold
Question: In the coordination of the Body, how can we know clearly what our portion is and carry it out properly?
Answer: Concerning the coordination of the Body, we need to stress that every brother and sister must carry out their function
In the past some brothers and sisters spoke clearly that they truly knew what their portion was before the Lord
If God desires the work to fall apart, that falling apart is much better than maintaining a 'good' situation with our own hands
The important question should come from our inner sense: Are we doing the work in ourselves, or are we doing it after being torn down?
If we are willing to ask ourselves this question, we will discover that there are many things we should not have
We will also discover that many of our activities exceed our limit and that we are not functioning according to our actual portion
We should believe that the Holy Spirit and the Lord are responsible and not be overly concerned about the situation
By our not restricting and trampling the brothers and sisters, others will be raised up in our locality, and the Body will spread
Acts 2:42 says, 'They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers'
The coordination of the Body, the order or authority in the Body, and the consciousness of the Body are closely related
Without the order and authority, there is no coordination; without the consciousness of the Body, the coordination is not practical
In the Body of Christ, fellowship is very practical; moreover, the Body of Christ cannot leave this fellowship even for one moment
Once he receives the Lord, the Lord's life enters him and causes him to desire to fellowship with God's children when he sees them
After receiving God's life, he not only yearns to have fellowship with the children of God but also understands the story within them
He also feels inwardly dry, as if something is missing, when he is unable to see the children of God for a period of time
Many times when we meet another child of God, although we may not say much outwardly, there is a mutual flow, a communication, between us
The electric current in the light bulbs is the fellowship of the light bulbs; this is an illustration of the meaning of fellowship
Doctors tell us that the blood in our body is flowing very quickly; it flows very quickly and also through our body many times every minute
Due to this circulation, all the improper things in our body are removed, and all the nutrients we need are supplied to us
The fellowship of the Body is the circulation of the life of Christ in us, which is also the circulation of the Spirit of life in us
There is the accumulation of many improper things within them, which creates problems; as a consequence, the Body of Christ becomes ill
Even though we sit for an hour in these meetings, not listening to messages or testimonies, there is a fellowship in the depth of our spirit
We may feel somewhat despondent before a meeting, but during the meeting, we spontaneously feel a flow in our inner being
We may not listen to many messages, yet we are enlivened simply by praising and praying together with all the saints
While everyone was singing, he suddenly became clear and enlightened; the difficulty ended and the burden was relieved
If we were to ask this brother what happened, he would be perplexed, unable to explain; however, the difficulty in him was gone
The Chinese medical doctors do not advocate cutting away or killing germs; rather, they help the blood in the human body to circulate
When we encounter difficulties, we often ask the Lord to perform 'surgery' in us and to kill all the 'germs' in us, but this does not work
Those who are experienced can all testify that once they stop seeing the brothers and sisters, they can no longer live
The fellowship among the members often causes the supply to flow into us, and it discharges whatever should not be in us
If the brothers and sisters are not there listening while they speak, they will probably finish speaking in only ten minutes
It is often not the speaker who is supplying the brothers and sisters but the brothers and sisters who are supplying the speaker
If there was no one listening, they would probably finish after ten sentences even if they wanted to speak over a hundred
If the brothers and sisters are gathered there, they may be unable to finish after a hundred sentences, even if they started with only ten
They marvel at Christians who attend meetings every day, spending three hours in a meeting even after working eight hours in the office
Afterward, the facts proved that the way was of the Lord, of the Spirit, of light, full of wisdom, and of benefit to the Body
The fellowship of the Body is not only needed by the brothers and sisters individually; it is also needed by a church or the work
If a church trusts only in direct fellowship with the Lord and despises the fellowship of the Body, that church will definitely wither
Although we emphasize the giving of messages in every conference, we treasure much more the fellowship with all the saints
There are now thirty-five localities on the island that have established bread-breaking meetings, which means that they are local churches
The meetings in these places were not established by the workers; they were raised up through the fellowship of the brothers and sisters
Some localities began with one saint who, after attending a conference, returned to his locality and raised up a meeting
After two to three months they began breaking bread, and there are presently twenty to thirty saints in their locality
As soon as we fellowship with some brothers and sisters, we become clear concerning the matter and have the leading
When we fellowship with newly saved believers, who were recently baptized, we can receive a fresh supply and be refreshed
The marvelous thing is that we may think that we are helping others when we teach them, but actually we are being helped by them
Although we should not make distinctions when fellowshipping, there is still a matter of the degree of fellowship
Although it is possible for there to be mutual understanding in fellowship, it is also possible to have a lack
If all the brothers and sisters in the church as members of one another grow in this way our fellowship will be like water boiling in a pot
Since the meeting is 'boiling,' the water in this meeting is always 'boiling,' always fellowshipping, and always growing
After fellowshipping, we may realize that we were unable to understand each other because our spiritual levels are different
For this reason, we should not only avoid distinctions when we fellowship, but we should also not condemn others and not criticize them
If we go too high, our fellowship will not benefit them but will rather push them to death; if this is the case, there will be a loss
We need to realize that the brothers and sisters around us are like the wives, children, and flocks led by Jacob
Fellowship is often lost in the Body because those who are deeper and higher do not want to accommodate those who are not as advanced
On the one hand, we need to fellowship with the Lord; on the other hand, we need to fellowship with the saints and the churches
Everyone seems to have some knowledge concerning the flesh, but whenever a situation arises, we all have our opinions
Our meetings should be wonderful because we have so many full-time serving ones in the coordination in our service
If the inward problems are not removed, the Holy Spirit will be unable to rule in us or have a way to go on among us
In other words, the co-workers hold on tightly to their own small portion of service, and they bear only their burden and responsibility
Some serving ones feel very lonely, because they feel that they are serving and bearing responsibilities by themselves
As a result, our situation can be compared to that of a government office in ancient China or to an organization
Although some brothers in the hall, including deacons and full-time serving ones, saw this brother, no one took care of him
It seems as if the result of learning to obey and submit to authority is that each one takes care of only his responsibility
Broken glass in the meeting hall or lights not being turned off at night are not our business; it is Brother So-and-so's responsibility
Our lack of care is the reason for the low attendance in the meetings when there are so many brothers and sisters
If we consider this matter from the perspective of gospel preaching, our situation is because we pay attention only to saving sinners
Apparently, this word sounds very touching and reasonable, but at the same time, it fits the taste of typically zealous Christians
Many years ago we seriously warned the saints that we cannot focus only on preaching the gospel and ignore the increase and growth of life
Those who are brought in through our zealous preaching will not receive much supply or be sustained by the fellowship in the meetings
John Sung led thousands of people to repentance and belief in the Lord in China; however, not many of them remained
The condition of gospel preaching in Christianity is that there is no appropriate place to feed the saved ones
Our life has not come up to the level of the move of the gospel, and our life cannot hold the result of the gospel
We have gained two hundred baptized ones, but we do not have the capacity that is needed to support two hundred people
According to church history, the growth in life in the church was the origin of the spread of the gospel to China by Western missionaries
The growth of life in the church in Western countries produced a group of Christians who were sent by the Lord to preach the gospel in China
Today gospel preaching is weakened because our life has not caught up-our life does not match the result of the gospel
We need the Lord's mercy so that as serving ones we would be willing to receive the inward shining and breaking before the Lord
Any kind of method, instruction, organization, and even arrangement cannot cause us to have a good coordination
As long as we have a heart and are willing to receive mercy and the breaking and shining, our coordination will not be a difficult matter
Because the saints have all learned some lessons in the church life, they do not desire to contend and dare not contend
Because there is not enough shining, although there is no outward contention or argument, they are unable to get through within
As much as possible, we should reduce our involvement in these matters so that we have time to prepare for spiritual matters
Besides not allowing ourselves to be entangled by practical church matters, we also must be able to receive the Lord's commission
If such a brother moves to a new place and becomes a responsible one, he will be unable to sleep at night because the burdens are too heavy
Please keep in mind that if a serving one can bear responsibility only when he goes to a certain place, his responsibility is of the flesh
Whether there is an arrangement or authority our fellowship with the Lord our concern for people and our care for souls should be the same
Not having the expression of life in one place but doing something out of responsibility in another place is not of life
We should always receive a commission from the Lord when we contact people, either receiving help from others or rendering help to them
When the responsible brothers of the various halls learn of this, they may begin to negotiate among themselves
After much negotiation, each one retains his own understanding, and no one has been struck down in their inner being
We should not be happy simply because the church in our locality is strong; we can have real joy only when the church of the Lord is strong
We must see that man is selfish and that even in spiritual matters man can express the selfishness of the flesh
Concerning our coordination, there are problems in every place, and the most serious problem is the problem among the responsible ones
Some people have a doorway and windows, but because they do not have a door or windowpanes, their doorway and windows are always open
There are also people who can be compared to a steel wall-no one can touch what is within them because their whole being is closed
If we were to ask them whether they agree or disagree, they would not express anything; to them, both are right and neither is right
No matter how angry others are, they will not become angry, and no matter how hard people laugh, they remain unmoved
We did not know whether this 'leading' was of the flesh and the natural being or of the Holy Spirit and revelation
Some took credit for all the accomplishments, some complained that they were despised, and still others felt that they were misunderstood
Anyone who desires to lead people must grow in life; only through the growth in life can our capacity to lead people be increased
The older brothers and sisters in the church should bear some responsibility to help young people in the matter of marriage
We should not serve in this matter simply because we love to do this kind of thing and have a feeling for this
Excited prayer may not cause people to touch spiritual matters; however, this does not mean that we are against excited prayer
The attendance in the meetings is only about one-third of the entire church; most of the saints do not meet regularly
They truly need our help, but we feel that we are short of people and thus are unable to give them the proper help
If our service to them could be strengthened, we believe that the Lord's testimony could be quickly raised up in those places
They have been blessed by the Lord and now have about thirty people in the morning and evening meetings on the Lord's Day
Although two or three of them are more advanced, they do not desire to bear the responsibility of the local church before the Lord
In the past we have said strongly that in leading the churches we should pay proper attention to the practical matters of the church
Simply speaking, the primary focus of a local church is to give the brothers and sisters a step-by-step leading in the spiritual life
Although we cannot say that every baptized one is genuinely saved, we can say that at least ninety-five percent of them are truly saved
Visiting, fellowshipping, shepherding, and teaching are responsibilities that rest on the shoulders of the saints
If our meetings cause people to sense and receive a spiritual supply, they will desire to come to the meetings
Rather than only feel that they should come to the meetings, they will come because they are hungry for the spiritual supply
It seems as if everyone lets the meeting take its own course; no one bears responsibility and no one is a mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit
When we eat something that tastes bad, we do not want to eat it again, and if we do eat it again, we will loathe it
In the same principle, if the meetings are lacking in supply, the brothers and sisters will stop coming after two or three times
Some saints love the Lord, fear the Lord, and pursue the Lord; they feel that as Christians they should always meet together
They are troubled because although they know that it is necessary to meet, they suffer much when they meet together
The responsible brothers and the full-time serving ones in the church have no excuse; they should bear the responsibility
If they do not need to give a message, the meeting will often be affected by their indifference, because no one is responsible
Some saints, who are professionals, work during the day and must hurry in order to make it to the meetings, even forsaking their meal
When the meeting is over, the working saints go home quickly, and most of the full-time serving ones also go home unconcerned
As serving ones we should put our heart in our work, our service, day and night, hour by hour, and moment by moment
Whenever we have an opportunity to meet someone, we should immediately give him 'a shot' so that he can be supplied
We should always minister to people, whether it is an opportune time or not, or whether they feel happy or not
If someone does not cooperate by working, when God abundantly pours out His blessing, it will not flow to that person
If the Lord's servants are uninterested and unresponsive when they contact souls, they should not be in this line of work
Businessmen know how to respond to business; no matter where they are, they will respond to their particular business
We should generate business as soon as we meet people; if we cannot generate business, we should go and pray to the Lord
If we are not clear, we should pray to the Lord, even spending a few days to pray and touch the Lord's leading
The saints should regularly and spontaneously help people to be saved not because of any encouragement arrangement or decision of the church
When there is a baptism in the meeting hall, the saints should be able to bring people to be baptized, not paying attention to outward form
We need to ask the Lord to give us a new start in this matter; otherwise, in the long run, we will suffer serious loss on the spiritual side
In principle, when there are twenty to thirty people meeting in a locality, there should be a local church there
Strictly speaking, no matter how weak a group of brothers and sisters are in a locality, we should always give them the opportunity
Much of our strength is the result of falling down; a great percentage of our insight is developed through our constant mistakes
We seem to think that only the things that we do can be done correctly; thus, we do not easily let go of things
If the only place in the world with a meeting is in Fengyuan with its twenty weak brothers and sisters, Fengyuan can still be a local church
When the saints in a locality gather together in the Lord's name and exhibit Christ together, that is an expression of the church
If they still desire to depend on us, we need to encourage them that they must bear this responsibility before the Lord
The church in Taichung should always give the saints in Fengyuan the impression that the meeting is the responsibility of Fengyuan
In this way, the church will flourish, and the brothers will have the opportunity to contact God and receive grace from Him
During the process of being exposed, we struggle within, and even though we know what we should do, we often do not manifest it
We know what the Lord desires, but we cannot meet the demand or are unable to measure up to the standard of the Lord
We should learn quickly, advance, and be quite transformed, but even after many years these problems are still with us
Although we do this several times a year, we frequently become lax and negligent in caring for and perfecting the brothers and sisters
According to our observation, the brothers and sisters are willing to do only what they can do, not what they cannot do
The condition of our service is not ideal and there is only limited improvement because there is not much study and research
Our shortage is that even though we do not know how to do things we still sleep very well at night we do not shed tears and we do not study
There is no progress in our work, but we can still lie in bed and say that everything depends on God's mercy and grace
Some people may say that this person is Jacob; however, we must say that only a person who wrestles with God becomes Israel
Many brothers and sisters often come to us and tell us that they do not know how to do something and that they are not good at something
In the Lord's work, no one comes to work because he knows how to work; God does not desire this kind of person
The real work is to work even when we do not know how to work and to lead even when we do not know how to lead
We may have failures in our work, but we must continue working; we may have failures in our leading, but we must continue leading
We should not say that this young brother is useless in everything, but in that particular matter he had become useless
A person may say that eighty or a hundred people need gospel visitations, even though only fifty-eight actually need to be visited
Even in his dreams he would be considering who would be the best persons to visit them, what is the best time, and how to lead them
When he meets people, he should immediately have a response of loving them, caring for them, and being interested in them
A person who serves the Lord should easily receive burdens from God and easily be interested in and responsive to people
We have spoken concerning this point before, but our practice has been too poor, and we have not been well trained
The younger brothers and sisters have not experienced much mercy and grace from the Lord's hand through His dealings
The gift of grace that we have originally is sufficient, but if we are unwilling to use it, it will be nullified in us and become nothing
If we are willing to use it, and to continue to do business , we will see the capital of grace in us increase more and more
In this way, we can become useful persons and channels of blessing in the Lord's hand to bring in more blessing
In recent days we have begun to feel that our vessels are too small; if we take care of one item, we cannot take care of another item
After they pray before the Lord in tears, marvelously, they become very fluent when they stand up to speak for the Lord
Our experience of the Lord involves enlarging; it does not cause us to become proud, but it causes us to be enlarged
A person is narrow because he is not willing to be broken, and a person's unwillingness to be broken causes him to become narrow
When we lead the brothers and sisters, we should give them the feeling that our service is like fire burning in the thornbush
We need to see that we are in God's hands, that it is He who is using us, and that it is His holy fire burning in us
We need to see that we are a thornbush, which is useless, but this should not discourage us, because the fire can burn in the thornbush
The Israelites could be saved by the fire that was burning in the thornbush, not because of the thornbush itself
When Moses stood before Pharaoh, it was a scene of the fierce fire burning in a thornbush, and Pharaoh could not withstand it
