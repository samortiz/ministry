Many people live with 'flat tires' in their lives; they are depressed and plod along life's journey in a bumpy way
We need electricity to drive the fan, the clock, the refrigerator, the telephone, the doorbell, the television, and many other appliances
Although electricity is so applicable, the source of electricity is far away from us in the hydroelectric power plant
In order for that mighty power to be applied to us, there is the need of power lines to convey the current of electricity to us
The electrical current applies the power and turns it into sound, light, heat, and other useful forms in our homes
What man needs is not bigger buildings or more religious ceremonies; none of these will give him the inward power
Today, the Spirit is 'installed' in this universe Christ has accomplished all the work, and as the life-giving Spirit, He is now everywhere
The process did not stop there; after His death He resurrected and was transformed into the form of the Spirit
Christ said, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
Today, various forms of plant life and animal life abound on this earth, and men with the human life also fill the entire globe
All these forms of life are wonderful; but there is a fourth kind of life the divine life, which is God's uncreated life

A person who eats any earthly or physical bread will hunger again, even if that bread is a miracle sent from God
The Lord declared that He is the light of the world and that those who follow Him will not walk in darkness but have the light of life
Just as our human life is sustained by eating food and drinking water, so the divine life is received by the way of eating and drinking
Christ as Spirit and life is real today, but He cannot be realized by means of our soul, that is, our mind, emotion, and will
If you try to understand Him with your mind or feel Him with your emotion, you will not be able to experience Him
The best way to eat and drink of Christ is to pray by calling on His name and to read the Bible by praying with the words of the Bible
In the same way, by eating Christ as the spiritual food and drinking the Spirit as the water of life, our spiritual life will grow
