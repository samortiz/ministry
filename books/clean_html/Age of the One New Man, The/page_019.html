<h2 class="head2">Going to the Smaller and Weaker Churches<br />
to Strengthen the Testimony</h2>
<p>The second aspect of our need is for the smaller and weaker churches. There is a need for the younger generation to be led by the Lord to go to the smaller and weaker churches in order to bear the responsibility and strengthen the testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going to the Satellite Towns of Major Cities<br />
to Establish Churches on the Proper Ground</h2>
<p>The third aspect of our need is for the satellite towns of major cities. In some of these towns there are ten to twenty saints, but the church has not yet been established, because the saints are not strong enough to bear the responsibility of the testimony of a local church. The young working saints need to receive a burden from the Lord to go to these places to preach the gospel and establish churches on the proper ground in coordination with the local saints.</p>
<p>Our urgent need is to raise up younger saints to continue the eldership, to strengthen the smaller and weaker churches, and to establish churches in satellite towns. The stronger churches are normal, healthy, and stable, but the elders are older and cannot do too much; they therefore lack the strength to push forward. Hence, the younger generation needs to rise up and bear the responsibility in order to push forward the various aspects of the work. There is also the need for a group of strong and burdened younger saints to strengthen the testimony in the smaller and weaker churches. This will turn the smaller and weaker churches into stronger churches. The major cities in Taiwan, such as Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, have satellite towns, where a small number of saints are residing. These saints love the Lord, but they are not strong enough to establish a church. Because these are satellite towns of major cities that have local churches, it should be easy for these towns to receive help and supply from the churches in the major cities. Hence, the young saints need to receive the burden to strengthen the local testimony in these towns for the establishing of churches on the proper ground.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going to Remote Towns to Establish Churches</h2>
<p>The fourth aspect of our need is for the remote towns. According to the trend of the mobility of people in Taiwan, most students and skilled people have moved to the big cities. When we preach the gospel, we are like fishermen (Matt. 4:19). Fishermen go fishing where there are schools of fish. My hometown, Chefoo, was a fishing harbor. The wise fishermen did not usually catch big fish, because big fish are difficult to handle. The experienced fishermen caught fish that were neither too big nor too small. When they cast their net, they caught a multitude of fish. This is the wise way. Fishermen always go where there are large schools of fish. Hence, as fishers of men, we must go where there are crowds of people.</p>
<p>However, there are many small towns in Taiwan. Even though people tend to move to big cities, there are still many people in the small towns. These towns may not have colleges and high schools, but they have junior high schools. If we have insight, we will see that the most effective way to preach the gospel is to begin with the children. We need a children&rsquo;s work that begins with young children and continues to students in junior high school. It should also include students in high schools and colleges.</p>
<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966, I encouraged the brothers in Taipei to work with the goal of gaining ten thousand children to meet every week in the meeting halls or in the saints&rsquo; homes. These meetings do not have to be on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. They may be held on an afternoon or in the evening during the week. We should not be limited to the meeting halls. Many saints may open their homes to serve the children. Whether we teach the children to sing hymns or tell them stories, they will be happy.</p>
<p>At that time the church in Taipei had approximately twenty-three thousand saints, of which at least two thousand were young families. If each family had two or three children, there would have been five to six thousand children in the church in Taipei. In addition, the saints&rsquo; relatives, friends, and neighbors also have children. Therefore, I was confident that the number of children could reach ten thousand. If there were ten thousand children ten years ago, now they all would be in junior high school. These ten thousand students would be our gospel seeds, who can preach the gospel to their schoolmates. Every student in junior high school should be able to lead at least one schoolmate to salvation. Thus, these ten thousand students would become twenty thousand. After three years these twenty thousand high-school seniors would graduate, and at least one-third of them would go to college. Thus, we would have seven thousand brothers and sisters as gospel soldiers in all the colleges.</p>
<p>I am neither complaining nor blaming anyone, but if I were taking the lead in the church in Taipei, I would be involved with the children&rsquo;s work. The brothers who go to the small towns should receive the burden to work with the children and the students in junior high school. In order to teach in a junior high school, a person must graduate from a university or a junior college. The young working saints who have a heart to serve the Lord all have this level of education. The people in the small towns might not have graduated from a junior college, but they are simple and can accept the gospel. Because of their level of education and their character, the young working saints will be a positive influence in the small towns. In this way they will lead some children or some students in junior high school to know and believe in the Lord. Through these children and students we will be able to contact their parents and lead them to receive the gospel. This can be accomplished.</p>
<p>The saints who come to the Lord and go forth with a commission do not care for position or enjoyment. Hence, no one who goes forth for the Lord will starve to death. I hope that the younger saints will all go to the Lord and pray. The one way before us is to go to the small towns and contact the students by teaching in the elementary schools and in the junior high schools. Then it will be easy to lead children to know the Lord or to lead the students in junior high school to salvation. After we lead people to accept the gospel, we can establish a church.</p>
