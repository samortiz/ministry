   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>By Its Members Being Perfected to Do</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Work of the New Testament Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The growth of the Body is by the Body's members being perfected to do the work of the New Testament ministry the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only in Christianity but also among us, very often the saints cannot function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reason for this is that we are short of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are growing day by day, we will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then when we come to the meetings, either we will offer a prayer or we will say, "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This indicates that we are living.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But today's situation is for the most part not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have attended prayer meetings where the saints and even the leading ones came in five, ten, or fifteen minutes after the scheduled time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As a result, the entire meeting was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is impossible for a church in this condition to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to be living, to be growing, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the whole church will grow, and this growth equals the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the growth of the Body all the members are perfected to do the work of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This work is done not by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, or shepherd-teachers, but by the ordinary, common members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When each member is perfected to do the work of the New Testament ministry, all the members will know how to build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The building up is the New Testament work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If all the saints are carrying out the work of the ministry, the meetings will become living, and we will escape the deadened situation of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Life of God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The building up of the Body is by the Body's growth in the life of God Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, it is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Process of Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The building up of the Body also takes place in the process of transformation 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today as we are growing, we are in the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Spontaneously, we are being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be transformed is not to change, to adjust ourselves, or to correct ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are mere outward changes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Transformation is metabolic, something within in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During every meal as we take food into our stomach, digestion, a metabolic process, immediately begins to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For the stomach to move metabolically, it must be filled with some element.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have experienced this metabolic process in eating many times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day after speaking in a meeting, I was physically exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Twenty minutes after eating some food, I was vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A metabolic process had begun to go on within me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After another ten minutes, I was even more vitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was not only vitalized; I was transformed by the metabolic process within me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an illustration of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to grow that we may be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After being transformed, we are suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By the Building Up of Itself</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ephesians 4:16 says that the Body grows unto the building up of itself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that the growth of the Body is the Body's building up of itself.</S>
