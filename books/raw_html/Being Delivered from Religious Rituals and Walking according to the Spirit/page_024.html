        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH AND OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<p>The reality of the church is in our spirit. This is a simple statement, yet it is very profound. The majority of Christians know the Holy Spirit, but they do not know the human spirit. The reality of the church is not only in the Holy Spirit but also in our spirit. If the reality of the church were only in the Holy Spirit, the church would be abstract and far away from us. The reality of the church must also be in our spirit in order for the church to be practical. The church as the reality is in your spirit and also in my spirit. It is in the spirit of every person who is saved, loves the Lord, and lives in his spirit. In relation to the reality of the church, Ephesians presents four main points concerning the human spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FILLED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to have the reality of the church, we must be filled in our spirit with the Spirit of God. Human beings have a physical body, and they have a spirit within them. Our body needs water and at least three meals a day. Some people like to drink wine. When they drink too much wine, they become drunk. Ephesians 5:18 shows a contrast between being filled with wine and being filled in spirit. The first part of this verse says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness.&rdquo; This means that we should not fill our body with wine; that is, we should not allow our body to be filled with wine. The second part of the verse says, &ldquo;But be filled in spirit.&rdquo; This means that our spirit should be filled with God.</p>
<p>This word corresponds to other portions of the Bible that speak of God as our spiritual wine. In the Bible wine symbolizes God as the One who can quench our thirst, make us joyful, cause us to be excited, and give us power (Matt. 9:17). We should not be drunk with physical wine, but we should be filled with God. On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit. Those who saw them said, &ldquo;They are full of new wine!&rdquo; (Acts 2:13).</p>
<p>God can fill us because God is Spirit. In His economy God was incarnated and came to the earth as our Redeemer, Jesus Christ. After His death and resurrection, as the last Adam, He became the life-giving Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord as the Spirit can fill our inward being, just as air fills a container.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way to Be Filled in Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>There is a simple way to be filled in spirit. Acts 2:17 says, &ldquo;It shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit.&rdquo; Verse 21 says, &ldquo;It shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; God has poured out His Spirit, but how can we be filled with this Spirit? The way to be filled with the Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord: &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; In order for air to enter a room, we need to open the window. As soon as a window is open, air comes in. Likewise, in order for the Spirit to fill us, we need to open up the window of our being. The window of our being is more complicated than the window in a room. The window in a room has only one layer, but the window of our being has three layers. The first layer is our body. The way to open this layer is to open our mouth. When our mouth is open, our body is open. The second layer is the soul, or our heart. We have to open not only our mouth but also our heart. It is not enough to open only these two layers. There is a third layer, which is our human spirit. Our spirit also needs to be open. Sometimes when we call on the Lord, our mouth is open, but our heart is not open. In order to call on the Lord from the deepest part of our being, we must open our mouth, our heart, and our spirit.</p>
<p>Some do not agree with calling on the Lord. It is not a matter of whether or not we agree, because calling is just as necessary as breathing (Lam. 3:55-56). The most profitable exercise for our body is deep breathing; likewise, the most profitable exercise for our spiritual life is deep breathing. For the first ten years of my life as a Christian, I was a dumb believer. I was dumb even when I prayed. Gradually, I realized that it makes a difference whether a Christian prays audibly or inaudibly.</p>
<p>About forty years ago in Shanghai, someone asked Brother Nee what he should do in order to prevent himself from falling asleep when he prayed. Another person asked how to stop his mind from wandering when he prayed. Brother Nee replied, &ldquo;If you pray audibly, you will not fall asleep, and your mind will not wander.&rdquo; This is truly effective. Even if we are sleepy, we will not fall asleep when we pray audibly. Similarly, when we pray audibly, our mind does not wander. Hence, praying audibly is useful.</p>
<p>I discovered calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name in the Word. The Greek word for <em>call on</em> implies calling out with an audible voice or calling out loudly, just as Stephen did (Acts 7:59-60). Before Paul was saved, he persecuted Christians. He even received authority from the chief priests to bind those who called on the Lord&rsquo;s name (9:14; cf. v. 21). This indicates that he did not have to search a house in order to find and arrest the Christians. The Lord&rsquo;s disciples were callers; they called on the name of the Lord. Everyone knew that they called on the Lord&rsquo;s name. This is also the situation in the church in Los Angeles. More than two hundred saints live around the meeting hall, and all the neighbors know that the saints are believers, because from morning to night the saints always call, &ldquo;O Lord! Jesus is Lord! Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s disciples called on the Lord&rsquo;s name because calling on the Lord is equivalent to breathing the Lord. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; the Lord comes into us. This is the way to be filled with the Lord. The Lord has given us a very simple secret: we need only to call on His name in order to be filled with Him. However, when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, we must allow Him to do a burning work within us. When we call on the Lord, He may touch a certain sin or something of the world in us, or He may touch the self. When He touches something, we must deal with it and confess it. This is the way to be filled with the Lord by calling on His name.</p>
<p>When we are filled with the Lord, we become the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19b). The Lord is the Spirit, and the Lord is God. Hence, to be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the Lord, to be filled with the Lord is to be filled with God, and to be filled with God is to be filled with the riches of God unto the fullness of God. The result of our calling on the Lord is that we are filled with all that God is. In order to have the reality of the church, we need to be filled with all that God is. Many of us are not filled with God in our spirit. Some of us open our mouth when we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and some do not. It is difficult to be filled in our spirit when we do not open our mouth to call on the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a difference in our experience between calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name and not calling. We should not think that it is all right for the young ones to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name but that this is not so proper for the older ones. Some may say that it is unbecoming for the saints who are professors or managers to call on the Lord when they come to the meeting. If we take care of outward appearances, we will not gain the Lord or have His fullness. Those who call on the Lord&rsquo;s name know that it is a great blessing to call on His name. If we are sad when we call, we become happy; if we are afraid, we become bold; and if we are in darkness, we receive light. When we call on the Lord, we must open up our mouth, our heart, and our spirit and call from deep within.</p>
<p>We cannot force anyone to call on the Lord. However, we can pray for him to open his mouth and call on the Lord. I would like to speak a frank word. We do not want calling to become a religion. When we call, we should take care of others. Once there was a group of saints singing while another group of saints stood beside them calling on the Lord. This made the meeting chaotic. Whether we call on the Lord or sing, we should take care of the meeting.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
